Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer's failure to properly validate permissions during the secure creation of registry keys. This improper validation allows an attacker to potentially gain elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The core weakness is the improper permission validation in Internet Explorer, leading to an elevation of privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain elevated privileges within the context of Internet Explorer, specifically medium integrity level privileges, which are the same as the current user's permissions.
- This elevation of privilege, combined with a separate remote code execution vulnerability, would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack Scenario:** An attacker can host a malicious webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:** Websites compromised by attackers or websites that accept user-provided content may host malicious code.
- The user must be convinced to visit the malicious website for the exploit to be successful. This is often done through social engineering tactics, such as enticing the user to click a link in an email or instant message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page that can be accessed by the target user.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to trick the user into visiting the malicious webpage.
- **Chaining with other exploits:** The exploit by itself does not lead to arbitrary code execution. It needs to be chained with other remote code execution vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes**
- The document indicates that the vulnerability is an elevation of privilege, not a remote code execution vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is described as "Important" severity across various versions of Internet Explorer.
- The vulnerability is addressed by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer.
- The information about this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the bulletin.
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft through coordinated vulnerability disclosure by James Forshaw of Context Information Security.
