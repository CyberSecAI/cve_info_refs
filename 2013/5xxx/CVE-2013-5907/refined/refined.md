Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5907:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An insufficient input validation check flaw within the ICU Layout Engine's LookupProcessor in the OpenJDK 2D component. This allows a specially crafted font file to trigger a crash, memory corruption or arbitrary code execution within a Java application or applet.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient input validation:** The core issue lies in the lack of proper checks on the input font data processed by the ICU Layout Engine. Specifically, the `LookupProcessor` in OpenJDK's 2D component does not sufficiently validate the font file which could lead to memory corruption.
*   **Bypassing Java sandbox restrictions:** A malicious applet or application can exploit the vulnerability to bypass sandbox restrictions and gain unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory corruption:** Processing of a crafted font file can corrupt Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory, leading to application crashes or other undefined behaviour.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:**  In some circumstances, the memory corruption could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*  **Java sandbox bypass**: An attacker can execute code without proper permission.
*   **Information disclosure**: A Java application using the vulnerable component could leak sensitive information or experience a denial of service
*   **Application availability**: Exploiting XXE vulnerabilities can lead to application unavailability.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious font file:** The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a specially crafted font file.
*   **Untrusted Java application/applet:** An attacker can use an untrusted Java applet or application to load malicious font files in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to deliver a crafted font file:** The attacker must be able to make a user or application process a malicious font file. This could involve hosting a web page with a malicious Java applet, sending the file in an email, etc.
*   **Ability to run untrusted code (Applet, application):** The attacker requires the ability to execute code on the target machine through a Java application or an applet.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is described by Red Hat as an issue in "ICU: Layout Engine LookupProcessor insufficient input checks".
*  The vulnerability is caused by a flaw found in the way the Networking component of OpenJDK checked permissions of code to listen on network ports.
*  The issue has been fixed in Oracle JDK 7u51, 6u71 and 5.0u61.
*  The vulnerability is also mentioned to be fixed in IcedTea7 2.3.13 and 2.4.4, IcedTea6 1.12.8 and 1.13.1.
* OpenJDK7 upstream commits: <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u/jdk/rev/e6160aedadd5> and  <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u/jdk/rev/e935cd4139c6>
* OpenJDK7 upstream commit that resolves the issue: <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u/jdk/rev/9d29c19f1de1>
*   This vulnerability is addressed in multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs), affecting different versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
*  The fix improves checks added in the fix for [CVE-2012-1713](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1713).
