Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-5093:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of pickled Python objects within the Graphite web application. The `pickle` module in Python is known to be unsafe when used to unpickle data from untrusted sources, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The Graphite web application uses the `pickle.loads()` function to deserialize data received through HTTP POST requests. This function interprets the pickled data as instructions, which, if crafted maliciously, can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the pickled data before deserialization, making it susceptible to exploitation.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By sending a specially crafted pickled payload, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the Graphite web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve:
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control over the system.
- **System Compromise:** The attacker can use the RCE to install malware, steal sensitive data, disrupt services, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted pickled payload through an HTTP POST request to the `/render/local` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Graphite web application.
- **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests with a specific structure containing the malicious pickled data.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a payload that uses the `cposix.system` function to execute arbitrary commands.
- The vulnerability is located in the `graphite.render.views`, `graphite.remote_storage`, `graphite.render.datalib`, `graphite.storage` and `graphite.whitelist.views` modules where `pickle.loads()` was used to deserialize objects.
- Patches involve replacing `pickle.loads()` with a safe unpickler (`graphite.util.unpickle.loads`), which restricts the types of objects that can be deserialized, mitigating the RCE vulnerability.
- The vulnerable versions of Graphite web are between 0.9.5 and 0.9.10, inclusive.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.9.11 by implementing the safe unpickler.
