The provided content is related to CVE-2013-5313.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue in BigTree CMS. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper CSRF protection in the user creation and update functionalities, specifically in `create.php` and `update.php` files located in the `/core/admin/modules/users/` directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF: The application doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page. This page will then create or modify user accounts in the BigTree CMS without the admin's consent. 
- The attacker could create new administrative accounts to gain full control over the CMS, or modify existing accounts to escalate privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious web pages: An attacker would host a malicious webpage that, when visited by an authenticated administrator of the BigTree CMS, would perform actions like user creation/modification via a forged request.
- Social engineering: The attacker could use social engineering techniques to entice an administrator to visit the malicious webpage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and entice a logged-in administrator to visit the page.
- The attacker does not need to have prior access to the CMS.
