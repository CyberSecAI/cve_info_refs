Security advisory numbering:
    CVE-2013-5638
    ACSA-2013-006 (related to ACSA-2013-007)

Vendor:
    Transcend
    http://www.transcend-info.com/

Product(s):
    Transcend WiFiSD
    http://www.transcend-info.com/products/Catlist.asp?FldNo=24

Product version(s) affected:
    firmware versions <= WiFiSD_1.8
    ACTION ITEM on vendor: kind request to confirm all the affected software/firmware revisions

CWE categories:
    CWE-79: Persistent/Stored XSS
    CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
    CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information

Vulnerability details:
    CWE-79: Persistent/Stored XSS
        The following fields are affected in the http://WiFiSD_IP/cgi-bin/kcard_edit_config_insup.pl
            WiFiSettings:
                SSID
                Pre-shared key

            Internet Hotspot Settings
                SSID1
                KEY1
                SSID2
                KEY2
                SSID2
                KEY2
        The JS client-side only validation check_pass() and check_string() do not provide sufficient means to
        stop persistent XSS injection attack.
        The persistent XSS can be injected directly into /etc/wsd.conf or the
        check_pass() and check_string() execution circumvented.

    CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
        http://WiFiSD_IP/cgi-bin/get_config.pl
        http://WiFiSD_IP/cgi-bin/kcard_edit_config.pl
        http://WiFiSD_IP/cgi-bin/kcard_edit_config_insup.pl (WiFiSD only)
        http://WiFiSD_IP/cgi-bin/kcard_save_config.pl
        http://WiFiSD_IP/cgi-bin/kcard_save_config_insup.pl (WiFiSD only)

        Also, the page /cgi-bin/kcard_edit_config.pl loads directly the password values in the "input" fields "value=" property.
        Since the password fields are of "type=password", a _normal user_ normally sees something like "*******" and not the value of the password itself.
        Hence, setting password fields values to the password itself is useless from UI point of view.
        It's more feasible just to set it to text filled with '*' of the length of the password, or better with a random length so not to leak info on the password length.

    CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
        wsd.conf
            stored as: /etc/wsd.conf
            served via: http://WiFiSD_IP/cgi-bin/get_config.pl

        Anyone taking posession or intercepting wsd.conf (via clear-text HTTP) get's several more credentials (like FTP and WiFi), which maximizes the
        attack surface onto the user's other systems.

    NOTE: In certain versions/products, the above applies only to authenticated/admin user, somehow minimizing attack surface, but doesn't help systems with default passwords.

### A Large-Scale Analysis of the Security of Embedded Firmwares

In Proceedings of the [23nd USENIX Security Symposium](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14), August 2014.

#### Abstract

As embedded systems are more than ever present in our society, their security is becoming an increasingly important issue. However, based on the results of many recent analyses of individual firmware images, embedded systems acquired a reputation of being insecure. Despite these facts, we still lack a global understanding of embedded systemsâ security as well as the tools and techniques needed to support such general claims.

In this paper we present the first public, large-scale analysis of firmware images. In particular, we unpacked 32 thousand firmware images into 1.7 million individual files, which we then statically analyzed. We leverage this large-scale analysis to bring new insights on the security of embedded devices and to underline and detail several important challenges that need to be addressed in future research. We also show the main benefits of looking at many different devices at the same time and of linking our results with other large-scale datasets such as the ZMapâs HTTPS survey.

In summary, without performing sophisticated static analysis, we discovered a total of 38 previously unknown vulnerabilities in over 693 firmware images. Moreover, by correlating similar files inside apparently unrelated firmware images, we were able to extend some of those vulnerabilities to over 123 different products. We also confirmed that some of these vulnerabilities altogether are affecting at least 140K devices accessible over the Internet. It would not have been possible to achieve these results without an analysis at such wide scale.

We believe that this project, which we plan to provide as a firmware unpacking and analysis web service, will help shed some light on the security of embedded devices.
