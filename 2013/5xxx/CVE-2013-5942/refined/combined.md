# 0.9.11

*8/20/2013*

**NOTE: Graphite 0.9.11 has a regression which breaks cache queries. Please use** [:ref:`0.9.12 <0-9-12>`](#id3) **instead**

Graphite 0.9.11 is now available for usage. Source bundles are available from GitHub:

* <https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/archive/0.9.11.tar.gz>
* <https://github.com/graphite-project/carbon/archive/0.9.11.tar.gz>
* <https://github.com/graphite-project/whisper/archive/0.9.11.tar.gz>

Graphite can also be installed from [Pypi](http://pypi.python.org/) via
[pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html). Pypi bundles are here:

* <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphite-web/>
* <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/carbon/>
* <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/whisper/>

## Upgrading

It's recommended to install all three 0.9.11 packages together for the most success, however in this
case *graphite-web* can be installed separately from carbon if necessary. *Carbon* and *Whisper* must
be updated together due to the coupling of certain changes.

Graphite 0.9.11 now requires a Django version of at least 1.3. Ensure this dependency is satisfied
before updating *graphite-web*

As always, comparing the example config files with existing ones is recommended to ensure
awareness of any new features.

## Security Notes

This release contains several security fixes for cross-site scripting (XSS) as well as a fix for
a remote-execution exploit in graphite-web
([CVE-2013-5093](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2013-5093)).
Patches for the past three prior releases are available in these gists:

* [0.9.10](https://gist.github.com/mleinart/6285953)
* [0.9.9](https://gist.github.com/mleinart/6285975)
* [0.9.8](https://gist.github.com/mleinart/6285983)

In a pinch, the following url mapping can be removed by hand if the remote-rendering feature is
not being used:

```
diff --git a/webapp/graphite/render/urls.py b/webapp/graphite/render/urls.py
index a94a5d1..f934b43 100644
--- a/webapp/graphite/render/urls.py
+++ b/webapp/graphite/render/urls.py
@@ -15,7 +15,6 @@ limitations under the License."""
 from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

 urlpatterns = patterns('graphite.render.views',
-  ('local/?$','renderLocalView'),
   ('~(?P<username>[^/]+)/(?P<graphName>[^/]+)/?','renderMyGraphView'),
   ('', 'renderView'),
 )

```

Finally, The setting of Django's SECRET\_KEY setting is now encouraged and exposed in local\_settings.py as
well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
