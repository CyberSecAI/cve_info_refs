    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-5458",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the XML component of the IBM Java SDK and WebSphere Real Time. It allows code running under a security manager to escalate its privileges by modifying or removing the security manager.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper privilege management",
        "Security manager bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "Code running under a security manager can escalate its privileges, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other unauthorized actions. In the context of Java applets and Web Start applications, this could allow malicious code from untrusted sources to gain elevated privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely when the vulnerable IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition or WebSphere Real Time has been associated with a web browser for running applets and Web Start applications. It could also be exploited if untrusted code is executed under a security manager.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute untrusted Java code within a context where a security manager is in place, or needs to get their code executed within a vulnerable context through an applet or webstart application. This can be achieved by tricking users to visit a malicious web page or by compromising an existing web server."
