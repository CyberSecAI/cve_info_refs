The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities affecting Cisco ASA Software, including CVE-2013-5512.

**CVE-2013-5512: HTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a race condition when the HTTP DPI engine is inspecting HTTP packets. This occurs when either the `spoof-server` parameter option is enabled or when the Cisco ASA Software is configured to inspect and mask the HTTP response including active-x or java-applet in the response body.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Improper handling of a race condition in the HTTP DPI engine.
    *   Vulnerable configurations include enabling the `spoof-server` parameter or using the mask option with active-x or java-applet in the HTTP response body.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a reload of the affected system, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP response through the affected system.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP responses that are inspected by the HTTP DPI engine.
    *   The attacker must be able to send traffic through the affected Cisco ASA device.
    *   The HTTP DPI engine must be enabled with the vulnerable options enabled.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed and transparent firewall mode, and single and multiple context mode.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
*   This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud37992.
*   Workarounds include removing the affected option from the HTTP DPI configuration.
*   Cisco ASA 5505, Cisco ASA 5510, Cisco ASA 5520, Cisco ASA 5540, and Cisco ASA 5550 products are not affected by this vulnerability.
