# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-100 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint Server Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2904244)

Published: December 10, 2013

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves multiple privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office server software. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an authenticated attacker sends specially crafted page content to a SharePoint server. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the security context of the W3WP service account on the target SharePoint site.

This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 and for affected Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps on supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 and Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how SharePoint server sanitizes specially crafted page content. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**Â Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## SharePoint Page Content Vulnerabilities - CVE-2013-5059

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft SharePoint Server. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the security context of the W3WP service account.

To view these vulnerabilities as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-5059](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-5059).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to authenticate on the target SharePoint site. Note that this is not a mitigating factor if the SharePoint site is configured to allow anonymous users to access the site. By default, anonymous access is not enabled.

#### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?**

These are remote code execution vulnerabilities.

**What causes the vulnerabilities?**

When page content is not properly sanitized, conditions exist where an attacker could run arbitrary code in the security context of the W3WP service account.

**Why is a single CVE Identifier assigned to multiple vulnerabilities?**

Although the vulnerabilities are in different components of Microsoft SharePoint Server, they all share the same underlying issue and related code. The vulnerabilities are grouped into a single CVE Identifier that represents the underlying issue.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerabilities** **to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the security context of the W3WP service account on the target SharePoint site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerabilities?**

An authenticated attacker could attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted page content to a SharePoint server.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerabilities?**

Systems that are running an affected version of SharePoint server are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how SharePoint Server sanitizes specially crafted page content.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had these vulnerabilities** **been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about these vulnerabilities through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that these vulnerabilitieswere** **being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

### Update Information

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.

* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) lets administrators scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and common security misconfigurations.
* Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Systems Management Server (SMS), and System Center Configuration Manager help administrators distribute security updates.
* The Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit aid in streamlining the testing and validation of Windows updates against installed applications.

For more information about these tools and guidance in deploying security updates across networks, seeÂ [Security Tools for IT Pros](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc297183).

**Note for SharePoint Server**Â The detection tools (such as Microsoft Update, WSUS, MBSA, SMS, and System Center Configuration Manager) are applicable for single-server Microsoft SharePoint Server deployments. The detection tools do not detect the applicability of the updates on systems configured as part of a multiple-system SharePoint server farm.
