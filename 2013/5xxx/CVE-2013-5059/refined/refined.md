- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of page content by Microsoft SharePoint Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft SharePoint Server, specifically due to how it handles and sanitizes page content.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker to run arbitrary code in the security context of the W3WP service account on the target SharePoint site.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker sends specially crafted page content to a SharePoint server to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated to the SharePoint site. However, if anonymous access is enabled, authentication is not required.
