{
  "CVE-2013-5825": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way the JRE processes XML inputs.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper processing of XML inputs, potentially leading to excessive resource consumption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could supply crafted XML that would cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory, resulting in a denial of service.",
     "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted XML document to a vulnerable application",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted XML document to the vulnerable application."
  },
  "CVE-2013-5823": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A denial of service flaw was discovered in the com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.security.utils.UnsyncByteArrayOutputStream class.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A flaw exists in the way UnsyncByteArrayOutputStream class handles byte streams which can cause a denial of service.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could supply crafted XML that would lead to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted XML document to a vulnerable application",

    "CVE-2013-5774": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Errors were discovered in the Inet6Address class when processing IPv6 addresses.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Inet6Address class contained errors when processing IPv6 addresses, which could lead to inaccurate results.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "This could lead to inaccurate results when processing IPv6 addresses, for example during serialization.",
       "Attack vectors": "An attacker can provide a specially crafted IPv6 address to a vulnerable application",
