Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5882:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `security.gentoo.org` and `oracle.com` both explicitly mention CVE-2013-5882 as a vulnerability affecting MySQL Server. The Oracle document details that it specifically impacts the "Stored Procedure" component. Thus, the content is related to CVE-2013-5882.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the "Stored Procedure" component of MySQL Server. Specific details of the root cause are not available in the provided documents.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - The weakness exists in the way MySQL handles stored procedures. This could relate to insufficient input validation, improper access controls, or flaws in the procedure execution logic but the details of the specific flaw are not specified.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact of the vulnerability is the possibility of a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Exploitation could cause the MySQL server to become unresponsive or crash.
-  The impact is characterized as leading to a complete denial of service (availability is 'complete') as stated in the risk matrix of the oracle advisory.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network using the MySQL protocol.
- The specific attack vector is through execution of a malicious stored procedure or the exploitation of the server while processing a legitimate one.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **MySQL User Account:** An attacker requires a valid MySQL user account with the necessary privileges to execute stored procedures. The oracle document specifies that the attacker needs the ability to create, or otherwise execute, a stored procedure.
-   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network connectivity to the MySQL server.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs an understanding of the vulnerability in order to craft an exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Oracle's Advisory:** The Oracle document provides more specific details, mentioning that the vulnerability is in MySQL Server's "Stored Procedure" component. The risk matrix rates this with an access vector of "Network", an access complexity of "low" and a requirement for "single" authentication. It also lists "None" for Confidentiality and Integrity impact and "Complete" for availability impact.
*  **Gentoo Advisory:** The gentoo advisory confirms this is part of a large set of vulnerabilities fixed in version 5.5.39 and provides that a local attacker could gain escalated privileges as well, but this may be due to a different vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** Oracle uses CVSS v2.0 scores, and while not explicitly provided for CVE-2013-5882, related vulnerabilities in the document have a base score of 6.8

In summary, CVE-2013-5882 is a vulnerability in the stored procedure handling of MySQL Server that can be exploited over the network by an authenticated user, with the potential to cause a denial of service. The Oracle advisory provides more detail on the specific component affected and the impact.
