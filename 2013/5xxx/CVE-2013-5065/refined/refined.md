{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the NDProxy.sys kernel component fails to properly validate input passed from user mode to the kernel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation in the NDProxy kernel component"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, gaining complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation by running a specially crafted application after logging on to the system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the system."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "workarounds": "A workaround involves rerouting the NDProxy service to null.sys, which disables the vulnerable driver and prevents exploitation. However, this also disables services that rely on Telephony Application Programming Interfaces (TAPI), such as Remote Access Service (RAS), dial-up networking, and virtual private networking (VPN).",
    "affected_systems": [
      "Windows XP Service Pack 3",
      "Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2",
      "Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2",
      "Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition Service Pack 2",

    ],
        "publicly_disclosed": true,
       "exploited": true,
      "exploit_availability": "Public exploits are available.",
    "notes": "The vulnerability is present in the NDProxy component, a system-provided driver that interfaces WAN miniport drivers, call managers, and miniport call managers to the Telephony Application Programming Interfaces (TAPI) services."
