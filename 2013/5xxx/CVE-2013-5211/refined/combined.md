openSUSE Security Update: Avoid ntp being used as a DDoS amplifier
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:1149-1
Rating: moderate
References: #857195
Cross-References: CVE-2013-5211
Affected Products:
openSUSE 11.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
restrict query, configuration, modification access from world by default.
Avoids that ntp can be used as a DDoS amplifier. The monlist feature in
ntp\_request.c in ntpd in NTP before 4.2.7p26 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via forged (1)
REQ\_MON\_GETLIST or (2) REQ\_MON\_GETLIST\_1 requests, as exploited in the
wild in December 2013.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 11.4:
zypper in -t patch 2014-84
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".
Package List:
- openSUSE 11.4 (i586 x86\_64):
ntp-4.2.6p3-6.24.1
ntp-debuginfo-4.2.6p3-6.24.1
ntp-debugsource-4.2.6p3-6.24.1

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory <http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin>

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

+ 18 October 2016
+ 17 January 2017
+ 18 April 2017
+ 18 July 2017

# Script `ntp-monlist`

[Script types](/book/nse-script-format.html#nse-format-rules):
portrule

Categories:

Download: <https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/ntp-monlist.nse>

## Script Summary

Obtains and prints an NTP server's monitor data.

Monitor data is a list of the most recently used (MRU) having NTP associations
with the target. Each record contains information about the most recent NTP
packet sent by a host to the target including the source and destination
addresses and the NTP version and mode of the packet. With this information it
is possible to classify associated hosts as Servers, Peers, and Clients.

A Peers command is also sent to the target and the peers list in the response
allows differentiation between configured Mode 1 Peers and clients which act
like Peers (such as the Windows W32Time service).

Associated hosts are further classified as either public or private.
Private hosts are those
having IP addresses which are not routable on the public Internet and thus can
help to form a picture about the topology of the private network on which the
target resides.

Other information revealed by the monlist and peers commands are the host with
which the target clock is synchronized and hosts which send Control Mode (6)
and Private Mode (7) commands to the target and which may be used by admins for
the NTP service.

It should be noted that the very nature of the NTP monitor data means that the
Mode 7 commands sent by this script are recorded by the target (and will often
appear in these results). Since the monitor data is a MRU list, it is probable
that you can overwrite the record of the Mode 7 command by sending an innocuous
looking Client Mode request. This can be achieved easily using Nmap:
`nmap -sU -pU:123 -Pn -n --max-retries=0 <target>`

Notes:

* The monitor list in response to the monlist command is limited to 600 associations.
* The monitor capability may not be enabled on the target in which case you may receive an error number 4 (No Data Available).
* There may be a restriction on who can perform Mode 7 commands (e.g. "restrict noquery" in `ntp.conf`) in which case you may not receive a reply.
* This script does not handle authenticating and targets expecting auth info may respond with error number 3 (Format Error).

## Example Usage

```
nmap -sU -pU:123 -Pn -n --script=ntp-monlist <target>

## action

action (host, port)

Send an NTPv2 Mode 7 'monlist' command to the target, receive any responses
and parse records from those responses. If the target responds favourably
then send a 'peers' command and parse the responses. Finally, categorise the
discovered NTP associations (hosts) and output the interpreted results.

### Parameters

host
port

## portrule

portrule (host, port)

ntp-monlist will run against the ntp service which only runs on UDP 123

### Parameters

host
port

Alert
# NTP Amplification Attacks Using CVE-2013-5211

Last RevisedOctober 06, 2016
Alert CodeTA14-013A

### Systems Affected

NTP servers

### Overview

A Network Time Protocol (NTP) Amplification attack is an emerging form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) that relies on the use of publically accessible NTP servers to overwhelm a victim system with UDP traffic.

The NTP service supports a monitoring service that allows administrators to query the server for traffic counts of connected clients. This information is provided via the “monlist” command. The basic attack technique consists of an attacker sending a "get monlist" request to a vulnerable NTP server, with the source address spoofed to be the victim’s address.

### Impact

The attack relies on the exploitation of the 'monlist' feature of NTP, as described in CVE-2013-5211, which is enabled by default on older NTP-capable devices. This command causes a list of the last 600 IP addresses which connected to the NTP server to be sent to the victim. Due to the spoofed source address, when the NTP server sends the response it is sent instead to the victim. Because the size of the response is typically considerably larger than the request, the attacker is able to amplify the volume of traffic directed at the victim. Additionally, because the responses are legitimate data coming from valid servers, it is especially difficult to block these types of attacks. The solution is to disable “monlist” within the NTP server or to upgrade to the latest version of NTP (4.2.7) which disables the “monlist” functionality.

### Solution

#### **Detection**

On a UNIX-platform, the command “ntpdc” will query existing NTP servers for monitoring data. If the system is vulnerable to exploitation, it will respond to the “monlist” command in interactive mode. By default, most modern UNIX and Linux distributions allow this command to be used from localhost, but not from a remote host. To test for monlist support, execute the following command at the command line:

/usr/sbin/ntpdc <remote server>

monlist

Additionally, the “ntp-monlist” script is available for NMap, which will automatically display the results of the monlist command. If the system does not support the monitor query, and is therefore not vulnerable to this attack type, NMap will return an error type 4 (No Data Available) or no reply at all.

**Recommended Course of Action**

As all versions of ntpd prior to 4.2.7 are vulnerable by default, the simplest recommended course of action is to upgrade all versions of ntpd that are publically accessible to at least 4.2.7. However, in cases where it is not possible to upgrade the version of the service, it is possible to disable the monitor functionality in earlier versions of the software.

To disable “monlist” functionality on a public-facing NTP server that cannot be updated to 4.2.7, add the “noquery” directive to the “restrict default” line in the system’s ntp.conf, as shown below:

restrict default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery

restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery

ICS Advisory
# NTP Reflection Attack

Last RevisedSeptember 06, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-14-051-04

## OVERVIEW

NCCIC/ICS-CERT has been following the increase in denial-of-service (DoS) attacks using Network Time Protocol (NTP) Reflection. This type of attack provides an adversary the ability to generate high volume distributed denial of service (DDoS) traffic to target web sites or public‑facing devices that could cause disruption to services.

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target this type of attack are known to be publicly available.

Mitigations are available for both operators of NTP Stratum devices and possible victims of these attacks.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Products using NTP service NTP-4.2.7p25 and prior (with MONLIST support) are affected. No specific vendor is specified as this is an open source protocol.

## IMPACT

Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause NTP Stratum devices to be used as sources of unrequested NTP synchronization requests in a DoS attack.

Victims of this type of DoS attack could see service interruption due to boundary protection rules do not filter NTP synchronization requests that do not originate internally.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

The NTP is described in RFC 958Network Time Protocol (NTP), http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc958, web site last accessed February 20, 2014., an open source collaboration for acceptance, and is used to synchronize system time over a network.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, web site last accessed February 20, 2014.

The NTP service could allow for multiple sync requests to be made with a forged source IP address, thus sending the unrequested responses back to the source, consuming its resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specifically crafted packet with a forged source IP address of the target.

It will not be evident to the NTP operator that the system has been exploited or is being used in a DoS attack as the commands are normal time synchronization requests.

CVE-2013-5211NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-5211, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. web site last accessed February 20, 2014. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, web site last accessed February 20, 2014.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

Exploits that target this vulnerability are publicly available.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

## MITIGATION

NTP can be upgraded to NTP-4.2.7p26 or later that removes MONLIST support and is replaced with the more secure MRUNLIST function. This fix has been available since 2010.

In addition, integrators and asset owners are encouraged to review boundary protection rule sets and filters to eliminate incoming NTP requests that do not originate internally.

NCCIC/US-CERT resource documents that outline suggestions for mitigating active DDoS attacks are available here:

[http://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DDoS%20Quick%20Guide.pdf](/sites/default/files/publications/DDoS%20Quick%20Guide.pdf)

[http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015](/ncas/tips/ST04-015)

<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/348126>

NCCIC/ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC/ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) NCCIC/ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B—Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC/ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1532#c0)  Dave Hart    2010-04-20 03:33:22 UTC  ``` Once [Bug #1531](show_bug.cgi?id=1531 "VERIFIED FIXED - Require nonce with mrulist requests") is resolved, ntpd's support for ntpdc's monlist operation should be stubbed to return an error.  One reason is the protocol is inherently fragile and not portable, depending on being able to queue many UDP packets received in a burst.  Another is it cannot be secured as ntpq's mrulist can, because backwards compatibility would be broken, at which point there's no reason to maintain it with mrulist providing better access to the same functionality.  On the other hand, ntpdc should retain its monlist implementation for some time so that a newer ntpdc can manage diverse remote ntpd versions before and after the addition of mrulist and removal of monlist. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1532#c1)  Dave Hart    2010-04-22 17:11:44 UTC  ``` This is ready from either of:  pogo:/usa/hart/ntp-dev-1531-32 psp-deb1:/home/hart/ntp-dev-1531-32 ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1532#c2)  Harlan Stenn    2010-04-24 08:27:08 UTC  ``` Dave,  Thanks for your report and work on this.  Please check 4.2.7-p26 and mark this bug as VERIFIED or REOPENED, as appropriate.  Also please note that unless somebody has a Good Reason otherwise, I'd like to see this backported to 4.2.6. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1532#c3)  Dave Hart    2010-05-03 12:11:36 UTC  ``` Backporting this disabling of monlist responses by ntpd to -stable means backporting the new mrulist support in ntpd, and the underlying ntp_monitor.c changes.  After one attempt, I can also now say it requires backporting the new "mru" knobs and their -dev default values.  With the 600 entry hard limit on addresses in -stable, mrulist is severely challenged in its approach of fetching the list in multiple operations starting with the oldest entries.  One common failure in that case was endlessly chasing the too-fast flush through, with ntpq never retrieving entries less than a minute old, ad infinitum.  In the same situation, ntp-dev mrulist does much better with the deeper history kept by ntpd.  This would mean even more behavioral changes in a -stable point release.  Perhaps we should focus on driving ntp-dev towards a new ntp-stable 4.2.8 or 4.3.0 instead of backporting so much of 4.2.7 to 4.2.6. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1532#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2010-05-06 08:57:11 UTC  ``` Dave,  Fair enough - I've removed the 4.2.6 flag for this bug.  Please mark this bug as VERIFIED or REOPENED, for ntp-dev, as appropriate. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1532#c5)  Harlan Stenn    2014-02-20 10:06:22 UTC  ``` This bug was reported against 4.2.6, and it was resolved in 4.2.7p26. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1532#c6)  Ulrich Windl    2016-07-04 08:35:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1532#c5)) > This bug was reported against 4.2.6, and it was resolved in 4.2.7p26.  As per 4.2.8p8 the response "*** Server reports data not found" to ntpdc's monlist query isn't very helpful, specifically as the manual pages are very silent regarding "monlist". Wouldn't a better approach have been to switch the default from "enable monitor" to "disable monitor" (assuming it controls exactly "monlist" as the docs suggest)? Documentation on "enable monitor" and "monlist" in ntpdc's man page are quite vague. At the very list I'd suggest to change the message "*** Server reports data not found" to something like "*** Server doesn't implement monlist any more for security reasons.  Use ntpq's mrulist instead.". ``` |  |

Subject: CVE to the ntp monlist DDoS issue?

There's a recent rash of DDoS involving the monlist functionality
in older ntp.org ntp.  Has anyone thought about assigning a CVE to
this?  It looks like the issue may have been addressed back in 2010,
but only in the context of ntp.org's "dev" tree, not "stable".

## NTP can be abused to amplify denial-of-service attack traffic

#### Vulnerability Note VU#348126

Original Release Date: 2014-01-10 | Last Revised: 2014-08-26

---

### Overview

UDP protocols such as NTP can be abused to amplify denial-of-service attack traffic. Servers running the network time protocol (NTP) based on implementations of ntpd prior to version 4.2.7p26 that use the default unrestricted query configuration are susceptible to a reflected denial-of-service (DRDoS) attack. Other proprietary NTP implementations may also be affected.

### Description

| NTP and other UDP-based protocols can be used to amplify denial-of-service attacks. Servers running the network time protocol (NTP) based on implementations of ntpd prior to version 4.2.7p26 that use the default unrestricted query configuration are susceptible to a reflected denial-of-service (DRDoS) attack. Other proprietary NTP implementations may also be affected. This is similar in scope to [DNS Amplification Attacks](http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A).  In a reflected denial-of-service attack, the attacker spoofs the source address of attack traffic, replacing the source address with the target's address. Certain NTP control messages provide significant bandwidth amplification factors (BAF).NTP is designed for time synchronization, and may also implement other features such as server administration, maintenance, and monitoring. NTP relies on the user datagram protocol (UDP) to send and receive messages, which does not validate the source (IP address) of the sender. The NTP DRDoS attack is similar to the reflective DoS attacks used on open DNS resolvers. The attacker sends a packet with their source address being the IP of a victim. The NTP server replies to this request, but the number of bytes sent in the response is an amplified amount compared to the initial request, resulting in a denial-of-service on the victim. The two highest message types, REQ\_MON\_GETLIST and REQ\_MON\_GETLIST\_1 amplify the original request by a factor of up to 3660 and 5500 respectively. This bandwidth amplification factor (BAF) is a bandwidth multiplier based on the number of UDP payload bytes that are sent by the server in comparison to the UDP payload bytes of the request. Other message types can also be used in this attack, but REQ\_MON\_GETLIST and REQ\_MON\_GETLIST\_1 create the biggest impact.This vulnerability contains elements of [CWE-406](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/406.html): Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification).More information can be found in Christian Rossow's "[Amplification DDoS Attacks (Ab)using NTP Servers](http://christian-rossow.de/articles/Amplification_DDoS.php)" blog post.In April 2014, Rapid7 published [R7-2014-12](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2014/08/25/r7-2014-12-more-amplification-vulnerabilities-in-ntp-allow-even-more-drdos-attacks) documenting additional NTP commands that can amplify traffic and disclose potentially sensitive information. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker may leverage the vulnerable NTP server to conduct a distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS) attack on another user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Affected users are advised to update to [ntpd versions 4.2.7p26 and greater](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). ntpd version 4.2.7p26 disables REQ\_MON\_GETLIST and REQ\_MON\_GETLIST\_1, removing the two most significant BAF control messages.The 4.2.6.x and earlier production branches are still vulnerable to this attack, however.If an update is not possible, please consider one or more of the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Check if the amplified responses are enabled**Entering the following commands can help users verify if the REQ\_MON\_GETLIST and REQ\_MON\_GETLIST\_1 responses of NTP are currently enabled:ntpq -c rvntpdc -c sysinfontpdc -n -c monlistThese commands only verify if the specified functions are enabled. If they are enabled, implement at least one of the following:**Perform Egress Filtering**Configure your router/firewall to perform egress filtering, which may help to mitigate attacks that utilize source IP spoofing. Please refer to your product's documentation for instructions on how to perform egress filtering.**Disable status queries or restrict access.**The ntpd status query features provided by ntpq/ntpdc will reveal some information about the system running ntpd (e.g. OS version, ntpd version) that you may not wish others to know. Disabling this feature may also help to reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability taking place. If the NTP implementation is vulnerable, adding the following lines to your ntp.conf file will restrict informational queries to authorized recipients only.IPV4: restrict default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noqueryIPv6: restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noqueryPlease note that a restart of the ntpd service is required for changes to take effect.It is also possible to restrict access per network segment (be sure to modify line 3 to match your LAN settings) and per host (line 4):restrict default noqueryrestrict localhostrestrict 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0restrict 192.168.1.27Please note that a restart of the ntpd service is required for changes to take effect. Please also note that the ntpq/ntpdc query capabilities provide useful Q/A and debugging information. Disabling these queries comes with a cost. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
