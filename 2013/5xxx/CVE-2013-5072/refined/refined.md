Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Exchange Server not properly sanitizing URLs, which allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a stored or reflected XSS vulnerability in Outlook Web Access (OWA). This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious script into a user's session with the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the context of the current user.
- **Unauthorized Content Access:** Attackers can read content they are not authorized to view.
- **Impersonation:** Attackers can use the victim's identity to perform actions on the OWA site on their behalf (e.g., change permissions, delete content).
- **Malicious Content Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious content into the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attack:** An attacker sends an email message with a specially crafted URL to the targeted OWA site. The user must click on this URL for the attack to succeed.
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker hosts a website that contains a malicious URL. The user would have to be tricked into visiting this website and then clicking on the malicious URL. Compromised or user-content hosting websites could also be used to host this malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that targets the OWA site.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to click on the crafted link.
- The attacker can be remote (e.g., sending phishing emails).

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
- Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
- The provided document explicitly thanks Minded Security, on behalf of Criteo, for reporting this vulnerability.
