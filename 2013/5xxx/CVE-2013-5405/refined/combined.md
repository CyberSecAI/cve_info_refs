# Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities found in IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway (CVE-2013-4002, CVE-2013-5409, CVE-2013-5405, CVE-2013-5406, CVE-2013-5407, CVE-2013-5411, CVE-2013-5413)

### Flashes (Alerts)

## Abstract

IBM Sterling B2B Integrator 5.2 and IBM Sterling File Gateway 2.2 are affected by multiple security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include:

## Content

**VULNERABILITY DETAILS****:**

**CVEID:** [CVE-2013-4002](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4002)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack, triggered by malformed XML data. The malformed data causes the XML parser to consume CPU resource for several minutes before the data is eventually rejected.

CVSS Base Score: 7.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/85260> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2013-5409](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5409)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway are vulnerable to SQL Injection. An authenticated remote attacker could send specially-crafted SQL statements to various screens, which could allow the attacker to view, add, modify or delete information in the back-end database.

CVSS Base Score: 6.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/87358> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2013-5405](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5405)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting attacks. The remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code in various parameters which could lead to unauthorized access through the injected code.

CVSS Base Score: 3.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/87354> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2013-5406](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5406)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway are vulnerable to Windows MHTML Cross-Site Scripting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code in request parameters, which could lead to unauthorized access through the injected code.

CVSS Base Score: 3.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/87355> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2013-5407](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5407)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway are vulnerable to Frame Injection. A remote attacker can initiate a phishing through frames attack by inserting a malicious frame that may be used to gain unauthorized access or collect sensitive information.

CVSS Base Score: 3.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/87356> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2013-5411](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5411)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway are vulnerable to Link Injection. A remote attacker can embed links (URL) to an external site or to different pages. The links can appear to be valid application links while causing the user to navigate to unintended sites or execute unintended actions within the application.

CVSS Base Score: 3.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/87360> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2013-5413](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5413)

**DESCRIPTION:** Logging out of the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway applications does not invalidate current session values. This could lead to other users employing those identifiers to impersonate that user and perform actions on their behalf.

CVSS Base Score: 1.9

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/87362> for the current score
