{
  "CVE-2013-5745": {
    "Description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way Vino handled certain authenticated requests from clients that were in the deferred state. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make the vino-server process enter an infinite loop when processing those incoming requests.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is triggered when a VNC client sends malformed data during the authentication selection stage. The server closes the client connection on receiving an unexpected input sequence, but the unprocessed client data remains in the buffer. The server does not remove it from the buffer since the client connection has been closed. This leads to an infinite loop when the server tries to process data on the closed socket.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of client data after connection closure.",
       "Lack of input validation during the authentication process.",
      "No rate limiting on processing client messages."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service. The vino-server process enters an infinite loop, consuming 100% CPU. The server becomes unresponsive to new client connection requests. The log file grows rapidly consuming disk space.",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "Remote attacker sends malformed data during the VNC authentication process."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable VNC server, specifically malformed data during the authentication selection stage."
