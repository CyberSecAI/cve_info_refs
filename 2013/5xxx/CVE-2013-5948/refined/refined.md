The provided content relates to CVE-2013-5948.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The ASUS RT-AC68U router's web management interface fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing system commands in the Network Analysis tab. Specifically, the application concatenates user input from the `destIP` field into a system command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection:  The primary vulnerability is command injection via the `destIP` parameter when using ping, traceroute, or nslookup tools. By injecting shell metacharacters (like `;`) followed by another command, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's underlying operating system.
- Improper Input Validation:  The web interface does not properly sanitize input, specifically the target address, which allows injection of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Command Execution: A logged-in user can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
- Privilege Escalation: While the attacker needs to be logged in, the vulnerability allows for executing commands, potentially with elevated privileges depending on the context of the webserver.
- Data exfiltration: With arbitrary command execution, an attacker can potentially access sensitive data such as `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web interface: The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface in the "Network Analysis" tab of the ASUS RT-AC68U.
- HTTP GET Request:  The attacker crafts a malicious GET request to the `/apply.cgi` endpoint, including malicious commands within the `destIP` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.
- Authentication: The attacker must be authenticated to the router's web interface.
