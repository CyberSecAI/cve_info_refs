This document describes multiple vulnerabilities in Coursemill Learning Management System versions 6.6 and 6.8. CVE-2013-5707 is not mentioned, but there are seven related CVEs listed.

**CVE-2013-3599:**
*   **Root cause:** External control of assumed-immutable web parameter.
*   **Weakness:** The user role is returned as a parameter in the response to `userlogin.jsp` and is passed to the client for processing.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation without authentication is possible in version 6.8.
*   **Attack vector:** Manipulating the user role parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** No authentication required.

**CVE-2013-3600:**
*   **Root cause:** External control of assumed-immutable web parameter.
*   **Weakness:** The `userid` parameter is exploitable in certain functions, such as "Edit Profile".
*   **Impact:** Access to another user's (or privileged user's) information.
*  **Attack vector:** Replaying modified requests.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires an account with the ability to edit their profile.

**CVE-2013-3601:**
*   **Root cause:** Execution with unnecessary privileges.
*   **Weakness:** User-executed functions rely on JavaServer Pages (JSP) and an "op" parameter that determines the operation to run. Non-administrative users can execute functions that should be restricted to administrators.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a request with an "op" parameter that executes restricted functions.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires an account with non-administrative student role.

**CVE-2013-3602:**
*   **Root cause:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a SQL command ('SQL Injection').
*   **Weakness:** The `docID` parameter in `admindocumentworker.jsp` is used directly in SQL queries, allowing for SQL injection.
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary database access/manipulation.
*   **Attack vector:** Modifying the `docID` parameter to inject SQL code.
*   **Attacker capabilities:**  Requires a valid session with the application.

**CVE-2013-3603:**
*   **Root cause:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
*   **Weakness:** Error messages containing user-provided URL input are reflected directly to the browser without proper input validation or output encoding. The application attempts to remove event attributes by keyword, but this filter can be bypassed using null bytes.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to send the crafted URL to a victim user.

**CVE-2013-3604:**
*   **Root cause:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
*   **Weakness:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to insufficient input filtering, specifically regarding the use of double quotes which the application does not filter properly.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
*   **Attack vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript into application inputs.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to add content to application inputs.

**CVE-2013-3605:**
*   **Root cause:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
*   **Weakness:** The application relies on cookie values for authentication, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. The CSRF tokens added in version 6.8 use predictable timestamps.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack vector:** Crafting a malicious web page that performs actions on the target application when loaded by an authenticated user.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to trick an authenticated user into loading a malicious page.
