Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2013-5151:

**CVE-2013-5151**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from Mobile Safari incorrectly handling files, treating them as HTML even when the server specifies a `Content-Type: text/plain` header.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is a lack of proper content type enforcement, allowing files intended to be treated as plain text to be parsed as HTML, which can lead to script execution.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that permit users to upload files. Attackers could potentially inject malicious scripts, which would then execute within the context of the vulnerable website when a user accesses the file via Mobile Safari.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves a user visiting a website via Mobile Safari, and the website serves a file with `Content-Type: text/plain`. If Mobile Safari fails to honor this header, the browser may interpret the file as HTML. If the file contains malicious script, it can execute within the context of the website, achieving XSS.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker needs to host or be able to inject a file on a website which is vulnerable to this issue. A user must then visit the site and attempt to access the malicious file using Mobile Safari.

This vulnerability is specific to Mobile Safari and affects systems running iOS 7.
