- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `search[gender]` and `search[sort_by]` parameters before being used in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the mentioned parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data, manipulate the database, or cause denial of service by injecting arbitrary SQL queries. Specifically, the `search[sort_by]` parameter allows sorting results based on attacker-controlled criteria, potentially exposing more data.
- **Attack vectors:**  HTTP POST requests to `/user/browse/view_/` with specially crafted `search[gender]` and `search[sort_by]` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is mentioned to be required for the exploit.
