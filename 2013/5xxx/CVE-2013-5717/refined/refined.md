- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malformed Bluetooth HCI ACL packet can cause a crash in the Wireshark dissector.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Bluetooth HCI ACL dissector has a vulnerability that can be triggered by a malformed packet.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to a crash of the Wireshark application.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can either inject a malformed packet onto the network or trick a user into opening a malicious packet trace file containing the malformed packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to either inject malformed packets into the network that Wireshark is analyzing or be able to provide a malformed pcap file to the user for analysis.
