Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5406:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Windows MHTML Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw specific to how the application handles MHTML (MIME HTML) content. This allows for the injection of malicious code within the request parameters of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject malicious code, potentially leading to unauthorized access. This could enable the attacker to perform actions within the application context of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
A remote attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious code and inserting it into request parameters. The specific method is by exploiting the way the application parses and renders MHTML content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable application (i.e. network access).
- The attacker must have some level of access to the application, although the provided CVSS vector (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N) indicates that the attacker needs to be authenticated (Au:S). However, there's a chance that this vulnerability can be triggered without authentication.

**Summary:**
CVE-2013-5406 describes a Windows MHTML Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability that affects IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious code into request parameters, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
