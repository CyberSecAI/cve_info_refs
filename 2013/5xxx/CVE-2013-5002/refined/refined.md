Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by unescaped HTML output in the schema export feature of phpMyAdmin. When calling `schema_export.php` with crafted parameters, it results in a self-XSS.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue due to the lack of proper output sanitization or encoding of user-supplied parameters within `schema_export.php`. This aligns with CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) and CWE-661 (Incorrect Behavior Order).

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is described as "self-XSS". This means the attacker can only trigger the vulnerability on their own session. While not as severe as a stored or reflected XSS that can affect other users, it could still be used to perform malicious actions within the context of the victim's phpMyAdmin session such as performing unintended actions.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious parameters when calling `schema_export.php`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be logged into phpMyAdmin to exploit this vulnerability, which means they need to have valid user credentials. The application's token protection mechanisms prevent unauthenticated users from accessing the vulnerable form, requiring the attacker to be an authorized user on the system.
