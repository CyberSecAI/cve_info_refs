Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the insecure implementation of the 'system check' functionality in the D-Link DSR series routers' web interface. Specifically, user-supplied input to the ping, traceroute, and dnslookup functionalities is directly passed to the underlying operating system via `io.popen` or `os.execute` without proper sanitization or validation, resulting in command injection.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Command Injection: The web interface allows arbitrary command execution via the `ping`, `traceroute`, and `dnslookup` utilities in the System Check page. User-provided input is directly included in shell commands that are executed on the system.

Impact of exploitation:
- Privilege Escalation:  An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the router's operating system.
- Full system compromise: Complete control over the vulnerable D-Link device and all its connected resources.

Attack vectors:
- Web Interface:  The vulnerability is accessible through the router's web interface, specifically the "Tools --> System Check" page.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface on ports 443 or 80 to reach the vulnerable system check page.
- No authentication needed: No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability due to a related authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2013-5945). The attacker can bypass login or use the SQL injection to log in and then access the vulnerable system check page.
- Javascript checks bypass: The attacker would need to bypass some javascript client-side validation, easily bypassed by tools or using curl
