The provided content is related to CVE-2013-5001.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from improper escaping of object names when using the TextLinkTransformationPlugin to create links. Specifically, when displaying table contents, the object name is not properly sanitized before being used in the link, allowing for injection of malicious code if the object name is crafted with malicious content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application when an administrator views a table containing a crafted object name. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafting a malicious object name within the database. When phpMyAdmin attempts to display the table with a TextLinkTransformationPlugin active, the improperly sanitized object name is rendered as a link allowing the XSS payload to trigger.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to create or modify a database object with a crafted name and also be logged into phpMyAdmin to trigger the vulnerability. Non-logged-in users are protected by token based authentication.
