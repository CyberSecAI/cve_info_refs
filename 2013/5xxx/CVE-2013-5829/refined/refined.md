Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-5829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the Java2D Disposer component of OpenJDK. It was found that the disposer does not properly dispose of resources if an exception occurs during the process, leading to a security bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Resource Disposal:**  The Java2D Disposer component fails to properly deallocate resources when an exception occurs during disposal, leading to a resource leak and potentially a security bypass.
-   **Missing Permission Check:** A permission check was missing in the `RMIConnection` stub built as part of the JDK.
-   **Bypass of Java Sandbox Restrictions:** The primary vulnerability is the possibility of bypassing the Java sandbox restrictions due to the improper resource handling, as well as other vulnerabilities in other parts of the Java runtime.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Bypass of Java Sandbox:** An untrusted Java application or applet could bypass Java sandbox restrictions by exploiting these vulnerabilities.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the Java Virtual Machine.
-  **Disclosure of Memory**: Untrusted Java applications could disclose portions of the Java Virtual Machine memory due to flaws in image conversions.
-  **Denial of Service:** Crafted XML files could lead to excessive CPU and memory usage when processed, leading to Denial of Service.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Untrusted Java Applets/Applications:** A malicious applet or application could be designed to exploit the improper resource handling and other mentioned vulnerabilities in the Java runtime.
-   **Remote Network Exploitation:**  The vulnerabilities can be triggered over a network by exploiting the RMI (Remote Method Invocation), XML, JNDI, and other affected components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Untrusted Code Execution:** Attackers need to run untrusted Java code on a target system. This could be achieved by hosting malicious applets on a web server, luring users to visit, or by tricking a user into running an application.
-   **Network Access (Potentially):**  Some of the vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely over the network and require network access to the target, while others can be exploited from a user's machine if the malicious code is executed locally.

**Additional Information**

The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was addressed in:
- Oracle Java SE 7u45 and 6u65, IcedTea7 2.4.3, and IcedTea6 1.11.14 and 1.12.7.
- Red Hat errata include RHSA-2013:1440, RHSA-2013:1447, RHSA-2013:1451, RHSA-2013:1505, RHSA-2013:1507, RHSA-2013:1508, RHSA-2013:1509, and RHSA-2014:0414 address this issue, along with others in the same timeframe.

The vulnerability affects multiple components within the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Development Kit (JDK).
Specifically, the vulnerability is present in the CORBA component, the 2D graphics library, JNDI, and the Libraries component of OpenJDK and Oracle Java.
An attacker could create a malicious applet or application that uses these components to bypass security restrictions, disclose memory, or cause denial of service.
