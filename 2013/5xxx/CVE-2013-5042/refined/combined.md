## Update FAQ

**What is** **ASP.NET SignalR?**

ASP.NET SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that simplifies the development of real-time web functionality. ASP.NET SignalR allows bi-directional communication between server and client via JavaScript, enabling servers to push content to connected clients instantly as it becomes available (push functionality). For more information about ASP.NET SignalR, see [Learn About ASP.NET SignalR](https://www.asp.net/signalr).

**How do I determine which versions** **of** **ASP.NET SignalRare** **installed on my** **system?**

To determine the versions of ASP.NET SignalR that are deployed on your system, perform a search of the system hard drive for "SignalR". View the properties for any Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core.dll files that are returned in the search to reveal their version numbers. Any 1.1.x versions earlier than version 1.1.4 are vulnerable and should be updated. Any 2.0.x versions earlier than version 2.0.1 are vulnerable and should be updated. Any 1.0.x versions found are not vulnerable.

**How do I upgrade my version of ASP.NET SignalR?**

Instances of ASP.NET SignalR that were installed with Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2013 will be updated via Microsoft Update. However, other instances of ASP.NET SignalR residing on developer systems and web application servers, will need to be updated using processes defined in the **Security Update** **Deployment** Section of this bulletin.

**Will this update upgrade my version of ASP.NET SignalR?**

No. The update will update the patch version installed on a system, but will not upgrade the major or minor version. As of the release of this bulletin, two major versions of ASP.NET SignalR are supported (versions 1.1.x and 2.0.x). The update will update any 1.1.x versions to 1.1.4 and any 2.0.x versions to 2.0.1.

**I am using an older** **release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

#### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **For Windows servers that host web applications** **using** **ASP.NET SignalR functionality,** **turning off the ASP.NET SignalR** **Forever Frame** **transport** **protocol** **provides** **temporary protection from the vulnerability.**

  Disabling the ASP.NET SignalR Forever Frame transport protocol on the client and server sides is accomplished in code. Consult the following examples as guidance for disabling the protocol in your environment.

  Code example to disable the affected transport from the client side:

  ```
  // If using the default hub connection
  $.connection.hub.start({ transport: ["webSockets", "serverSentEvents", "longPolling"] });

  // If using a manually-created connection
  var connection = $.connection("https://sample.com/signalr");
  connection.start({ transport: ["webSockets", "serverSentEvents", "longPolling"] });

  ```

  Code example to disable the affected transport on the server side when using the default global dependency resolver:

  ```
  using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR;
  using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Transports;
  using Owin;
  namespace MyApplication
  {
      public static class Startup
      {
          public static void ConfigureSignalR(IAppBuilder app)
          {
              // If using the global dependency resolver
              TurnOfForeverFrame(GlobalHost.DependencyResolver);
              app.MapSignalR();
          }
          public static void TurnOfForeverFrame(IDependencyResolver resolver)
          {
              var transportManager = resolver.Resolve<itransportmanager>() as TransportManager;
              transportManager.Remove("foreverFrame");
          }
      }
  }

  ```
  ```
  Code example to disable the affected transport on the server side when using a custom dependency resolver:

  using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR;
  using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Transports;
  using Owin;
  namespace MyApplication
  {
      public static class Startup
      {
          public static void ConfigureSignalR(IAppBuilder app)
          {
              // If using a custom dependency resolver
              var resolver = GetCustomResolver();
              TurnOfForeverFrame(resolver);
              app.MapSignalR(new HubConfiguration
              {
                  Resolver = resolver
              });
          }
          private static IDependencyResolver GetCustomResolver()
          {
              return new DefaultDependencyResolver();
          }
          public static void TurnOfForeverFrame(IDependencyResolver resolver)
          {
              var transportManager = resolver.Resolve</itransportmanager><itransportmanager>() as TransportManager;
              transportManager.Remove("foreverFrame");
          }
      }
  }

  ```

  **Impact of the workaround.** After implementing the workaround Internet Explorer clients may exhibit slower communication speed to the SignalR application.
* **For systems with Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2013 installed, Microsoft has not identified any workarounds.**

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
