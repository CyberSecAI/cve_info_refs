Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2013-5042 - SignalR XSS Vulnerability

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by ASP.NET SignalR improperly encoding user input.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-site scripting (XSS). Specifically, user-provided input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a user's browser. This could allow them to:
    *   Modify page content.
    *   Conduct phishing attacks.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the targeted user, potentially gaining access to resources the user has access to.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker injects specially crafted JavaScript into a website using ASP.NET SignalR. When a targeted user visits the site, the malicious JavaScript is reflected back to their browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to introduce the malicious script into the web application. This usually involves exploiting some other vulnerability in the web application that allows an attacker to inject the malicious javascript that then gets reflected back to the user.
    *   The targeted user must visit the compromised website while logged into a context where they have access to sensitive resources.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Software:**
    *   ASP.NET SignalR versions 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, and 2.0.0.
    *   Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2013.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   The primary fix is to update ASP.NET SignalR to versions 1.1.4 or 2.0.1, which includes proper input encoding.
    *   A temporary workaround is available to disable the "Forever Frame" transport protocol in SignalR. This workaround may result in slower communication speeds for Internet Explorer clients but protects against the XSS attack.
*   **Exploitability Index:** The exploitability index is not mentioned in the provided context for this vulnerability. However, the general explanation of the index is provided in the second document, indicating that an index of '0' implies that exploitation has been detected, '1' means exploitation is more likely, '2' indicates exploitation is less likely, and '3' means exploitation is unlikely.
