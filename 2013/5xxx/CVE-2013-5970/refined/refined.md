- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the `hostd-vmdb` service of VMware ESXi and ESX.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to how the `hostd-vmdb` service handles management traffic, allowing for modification if intercepted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) of the `hostd-vmdb` service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must intercept and modify management traffic to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify network traffic on the management network where vSphere components are deployed. The advisory recommends deploying vSphere components on an isolated management network to reduce the likelihood of exploitation.
