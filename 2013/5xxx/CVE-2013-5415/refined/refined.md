- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Buffer overflow in IBM Rational ClearCase.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow and privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential for privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be through network or local access to the Rational ClearCase system due to the nature of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would likely need to be able to send malicious data to the affected ClearCase system or manipulate specific input that is processed in a vulnerable way.
