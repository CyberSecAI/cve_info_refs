Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how EC-CUBE handles the output of error logs. Specifically, the `displaySystemError` function in `/html/handle_error.php` was not properly configured to prevent sensitive information from being exposed in error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure. The error handling mechanism was improperly configured, potentially exposing sensitive data managed by the website owner.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Implied:** Although not explicitly stated, the provided patch modifies the `handle_error.php` file to disable the display of errors, which suggests that errors could potentially be used to inject malicious scripts. The vendor also mentions a "Cross-site scripting and session information disclosure vulnerability"

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker (a user visiting the shopping site) could potentially gain access to information managed by the website owner. This could include sensitive data such as customer information, order details, or other internal data.
- The XSS vulnerability could lead to the execution of malicious scripts within the context of a user's session, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the internet by sending specially crafted requests that trigger an error condition leading to information disclosure.
- The XSS vulnerability can be triggered by inducing an error, where the error message will contain attacker controlled data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any action from a legitimate user.
- **Moderate Technical Expertise:** The attacker needs some technical knowledge to identify and exploit the error handling vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vendor's page mentions a "Cross-site scripting and session information disclosure vulnerability", which clarifies that there are other security issues at play than just the information disclosure from error messages. The vendor patch disables error displaying, implying that the content of those errors was the source of the vulnerability.
- The fix involves adding `ini_set('display_errors','0');` to the `displaySystemError` function, which indicates the error messages were displaying sensitive data.
- The vulnerability affects EC-CUBE versions 2.11.0 to 2.11.5.
- CVSS v2 score of 4.3 (Medium) with vector string: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N
