Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-5094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the application failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `cert_cn` parameter within the `index.exp` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is susceptible to XSS attacks because it doesn't sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary script code within a user's browser.
- This could lead to compromising the application, gaining access to or modifying data, or exploiting other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted request with malicious code in the `cert_cn` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details from the blog post:**
- The blog post provides an example of a crafted HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability:
    ```
    GET /index.exp HTTP/1.1
    Cookie: identity=p805oa53c0dab5vpcv1da30me7; cert_cn='%27%22%28%29%26%251%3CScRiPt %3Eprompt%28920847%29%3C%2FScRiPt%3E; remember=remember
    Host: 172.28.1.1
    Connection: Keep-alive
    Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0)
    Accept: */*
    ```
    This request injects a JavaScript alert box using the `cert_cn` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Tenable plugin description mentions that no exploit is required and Nessus can exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was patched by the vendor on March 15, 2013, and the vulnerability was published on March 8, 2013.
