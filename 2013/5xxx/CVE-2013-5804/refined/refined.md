## Analyzing Content for CVE-2013-5804

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the information related to CVE-2013-5804:

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in `javac` (the Java compiler), where it does not properly ignore certain ignorable characters in Javadoc comments.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
The weakness lies in the inadequate sanitization of input during the processing of Javadoc comments. Specifically, the `javac` tool fails to ignore certain characters which should be treated as ignorable, thus allowing them to be processed and potentially misinterpreted.

### Impact of exploitation
An attacker could inject malicious code by providing specially crafted input that isn't correctly sanitized during the generation of Javadoc API documentation. This can result in:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Influence the integrity and confidentiality of a system where this documentation is hosted.
-  Arbitrary code execution in the context of a user viewing the documentation.

### Attack vectors
The attack vector involves injecting malicious content within Java source code comments. This content is processed by the `javac` tool, and when the Javadoc documentation is generated, it includes the malicious content. The attack is successful when the generated Javadoc documentation is hosted on a domain that is not controlled by the source code author (i.e., a third party, potentially the attacker).

### Required attacker capabilities/position
The attacker needs the ability to influence the content of the Javadoc comments during code compilation. More specifically:
- The attacker needs to have control over the java source code, particularly the comments.
- The attacker does not need to have control over the web server that is hosting the generated documentation, as this is where the vulnerability is exploited
- The attacker should be aware of the vulnerability within javadoc.

### Additional Information

- The vulnerability is related to javadoc's HTML generation. The java compiler (javac) does not ignore some specific ignorable characters when processing the javadoc comments, allowing them to be passed on to the generated output, which is used to generate the javadoc documentation, thus leading to potential XSS issues.
- The vulnerability is relevant to uses where javadoc is used to generate documentation for untrusted source code, and have that documentation hosted on a domain not controlled by the source code author/attacker.
- The issue is fixed in OpenJDK 7u45 and 6u65.

```
## Summary of CVE-2013-5804

- **Root cause:**  `javac` does not ignore certain ignorable characters in Javadoc comments
- **Weaknesses:** Inadequate input sanitization during Javadoc comment processing.
