{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web interface of the Yealink VoIP Phone SIP-T38G allows arbitrary file inclusion due to a vulnerability in handling the 'page' parameter in cgiServer.exx.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input for the 'page' parameter, allowing directory traversal.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files on the device, such as /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. This could lead to privilege escalation, as the cgiServer.exx process runs with root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface. The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to cgiServer.exx containing the vulnerable 'page' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable VoIP phone's web interface."
