| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Successful exploitation could render critical services on the affected device unable to allocate packets resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR Software version 4.3.1 installed on any supported hardware device.      If a UDP listening service is enabled on the device, it is vulnerable. Typical configurations that use UDP services (and their default UDP port numbers) are as follows:   + Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) - UDP Ports 161 and 162   + Network Time Protocol (NTP) - UDP port 123   + Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) - UDP port 646   + Syslog - UDP port 514To determine potential features configured on the Cisco IOS XR device that use UDP as a transport mechanism, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show udp brief** command-line interface (CLI) command. The local address port numbers are important. The local address port numbers are indicated by the final set of numbers in the Local Address column. For example :::123 and 0.0.0.0:123 specify the NTP feature. The following example shows a vulnerable device configured, with NTP, SNMP, Syslog and LDP:    ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:example#show udp briefTue Aug 27 08:57:56.255 PST   PCB     VRF-ID     Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address0x500f87c4 0x60000000      0      0  :::123                 :::0                  0x500f9af8 0x00000000      0      0  :::123                 :::0                  0x500fc28c 0x60000000      0      0  :::161                 :::0                  0x500fc074 0x00000000      0      0  :::161                 :::0                  0x500fc88c 0x60000000      0      0  :::162                 :::0                  0x500fc5fc 0x00000000      0      0  :::162                 :::0                  0x500f8404 0x60000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:514            0.0.0.0:0             0x500fa4d8 0x60000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:123            0.0.0.0:0             0x500fa338 0x00000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:123            0.0.0.0:0             0x500fce3c 0x60000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:646            0.0.0.0:0             0x500f9c98 0x60000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:161            0.0.0.0:0             0x500fb360 0x00000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:161            0.0.0.0:0             0x500fbbbc 0x60000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:162            0.0.0.0:0             0x500fa184 0x00000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:162            0.0.0.0:0             0x500f8f10 0x00000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:0              0.0.0.0:0             RP/0/0/CPU0:example#   ``` To determine the version of Cisco IOS XR Software installed on a Cisco device, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco IOS XR Software". The software version is displayed after the text "Cisco IOS XR Software".      The following example identifies a Cisco 12000 series device with Cisco IOS XR Software version 4.3.1 installed: ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:example#show version briefTue Aug 27 09:07:39.614 PSTCisco IOS XR Software, Version 4.3.1[Default]Copyright (c) 2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.ROM: System Bootstrap, Version 12.00(20090302:133850) [rtauro-sw30346-33S 1.23dev(0.36)] DEVELOPMENT SOFTWARECopyright (c) 1994-2009 by cisco Systems,  Inc.   ``` Additional information about Cisco IOS XR Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html#9).      Additional information about Cisco IOS XR Software time-based release model is available in [White Paper: Guidelines for Cisco IOS XR Software](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps8803/ps5845/product_bulletin_c25-478699.html).   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * **Cisco IOS XR Software Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability.**   A vulnerability in the UDP process of Cisco IOS XR Software version 4.3.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the UDP process to consume all available packet memory.      The vulnerability is due to the failure of the device to release memory of allocated UDP packets when the packet queues are full. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by potentially sending traffic to listening UDP services on the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust all available memory, causing the device to be unable to allocate memory for packets sent to it.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCue69413](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue69413) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5503.      This vulnerability is triggered under certain conditions with either normal or malformed traffic directed at listening UDP services on the affected device. Transit traffic will not trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be exploited using either IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6) traffic.      The device will issue a warning message when the vulnerability is being exploited: ```      ```   %PKT_INFRA-PAKWATCH-4-DEPLETION_WARNING : Depletion level  percent for resource PAK FSV   ```      ``` Administrators are advised to log into the device and issue the CLI command **show packet-memory summary**. If the output indicates the UDP process is holding most of the memory (as indicated by the percentage column) this could be an indication that the device is being exploited by the vulnerability described in this advisory. The following example depicts a device that has been exploited:   ```         RP/0/0/CPU0:example#show packet-memory summary         Wed Aug 28 07:53:21.667 PST          ProcId   JobId Count  Percentage Process         739020993     403 17992     100.00% pkg/bin/udp         RP/0/0/CPU0:example#   ```  Workarounds  * Infrastructure Access Control Lists and Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding **Warning:** Because this vulnerability is exploited via UDP transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. In addition to ACLs, administrators should enable uRPF, a security feature of Cisco IOS Software that verifies the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. The combination of these two technologies offers a stronger mitigation than iACLs alone.      Although it is often difficult to block traffic that transits a network, it is possible to identify traffic that should never be allowed to target infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of networks. Infrastructure ACLs (iACLs) are a network security best practice and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability.       The iACL example below shows how to identify listening UDP services on the device and an appropriate iACL which should be included as part of the deployed infrastructure access-list. This will help protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP address range:  ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:example#show udp brief   Tue Aug 27 08:57:56.255 PST      PCB     VRF-ID     Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address   0x500f87c4 0x60000000      0      0  :::123                 :::0                     0x500f9af8 0x00000000      0      0  :::123                 :::0                     0x500fc28c 0x60000000      0      0  :::161                 :::0                     0x500fc074 0x00000000      0      0  :::161                 :::0                     0x500fc88c 0x60000000      0      0  :::162                 :::0                     0x500fc5fc 0x00000000      0      0  :::162                 :::0                     0x500f8404 0x60000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:514            0.0.0.0:0                0x500fa4d8 0x60000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:123            0.0.0.0:0                0x500fa338 0x00000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:123            0.0.0.0:0                0x500fce3c 0x60000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:646            0.0.0.0:0                0x500f9c98 0x60000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:161            0.0.0.0:0                0x500fb360 0x00000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:161            0.0.0.0:0                0x500fbbbc 0x60000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:162            0.0.0.0:0                0x500fa184 0x00000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:162            0.0.0.0:0                0x500f8f10 0x00000000      0      0  0.0.0.0:0              0.0.0.0:0        RP/0/0/CPU0:example#   RP/0/0/CPU0:example#configure term   ipv4 access-list ACL-INFRASTRUCTURE-IN    !    !

The white paper entitled [Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS XR Devices](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/CiscoIOSXR.html#19), presents guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for infrastructure protection access lists. Identification and RecoveryIf an administrator suspects a device is being exploited, the following these steps will assist in recovery:   1. Determine whether the packet memory is consumed by UDP process by using the **show packet-memory summary** command:   ```         RP/0/0/CPU0:example#show packet-memory summary         Wed Aug 28 07:53:21.667 PST          ProcId   JobId Count  Percentage Process         739020993     405 17992     100.00% pkg/bin/udp         RP/0/0/CPU0:example#   ```   3. Try to identify the incoming traffic input interface using the **show packet-memory inuse** command.   The following example identifies the incoming interface as FastEthernet 0/1/0/4    (Match UDP process Job Id number and looking for high interface counts):    ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:example#show packet-memory inuseWed Aug 28 07:58:16.556 PSTDisplay inuse packets:Pakhandle   Job Id Ifinput      Ifoutput     dll/pc      0xe3127e68  57     NULLIFHNDL   NULLIFHNDL   0x000000000xe3128030  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d6129040xe31283c0  57     NULLIFHNDL   NULLIFHNDL   0x000000000xe3128588  57     NULLIFHNDL   NULLIFHNDL   0x000000000xe3128750  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d6129040xe3128918  57     NULLIFHNDL   NULLIFHNDL   0x000000000xe3129200  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d6129040xe3129590  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d6129040xe3129ae8  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d6129040xe3129cb0  57     NULLIFHNDL   NULLIFHNDL   0x000000000xe3129e78  57     NULLIFHNDL   NULLIFHNDL   0x000000000xe312a598  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d6129040xe312a760  57     NULLIFHNDL   NULLIFHNDL   0x000000000xe312aaf0  57     NULLIFHNDL   NULLIFHNDL   0x000000000xe312acb8  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d6129040xe312ae80  57     NULLIFHNDL   NULLIFHNDL   0x000000000xe312b5a0  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d6129040xe312b930  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d6129040xe312c3e0  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d6129040xe312c5a8  405    FastEthernet0/1/0/4NULLIFHNDL   0x4d612904 --More--    ``` 9. The quickest way to stablize the router would be to shut down the incoming interface where the attack is sourced.   11. Restart the UDP process:    ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:example#adminWed Aug 28 08:41:20.435 PSTRP/0/0/CPU0:example(admin)#process restart 405      ``` 13.
