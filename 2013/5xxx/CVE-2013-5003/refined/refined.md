Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Missing validation of parameters passed to `schema_export.php` and `pmd_pdf.php` files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject SQL statements that execute with the privileges of the control user, potentially gaining read and write access to the configuration storage database tables and, if the control user has sufficient privileges, read access to some tables in the `mysql` database. This leads to privilege escalation.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By injecting malicious SQL statements through the parameters of the vulnerable files (`schema_export.php` and `pmd_pdf.php`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be logged into phpMyAdmin and a control user must have been configured as part of the phpMyAdmin configuration storage installation.
