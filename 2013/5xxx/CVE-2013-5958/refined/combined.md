Symfony 2.0.25, 2.1.13, 2.2.9, and 2.3.6 have just been released; they contain
a security fix for the Security component (CVE-2013-5958).

Note

Even if the end of life of Symfony 2.0 was reached last month, we are also
releasing a new version for 2.0. Symfony 2.1 is also out of maintenance, but
we are still releasing new versions for security fixes until the end of
November 2013. Read our [release policy](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/releases.html#maintenance)
for more information.

A couple of weeks ago, I published a post about a [vulnerability in FOSUserBundle](http://symfony.com/blog/cve-2013-5750-security-issue-in-fosuserbundle-login-form).
Besides the fix in the bundle, I've also added an additional safeguard to the
encoders in the master branch (for the upcoming 2.4 version).

But as noticed by [Christophe Coevoet](https://connect.sensiolabs.com/api/alternates/c81121f4-fd7a-49b0-9284-cef4b0dde8e7),
the fix from the master branch should also have been merged in older branches
as the login form handling is done by the framework itself, not by the user code.

## [Affected versions](#affected-versions "Permalink to this headline")

All 2.0.X, 2.1.X, 2.2.X, and 2.3.X versions of the Security component are
affected by this issue.

## [Description](#description "Permalink to this headline")

One of the best practices for passwords is to store a hash of the password
instead of the raw value. In Symfony, the [encoders](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html#encoding-the-user-s-password)
are responsible for the hash creation (when a user creates an account) and
verification (when a user tries to log in).

For most built-in encoders, the time is takes to compute a hash increases
significantly with the length of the password. If an attacker submits random
large passwords repeatedly, Symfony will be forced to do expensive
computation, which can be used to ease a DOS attack.

All encoders are not vulnerable, but the recommended ones are. For
information, here are the times it takes to encode a password of 1 million
characters (lines with a `*` denotes the built-in encoder default
configurations):

| Encoder | encodePassword() |
| --- | --- |
| BCrypt (cost <14) | <1s |
| BCrypt (cost 18) | 20s |
| BCrypt (cost 20) | 78s |
| Pbkdf2\* (1,000 it) | 6s |
| Plaintext\* | <1s |
| MessageDigest\* (5,000 it) | 30s |
| Pbkdf2 (10,000 it) | 55s |

As you can see, for the `Pbkdf2` encoder, it takes almost one minute when the
number of iterations is set to `10,000` (which is the number of iterations
used in iOS 7.)

## [Resolution](#resolution "Permalink to this headline")

The password length for a user account **must** have a maximum length to
mitigate the attack. When a user enters or modifies a password on your
website, check that you have set a max length constraint. If you are using
FOSUserBundle, the fix was done a couple of weeks ago.

When the user tries to login on your website, the logic is handled by the
framework itself, and as such, it must also restrict the maximum length of the
password it accepts before encoding it. The patch we made on today's releases
consists of rejecting any password larger than `4096` characters. Both the
`encodePassword()` and `isPasswordValid()` methods of the built-in
encoders enforce this limit.

If you use a custom encoder, you need to check the password length with the
`$this->isPasswordTooLong($raw);` method yourself (have a look at the
built-in encoders implementation).

You need to upgrade Symfony to its latest version, according to the branch you
are using for your project, or you can apply the following patches:

* [Download the patch for Symfony 2.0](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/13d7d3a.patch);
* [Download the patch for Symfony 2.1](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/8735ba9.patch);
* [Download the patch for Symfony 2.2](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/67d4a8f.patch);
* [Download the patch for Symfony 2.3](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/67d4a8f.patch);

Tip

To be notified about important Symfony dates, consider subscribing to the
[roadmap notifications](http://symfony.com/roadmap).

Tip

You can check if your project is up-to-date with the latest security patches
by using the [SensioLabs Security Advisories Checker](https://security.sensiolabs.org/).

This CVE should be registered in the security advisories checker database. Currently, it will not warn about it as it does not know about it.

And you should also add it in the appropriate section of the documentation.
