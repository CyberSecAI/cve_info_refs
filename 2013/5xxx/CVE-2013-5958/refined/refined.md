The content is related to CVE-2013-5958.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Symfony's Security component handles password hashing. The time it takes to compute a hash increases with the length of the password for most built-in encoders. By repeatedly submitting large passwords, an attacker can force the system to perform expensive computations, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of a maximum length limit for passwords during login attempts.
- Time-consuming password hashing algorithms susceptible to DoS attacks with large inputs.
- Vulnerable encoders: Pbkdf2, MessageDigest, BCrypt.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial-of-Service (DoS): An attacker can make the system unresponsive by repeatedly submitting login attempts with extremely long passwords.
- Increased server load and potential resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending HTTP requests with login attempts using very long password strings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send login requests to the Symfony application.
- No special user permissions are required.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the application's login form.

**Resolution:**
- Applying patches for Symfony versions 2.0.25, 2.1.13, 2.2.9, and 2.3.6.
- The patch includes rejecting any password larger than 4096 characters before encoding.
- The `encodePassword()` and `isPasswordValid()` methods of built-in encoders now enforce this limit.
- Custom encoders should also check the password length using `$this->isPasswordTooLong($raw);`.
- Enforce max password length when a user modifies password on your website.
