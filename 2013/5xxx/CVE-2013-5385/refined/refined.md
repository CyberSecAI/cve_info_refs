{
  "CVE-2013-5385": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol does not specify unique Link State Advertisement (LSA) lookup identifiers, which allow an attacker to intercept traffic or conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The OSPF protocol uses only the Link State ID to query the LSA database, instead of using the combination of LS Type, Advertising Router, and Link State ID as intended. This allows for malformed duplicate entries to cause unexpected behavior.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier (CWE-694)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can subvert the routing table of a victim router by sending false link state advertisements. This can result in traffic being re-routed, compromising data confidentiality, or causing a denial-of-service by dropping all traffic.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted OSPF Router LSA (type-1) with a Link State ID that is not the same as the router ID. This LSA needs to come from a source IP that is an OSPF peer.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have control of a router within the same Autonomous System (AS) or be able to spoof a legitimate OSPF peer."
