Affected versions of Cisco ASA Software will vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions.   Vulnerable Products**IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      To be vulnerable, Cisco ASA Software must have at least one IPsec VPN tunnel with active traffic passing through the tunnel. This vulnerability cannot be exploited if offending packets are flowing through an SSL/TLS based VPN tunnel.       To determine whether the Cisco ASA Software is configured for IPsec VPN use, the command **show running-config crypto map** and verify that a crypto map is applied to at least one interface of the Cisco ASA. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with a crypto map called *outside\_map* that is applied to the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# sh running-config crypto map[...]crypto map outside_map interface outside   ``` **Note:** Cisco ASA Software does not have a crypto map applied by default to any interface.         **SQL\*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if SQL\*Net inspection is enabled.      To determine whether the SQL\*Net inspection is enabled, use the **show service-policy | include sqlnet** command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with SQL\*Net inspection enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show  service-policy | include sqlnet     Inspect: sqlnet, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0   ``` **Note:** SQL\*Net inspection is enabled by default.         **Digital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability in either of the following cases:   + Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN is configured to use digital certificate authentication   + Cisco ASDM is configured to use digital certificate authenticationTo determine whether the Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN is configured to use digital certificate authentication, use the **show runing-config webvpn** command. To verify if digital certificate authentication is enabled for the VPN features,   use the **show **running-config** tunnel-group**  where  is the tunnel group associated to the Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN profiles, and verify that the **authentication certificate** or **authentication aaacertificate** command is present under the tunnel-group webvpn-attributes.      The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN feature enabled on the *outside* interface and with certificate authentication enabled under the tunnel-group named *AnyConnect-TG*: ```       ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn       webvpn        enable outside          ciscoasa# show running-config tunnel-group AnyConnect-TG       [...]       tunnel-group DefaultRAGroup webvpn-attributes        authentication aaa certificate   ``` To determine whether Cisco ASDM is configured to use digital certificate authentication, use the **show running-config http** command and verify that both **http server enabled** and **http authentication-certificate** commands are present. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with Cisco ASDM and certificate authentication enabled on the *inside* interface: ```       ciscoasa# show running-config http       http server enable       [...]       http authentication-certificate inside   ``` On some Cisco ASA versions, the command **ssl certificate-authentication interface  port**  was used instead of the **http authentication-certificate**  command.      **Note:** Digital certificate authentication is disabled by default. This vulnerability does not affect Cisco ASA 5505, Cisco ASA 5510, Cisco ASA 5520, Cisco ASA 5540, and Cisco ASA 5550 products.         **Remote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:   1. It is configured for either Clientless or AnyConnect VPN, IKEv1 and IKEv2 Remote IPsec VPN and L2TP/IPsec VPN   2. The remote VPN is authenticated via a remote AAA server using LDAP   3. The **override-account-disable** option is configured under the tunnel-group general-attributes settings.Cisco ASA Software using any other remote AAA server or local AAA server for authentication of remote VPN is not affected by this vulnerability. Additionally, Cisco ASA Software configured for LAN-to-LAN IPsec VPN is not affected by this vulnerability.      To determine whether an LDAP AAA server and the **override-account-disable** command are configured under the tunnel-group general-attributes settings, use the **show running-config tunnel-group**  command.      The following example shows Cisco ASA Software configured to authenticate a remote VPN session using the tunnel-group *AnyConnect-TG* via a remote AAA server called *AAA-LDAP-SERVER* and with the **override-account-disable** option enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config tunnel-group AnyConnect-TG   tunnel-group test general-attributes    authentication-server-group AAA-LDAP-SERVER    override-account-disable   ``` Additionally, use the **show aaa-server protocol ldap** command to verify that the remote AAA server associated to the tunnel-group is an LDAP server. The following example shows a Cisco ASA configured with a AAA server called *AAA-LDAP-SERVER* running over LDAP: ```   ciscoasa# show aaa-server protocol ldapServer Group:    AAA-LDAP-SERVERServer Protocol: ldap[...]   ``` **Note:** The **override-account-disable** command is disabled by default.         **Digital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the digital certificate client authentication is enabled for Cisco ASDM. Use the **show **running-config** http** command to verify that the **authentication-certificate**  command is configured. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the **http authentication-certificate** command enabled on the *inside* interface: ```       ciscoasa# show running-config http       http server enable       [...]       http authentication-certificate inside   ``` On some Cisco ASA versions, the command **ssl certificate-authentication interface port**  was used instead of the **http authentication-certificate**  command.      **Note:** Digital certificate authentication is disabled by default for Cisco ASDM.         **HTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if HTTP Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is configured with any of the following options:   + The *spoof-server* parameters option is enabled   + The mask option is enabled and is inspecting the HTTP response with active-x in the body   + The mask option is enabled and is inspecting the HTTP response with java-applet in the bodyTo determine whether any of these configurations are present, use the **show running-config policy-map type inspect http** command. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software configured with a HTTP DPI policy called *HTTP\_DPI\_PM* with the *spoof-server* option enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map type inspect http   !   policy-map type inspect http HTTP_DPI_PM    parameters     spoof-server "Apache" !   ``` **Note:** The HTTP inspection engine and HTTP DPI are disabled by default. This vulnerability does not affect Cisco ASA 5505, Cisco ASA 5510, Cisco ASA 5520, Cisco ASA 5540, and Cisco ASA 5550 products.         **DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the DNS Application Layer Protocol Inspection (ALPI) engine is configured to inspect DNS packets over TCP.       To verify if the DNS ALPI engine is inspecting DNS packets over TCP, use the **show running-config access-list**  command where *acl\_name* is the name of the access-list used in the *class-map* to which the DNS inspection is applied.       This can be found by using the **show running-config class-map** and **show running-config policy-map** commands.      The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the DNS ALPI engine configured to inspect DNS packets over TCP. ```   ciscoasa# show running-config access-list   [...]   access-list DNS_INSPECT_ACL extended permit tcp any any   [...]       ```   OR   ```   ciscoasa# show running-config access-list   [...]   access-list DNS_INSPECT_ACL extended permit ip any any   [...]   ciscoasa# show running-config class-map   !   class-map DNS_INSPECT_CP    match access-list DNS_INSPECT   [...]   ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map   !   policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map    parameters     message-length maximum client auto     message-length maximum 512   policy-map global_policy    class inspection_default     inspect ftp     inspect h323 h225     [...]    class DNS_INSPECT_CP     inspect dns preset_dns_map   !      ``` **Note:** Cisco ASA Software will not inspect DNS packets over TCP by default.         **AnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is vulnerable if AnyConnect SSL VPN is configured. Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless SSL VPN, IKEv1/IKEv2 IPsec remote and LAN-to-LAN VPN, or L2TP/IPsec VPN is not affected by this vulnerability.       To determine whether Cisco ASA Software is configured with AnyConnect SSL VPN, use the **show running-config webvpn** and verify that the **svc enble** or **anyconnect** **enable** (as of Cisco ASA Software version 8.4(1)) command is present.      The   following example shows Cisco ASA Software with AnyConnect SSL VPN feature enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn   webvpn    [...]    svc enable   ``` **Note:** AnyConnect SSL VPN is disabled by default.         **SSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is vulnerable if Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN is configured. Cisco ASA Software configured for IKEv1/IKEv2 IPsec remote and LAN-to-LAN VPN, or L2TP/IPsec VPN is not affected by this vulnerability.      To determine if SSL VPN is enabled use the **show running-config webvpn** command.       The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the SSL VPN feature enabled on the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn        webvpn        enable outside         ``` **Note:** SSL VPN is disabled by default.      **Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is vulnerable if the ICMP inspection engine is configured to inspect ICMP packets that are traversing the firewall or if ICMP packets targeting firewall interfaces are allowed to be processed       The default behavior of the Cisco ASA Software is to allow and process all ICMP traffic to the firewall interfaces, meaning that default Cisco ASA Software configuration is vulnerable. The default ICMP policy is not visible in the firewall configuration; however this default ICMP policy can be disabled by using the commands **icmp deny any**  and **ipv6 icmp deny any**  if IP version 6 is enabled on the interface. If any of these two commands are configured they will be visible in the configuration. To determine if the default ICMP policy is disabled, use the **show running-config icmp | include deny any** command and verify that output is returned for each of the interfaces configured on the firewall. If there are any IPv6 enabled interfaces, to verify that the default ICMP policy is disabled for ICMPv6 use the **show running-config ipv6 | include icmp deny any** command and verify that output is returned for each of the IPv6 enabled interfaces configured on the firewall. Administrators should consider the system vulnerable if the command returns an empty output or the output shows that the configuration is applied on a subset of the firewall interfaces.      To determine if any non-default ICMP interface policy is configured on a device in such a way that permits certain ICMP packets destined to the firewall, use the **show running-config icmp | include permit** and **show running-config ipv6 | include icmp permit** command and verify the output that is returned for for each of the interfaces configured on the firewall.   Administrators should consider the system vulnerable if the command shows that the configuration permitting ICMP packets is applied on a subset of the firewall interfaces.      The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with non-default ICMP policy configured to permit ICMP echo-reply packets destined to the ASA firewall outside interface.    ```   ciscoasa#show running-config icmp | include permiticmp permit any echo-reply outside icmp permit any echo-reply dmz1   icmp permit any unreachable outside   icmp permit any echo outside      ```  ```   ciscoasa#show running-config ipv6 | include permit icmpipv6 icmp permit any echo outside ipv6 icmp permit any echo-reply outside   ipv6 icmp permit any neighbor-advertisement outside   ```       To verify if the ICMP inspect engine is configured to inspect ICMP packets traversing the firewall, use the **show running-config | include inspect icmp** command and verify that **inspect icmp** command is present. Configuration where only **inspect icmp error** is configured is not vulnerable.      The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the ICMP inspection engine configured to inspect ICMP packets traversing the ASA firewall.    ```   ciscoasa# show running-config | include inspect icmpinspect icmp   ```    **Note:** ICMP inspection engine is not enabled by default.Determining the Running Software VersionTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **show version** command. The following example shows a device running Cisco ASA Software version 8.4(1): ```   ciscoasa#show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) Device Manager Version 6.4(1)   ``` Customers who use Cisco ASDM to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco ASA-CX Context-Aware Security is not affected by any of these vulnerabilities.      With the exception of the Cisco FWSM, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is the operating system used by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, the Cisco ASA 5500-X Next Generation Firewall, the Cisco ASA Services Module (ASASM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, and the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall. The Cisco ASA family provides network security services such as firewall, intrusion prevention system (IPS), anti-X, and VPN.      **IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in IPsec code could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.      The vulnerability is due to an error in the code that decrypts packets transiting an active VPN tunnel. In particular the code is failing at properly handling crafted ICMP packets after a decryption operation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted ICMP packets through an active VPN tunnel. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the device that performs the decryption operation.      **Note:** Only ICMP traffic passing through an active IPsec VPN tunnel can trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed mode in both single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by ICMP and ICMPv6 packets.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue18975](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue18975) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5507.      **SQL\*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in SQL\*Net inspection engine code could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system.       The vulnerability is due to improper handling of segmented Transparent Network Substrate (TNS) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted sequence of segmented TNS packets through the affected system.      **Note:** Only transit traffic that is inspected by the Cisco ASA SQL\*Net inspection engine can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) traffic.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCub98434](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub98434) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5508.      **Digital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the code for SSL certificate validation of the Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the certificate authentication.      The vulnerability is due to an error in handling a client crafted certificate during the authentication phase. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to authenticate to the affected system using a crafted certificate. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the certificate authentication. Depending on the Cisco ASA configuration, this may allow the attacker to authenticate and access the network via Clientless or Anyconnect SSL VPN or to get administrative management access via Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM).      This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured for client digital certificate authentication for Clientless and AnyConnect SSL VPN or for remote management via Cisco ASDM.      Cisco ASA Software running on Cisco ASA 5505, Cisco ASA 5510, Cisco ASA 5520, Cisco ASA 5540, and Cisco ASA 5550 is not affected by this vulnerability.      **Note:** Only traffic directed to the affected device can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A TCP three-way handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuf52468](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf52468) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5509.      **Remote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the authentication code of the remote access VPN feature of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the remote VPN authentication, which could allow remote access to the inside network.      The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of the LDAP response packet received from a remote AAA LDAP server when the *override-account-disable* option is configured in the general-attributes of the tunnel-group. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate via remote VPN to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the authentication and gain access to the network via remote VPN.      This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN, IKEv1 and IKEv2 Remote IPsec VPN and L2TP/IPsec VPN. Additionally an external AAA LDAP server should be in use for remote VPN authentication service. Cisco ASA Software using any other protocol for remote AAA service or local AAA server for authentication of remote VPN is not affected by this vulnerability. Cisco ASA Software configured for LAN-to-LAN VPN is not affected by this vulnerability.       For Cisco ASA Software configured with IKEv1 Remote IPsec VPN and L2TP/IPsec VPN the attacker must have knowledge of the tunnel-group password or hold a valid digital certificate in order to exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, an attacker must know a valid username to exploit this vulnerability.      **Note:** Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured only in routed firewall mode in only single context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCug83401](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug83401) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5510.         **Digital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the authentication code of remote management via Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the digital certificate authentication. Depending on the configuration, this may allow the attacker to remotely connect as administrator to the management interface via Cisco ASDM and take full control of the affected system.      The vulnerability is due to an error in the implementation of the *authentication-certificate* option, which enables client-side digital certificate authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to authenticate to an interface of the affected system where Cisco ASDM is enabled.      **Note:** Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A TCP three-way handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh44815](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh44815) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5511.      **HTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in HTTP Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) code could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system.      The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a race condition when the HTTP DPI engine is inspecting HTTP packets and either the *spoof-server* parameters option is enabled or the Cisco ASA Software is configured to inspect and mask the HTTP response including active-x or java-applet in the response body. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP response through the affected system.      **Note:** Only transit traffic that it is inspected by the HTTP DPI engine can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCud37992](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud37992) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5512.      **DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the DNS Application Layer Protocol Inspection (ALPI) engine of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of the affected device.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of unsupported DNS over TCP packets by the DNS inspection engine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS messages over TCP through an affected device.      **Note:** Only transit traffic that it is inspected by the DNS ALPI engine can be used to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCug03975](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug03975) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5513.      **AnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in how Cisco ASA Software handles AnyConnect SSL VPN client connections could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust available memory which could cause the affected system to become unresponsive and transit traffic to be dropped.      The vulnerability is due to improperly clearing unused memory blocks after an AnyConnect SSL VPN client disconnects. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic to the IP address of the disconnected client.      This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured for AnyConnect SSL VPN. Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless SSL VPN, IKEv1 and IKEv2 remote IPsec VPN, LAN-to-LAN VPN or L2TP/IPSEC VPN is not affected by this vulnerability.      **Note:** Only transit traffic can be used to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed firewall mode and single context mode only. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtt36737](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtt36737) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3415.      **SSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability**    A vulnerability in the Web Portal for SSL VPN could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the reload of the affected system.         The vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted HTTPS requests   against the Cisco ASA Software configured for SSL VPN. An attacker could   exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS requests targeting   Web Portal pages for SSL VPN.         This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured for either Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN. Cisco ASA Software configured for IKEv1 and IKEv2 remote IPsec VPN, LAN-to-LAN VPN or L2TP/IPSEC VPN is not affected by this vulnerability.      **Note:** Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed firewall mode and single context mode only. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCua22709](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua22709) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5515.         **Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in function handling ICMP packets of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a arbitrary connections to be cleared and a reload of the affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted ICMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted ICMP packets to or through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to clear arbitrary connections on the firewall or cause a reload of the affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.      **Note:** This   vulnerability can be triggered by transit traffic and by traffic directed to the affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured   in routed and transparent firewall mode and single context or multiple context mode. This vulnerability   can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCui77398](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui77398) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5542  Workarounds  * **IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      For VPN setup involving LAN-to-LAN tunnel, it is possible to avoid the decryption of an offending ICMP packet by implementing a vpn-filer access-list. The following commands will implement an access-list that blocks any ICMP packets flowing through a VPN tunnel that use the *DfltGrpPolicy* group-policy in both inbound and outbound direction: ```       ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL deny icmp any any       ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL permit ip any any       ciscoasa(config)# group-policy DfltGrpPolicy attributes       ciscoasa(config-group-policy)# vpn-filter value DENY_ICMP_ACL   ``` **Note:** Because the vulnerability is triggered during the decryption operation, this workaround should be implemented on both devices terminating the VPN tunnel. This workaround is ineffective if applied to only on one side of the tunnel.      For Cisco remote IPsec VPN there is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.       **SQL\*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Disabling Cisco ASA SQL\*Net inspection will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the SQL\*Net inspection that is configured by default: ```       ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy       ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default       ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect sqlnet   ``` **Digital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      There is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.      **Remote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      There are no workarounds other than disabling the override-account-disable option.       **Digital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      There is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.      **HTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability**      There are no workarounds other than removing the affected option from the HTTP DPI configuration      **DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Administrators can workaround this issue by ensuring that only UDP traffic is sent to the DNS ALPI engine for inspection.      To do that, first create an access-list to match only UDP traffic and then create a class-map to match on that access-list. Note that by default the Cisco ASA Software will only inspect DNS over UDP traffic. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software forwarding only UDP port 53 traffic to the DNS ALPI engine. ```   ciscoasa# show running-config access-list   access-list DNS_INSPECT extended permit udp any any eq 53      ciscoasa# show running-config class-map   !   class-map DNS_INSPECT_CP    match access-list DNS_INSPECT   [...]      ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map   !   policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map    parameters     message-length maximum client auto     message-length maximum 512   policy-map global_policy    class inspection_default     inspect ftp     inspect h323 h225     [...]     class DNS_INSPECT_CP     inspect dns preset_dns_map   !   ``` **Note:** Inspection of DNS traffic over TCP is currently not supported by the Cisco ASA Software. Implementing this workaround does not create any loss in functionality.      **AnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability**      There is no workaround other than disabling AnyConnect SSL VPN feature.      **SSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability**      There is no workaround other than disabling the SSL VPN feature.      **Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Administrators can disable the default ICMP policy and ICMP inspection engine to work around this vulnerability.   To disable the default ICMP policy use the **icmp deny any**  command for all the configured interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. To disable the default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 use the **ipv6 icmp deny any**  command for all the IPv6 enabled interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. The following example shows how to disable the default ICMP policy and default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 on the *outside* interface ```   ciscoasa(config)# icmp deny any outsideciscoasa(config)# ipv6 icmp deny any outside    ``` **Note:** Disabling the ICMP processing on the firewall interface may result in administrators not being able to receive any more information from the firewall via ICMP, which includes ping, traceroute, etc. Disabling the ICMPv6 processing on the firewall interface may result in the firewall not being able to communicate on that interface due to a missing neighbor discovery and neighbor advertisement ICMPv6 packets.      To disable the ICMP inspection engine, use the **no inspect icmp** command within the policy-map applied to the service polices.   The following example shows how to disable the ICMP inspection engine in the policy-map called *global\_policy*: ```   ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect icmp    ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |
