Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details related to CVE-2013-5511:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- An error in the implementation of the `authentication-certificate` option for Cisco ASDM, which enables client-side digital certificate authentication. This improper implementation allows an attacker to bypass certificate authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Digital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability lies in the flawed handling of client certificates during the authentication process for Cisco ASDM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the digital certificate authentication.
- Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to remotely connect to the management interface via Cisco ASDM.
- This access can lead to full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- It involves sending a crafted certificate during the authentication process to the interface where Cisco ASDM is enabled.
- A TCP three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send traffic to the affected system.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious certificate to bypass authentication.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed and transparent firewall mode, in both single and multiple context mode.
- It can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- The vulnerability is associated with Cisco bug ID CSCuh44815.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is Base 10.0, Temporal 8.3 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C).
- The content also lists several other CVEs related to Cisco ASA software.
- The advisory provides workarounds and fixed software versions for each of the vulnerabilities.
- Digital certificate authentication is disabled by default for Cisco ASDM
