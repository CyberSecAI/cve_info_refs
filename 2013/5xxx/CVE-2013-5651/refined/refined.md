  "CVE-2013-5651": {
    "description": "It was discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled certain bitmap operations. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause libvirt to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 13.04.",
    "root_cause": "The `virBitmapParse` function was calling `virBitmapIsSet` without proper bounds checking, leading to out-of-bounds read when parsing a bitmap string exceeding the bitmap's allocated size.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (libvirtd crash)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted bitmap string."
