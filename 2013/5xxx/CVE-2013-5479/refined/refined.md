Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Cisco IOS Software's Network Address Translation (NAT) feature, specifically in the improper handling of certain valid DNS TCP streams. This improper handling leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of valid DNS TCP streams during NAT.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by malformed DNS packets sent over TCP port 53, while DNS over UDP is not affected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause an affected Cisco device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated.
- An attacker can send crafted DNS packets to TCP port 53 targeting a Cisco device configured for NAT.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require authentication.
- The attacker only needs the ability to send network packets to a Cisco IOS device with NAT enabled, and the device is reachable via network.
- The attacker does not require a three-way handshake for the exploit to work.
- The attacker needs to craft specific DNS packets over TCP (port 53).

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is specifically identified by Cisco bug ID CSCtn53730.
- The vulnerability is related to other vulnerabilities in the same advisory (CVE-2013-5480 and CVE-2013-5481) which are also caused by improper handling of packets during NAT, although these are related to PPTP.
- There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability, only software updates to fix the issue.
- The advisory provides extensive details about affected Cisco IOS software versions and when fixes were available.
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was discovered during TAC customer service requests troubleshooting, and that there is no public awareness or malicious use of the vulnerability known to the PSIRT.
-  It is explicitly stated that IPv6 and UDP port 53 traffic will not trigger the vulnerability
-  The advisory also references RFC-5966 which dictates DNS should function on TCP and disturbing that traffic can cause issues
