Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-5704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how the Apache HTTP Server (`httpd`) handles HTTP Trailer headers within chunked encoded requests. Specifically, it does not properly process or restrict the inclusion of Trailer headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of HTTP Trailer Headers:** The `httpd` server processes HTTP Trailer headers after header processing by other modules, allowing malicious clients to inject additional headers after header restrictions (set by modules such as `mod_headers`) have been applied.
*   **Bypass of `mod_headers` rules:** This improper handling enables attackers to circumvent header restrictions set up by the `mod_headers` module, thus potentially injecting headers that should have been removed by `mod_headers`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Header Restrictions:** A malicious client can use this flaw to send requests to applications with additional HTTP headers that should have been removed by `mod_headers`. This can bypass security policies implemented using `mod_headers`.
*   **Potential for Other Attacks:**  The ability to bypass header restrictions might open the door to further exploitation, such as HTTP request smuggling.
*   **Information Disclosure**: As described in a Red Hat Bugzilla entry, an attacker can send a malicious request that contains HTTP Trailer headers, which are then processed by the httpd core after header processing by other modules. This can cause a bypass of header restrictions defined with mod\_headers, which can then be used to send additional headers which may lead to an information leak or potentially be used to bypass access control mechanisms

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted chunked encoded requests to a vulnerable `httpd` server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the targeted server.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests that include chunked encoding with malicious Trailer headers.
