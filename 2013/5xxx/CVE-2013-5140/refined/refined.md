- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sending an invalid packet fragment to a device can cause a kernel assert to trigger.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Kernel assert leading to a device restart.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attacker can cause a device to unexpectedly restart.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending an invalid packet fragment to a device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker.
