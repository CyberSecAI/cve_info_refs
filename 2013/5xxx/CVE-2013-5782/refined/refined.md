    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple input checking flaws in the 2D component native image parsing code.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Incorrect raster attribute verification in awt_getPixelByte, awt_getPixelShort, awt_setPixelByte, and awt_setPixelShort functions. This leads to memory corruption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could trigger a Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the virtual machine.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted image file could trigger the vulnerability",
