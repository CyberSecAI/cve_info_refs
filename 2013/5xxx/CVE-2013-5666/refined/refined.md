Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `sendfile(2)` system call implementation within FreeBSD. When the requested length of data to be transmitted via `sendfile(2)` is greater than the actual file size, the function would pad the transmission. This padding could potentially read and disclose kernel memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is an information disclosure issue due to the `sendfile(2)` padding behavior. The padding reads beyond the file, disclosing potentially sensitive kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Kernel Memory Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially obtain arbitrary kernel memory contents by exploiting this vulnerability. This memory could contain sensitive data, such as passwords, cryptographic keys, or other private information.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Exploitation:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable FreeBSD system. This is achieved by making `sendfile(2)` system call with a length greater than the file size.
-   **Application Trigger:** This is not a vulnerability that is directly exploitable over the network. The attacker would likely need to exploit a service using `sendfile` to force the vulnerable padding behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to run arbitrary code on the vulnerable FreeBSD system.
-   **User Level Access:** An unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in FreeBSD 9.2-RC1 and 9.2-RC2.
*   The fix involves correcting the length calculation to prevent the padding from reading kernel memory.
*   The issue is specific to `sendfile(2)` with non-zero length values that exceed the actual file size.
