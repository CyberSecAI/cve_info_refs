Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in extplorer, specifically when processing URL parameters. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML code via crafted strings in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability is present in multiple files within the extplorer application, including `application.js.php`, `admin.php`, `copy_move.php`, `functions.php`, `header.php` and `upload.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary web script or HTML code in the context of a user's browser when they access the vulnerable application. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
*   Stealing cookies/session data
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites
*   Modifying the content of the application page
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload and then tricking a user into accessing the URL, typically through a link or a redirect. The malicious code is embedded within the crafted URL parameters targeting the vulnerable files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs, and the victim must be enticed to open the malicious URL using their browser. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the victim's system other than the ability to communicate with the target extplorer server. The attack can be executed remotely.
