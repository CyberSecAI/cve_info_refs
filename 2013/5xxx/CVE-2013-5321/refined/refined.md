Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in multiple parameters used in SQL queries. Specifically, the application fails to validate or escape user-supplied data before incorporating it into SQL statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection in multiple parameters. This allows an attacker to infer information from the database by observing the application's response to crafted SQL queries (e.g., through timing differences or error messages).
- The specific vulnerable parameters identified are:
    - `sensor` in `base_qry_main.php`
    - `tcp_flags` in `base_stat_alerts.php`
    - `tcp_port` in `base_stat_alerts.php`
    - `ip_addr` in `base_stat_ports.php`
    - `port_type` in `base_stat_ports.php`
    - `sortby` in `vulnmeter/index.php`
    - `rvalue` in `vulnmeter/index.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
    - **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, potentially including user credentials, system configurations, and other confidential data.
    - **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker may be able to modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or denial of service.
    - **System Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to execute arbitrary code on the database server, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP pages within the web application.
- Attackers manipulate specific parameters in the URL by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required for exploiting these vulnerabilities in the provided content. The attacker would likely need to have access to the application's web interface.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit-db entry mentions a timeline showing the vulnerability was reported to the vendor in February 2013, but the vendor didn't respond, leading to public disclosure in June 2013.
- The exploit-db entry provides concrete examples of Proof of Concept (POC) URLs demonstrating how to inject SQL code into the vulnerable parameters.
