- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An access control issue existed in the Twitter subsystem.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sandboxed apps could bypass supported APIs and make requests directly to a system daemon, thus interfering with or controlling Twitter functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sandboxed apps could send tweets without user interaction or permission.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious applications could bypass the intended API usage to interact directly with the Twitter daemon.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to install and run a malicious sandboxed application on the device.
