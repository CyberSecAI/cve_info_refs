Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-5848:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2013-5848 is an unspecified vulnerability within the "Deployment" component of Oracle JDK/JRE. The exact nature of the flaw is not detailed.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the "Deployment" component, implying issues with how the Java environment manages or handles deployed applications or code.
*   Lack of detail on the specific vulnerability makes it difficult to assess the exact weakness.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is primarily related to potential for unauthorized modifications.
*   CVSS base scores range from 5.0 (from RHSA-2013:1440) implying a moderate impact. IBM (RHSA-2013:1507 and RHSA-2013:1508) scores it at 9.3 or 10.0, while Secunia also cites a 10.0 CVSS score indicating a critical impact in their analysis. 
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to modify resources.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, suggesting an attack vector via network interactions.
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the "Deployment" component of Java, likely related to how deployed applications or code is handled.
*   Exploitation may involve maliciously crafted or unexpected parameters during application deployment processes.
*  The Apple document suggests that a maliciously crafted untrusted Java applet in a webpage could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires network access to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker does not require authentication, indicating the flaw can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote actor.
*   The attacker needs to provide inputs that trigger the vulnerability in the "Deployment" component.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple sources confirm this vulnerability was fixed in Oracle Java SE Update 45.
*   Red Hat Security Advisories for `java-1.7.0-oracle` (RHSA-2013:1440), `java-1.7.0-ibm` (RHSA-2013:1507), and `java-1.6.0-ibm` (RHSA-2013:1508) identify CVE-2013-5848 as a critical vulnerability and include it in their fixes. The IBM advisories also mention it's fixed in IBM Java SE 7 SR6, and IBM Java SE 6 SR15 respectively.
*   Red Hat Satellite also has a fix available (RHSA-2013:1793), which also included CVE-2013-5848.
*   The IBM Security Bulletin abstract states it as part of the issues disclosed in the Oracle October 2013 Java SE Critical Patch Update, plus 6 additional vulnerabilities.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as “Important” in the Red Hat Security Advisory, but is "Critical" in the IBM and Apple advisories. The CVSS score is 5, however the IBM advisory uses a higher score of 9.3 or 10.0.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Java 7 Update 45, Java SE 6 Update 75 and IBM JDK 6 SR15.
*   Hitachi's advisory on multiple vulnerabilities in Cosminexus lists this CVE as well.

In summary, CVE-2013-5848 is a remotely exploitable vulnerability in the "Deployment" component of Oracle Java, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to make unauthorized modifications. It appears to be part of a collection of vulnerabilities addressed by Oracle's October 2013 CPU. The lack of a detailed description of the root cause makes it difficult to fully assess the vulnerability.
