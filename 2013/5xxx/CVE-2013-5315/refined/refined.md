{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Scald module does not sufficiently filter atom properties, such as the atom title, when outputting atoms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the atom properties, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of other users' browsers.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must have a role with the permission to create atoms, and the Scald Flash module or the resource management feature (in the MEE submodule) must be enabled."
