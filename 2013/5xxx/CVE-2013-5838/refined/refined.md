    "description": "Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Libraries, Swing, JAX-WS, JAXP, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Libraries"
     ],
    "root_cause": "Improper permission checks in the Libraries component of OpenJDK.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
       "Insufficient permission checks",
       "Java sandbox restrictions bypass"
    ],
     "impact": "An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Java Virtual Machine.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote exploitation via a crafted Java application or applet",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to run untrusted Java code (e.g., via a web browser)",
   "additional_details": "This vulnerability is present in the Libraries component of OpenJDK, and could allow a malicious Java applet to bypass security restrictions. This vulnerability is one of several fixed in Oracle's October 2013 Critical Patch Update. The vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service."
