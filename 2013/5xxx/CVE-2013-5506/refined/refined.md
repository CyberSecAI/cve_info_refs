Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-5506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization safeguards for certain administrative commands within a user context when the Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) is configured in multiple context mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper checks to ensure a user in one context does not have privileges to affect other contexts. This violates the principle of least privilege and allows for unauthorized access.
*   **Command Authorization Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the intended authorization controls by executing specific commands from a user context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An authenticated but unprivileged, local attacker can:
    *   **Delete** the configuration of other contexts.
    *   **Modify** the configuration of other contexts.
    *   **View** the configuration of other contexts.
*   This means an attacker can gain complete control over the firewall configurations, potentially leading to severe security breaches, data compromise or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local command line access to at least one user context.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute certain administrative commands.
*   **Multiple Context Mode:** The FWSM must be running in multiple context mode for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to at least one user context.
*   **Unprivileged:** The attacker does not need special administrative privileges within their context but must have some command execution ability
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the FWSM's command-line interface (CLI). This indicates an internal attacker or an attacker who has already compromised some part of the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco FWSM software configured in multiple context mode, in either routed or transparent firewall mode.
*   The vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue46080.
*   The provided CVSS vector `AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C` indicates:
    *   **AV:L** (Local access vector)
    *   **AC:L** (Low attack complexity)
    *   **Au:S** (Single authentication is needed)
    *   **C:C** (Complete confidentiality impact)
    *   **I:C** (Complete integrity impact)
    *   **A:C** (Complete availability impact)
    *   **E:F** (Functional exploit)
    *   **RL:OF** (Official fix available)
    *   **RC:C** (Confirmed report)
*   The vulnerability is fixed in FWSM software versions 3.2(27) and 4.1(14) and later.
