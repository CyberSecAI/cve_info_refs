- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper initialization of the Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) in Android applications using Java Cryptography Architecture. This leads to cryptographically weak values for key generation, signing, or random number generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The core vulnerability lies in the weak PRNG initialization within the affected IBM Worklight and Mobile Foundation products on Android. This results in predictable or biased random number generation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to weak keys, signatures, or predictable random numbers, making cryptographic operations vulnerable to attacks like data compromise or tampering, or gaining unauthorized access due to predictable session or authentication tokens.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves any application using the vulnerable PRNG through the Java Cryptography Architecture. An attacker could exploit this by analyzing or predicting generated values.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to access the generated weak random values, which could be achieved through various means depending on the application, potentially including reverse engineering or exploiting application specific functionalities. The attacker doesn't need privileged access to the underlying system, they need to access the application and be able to observe or interact with the flawed crypto.
