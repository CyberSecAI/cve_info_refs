Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-5558

**Root Cause:** A coding error in the WIL-A module of the Cisco TelePresence VX Clinical Assistant software version 1.2 causes the password for the `admin` user to be reset to a blank password on every system reboot. This occurs whether a password has previously been set for the user or not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication by logging in as the `admin` user with a blank password.
*   **Password Reset on Reboot:** The configured password for the `admin` user is overwritten with a blank password on every reboot, making password protection ineffective.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation grants an attacker full administrative access to the affected device. This can lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.
    *   Potential for malicious actions, including modification of device configurations, data theft, and disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **No Prior Knowledge or Access:** The attacker doesn't need valid credentials or prior knowledge of the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Exploit Availability:** The exploit is considered to be highly exploitable according to the CVSS score (E:H), implying that the attack is easily conducted.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Cisco TelePresence VX Clinical Assistant units running software version 1.2. Software versions 1.0 and 1.1 are not affected.
*   There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in Cisco TelePresence VX Clinical Assistant software version 1.21.
*   The CVSS score is 10.0 (base) and 8.7 (temporal) indicating a critical vulnerability.
