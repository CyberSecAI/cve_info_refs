Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2013-5316:

**CVE-2013-5316** is referenced in the Exploit Database entry for RiteCMS 1.0.0, which indicates the presence of multiple vulnerabilities. The provided content focuses on two specific issues, but note that the CVE description is not included. 

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discussed:

**1. CSRF - Adding an admin account:**
   *   **Root Cause:** The RiteCMS application does not properly validate the origin of requests that add or modify user accounts.
   *   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application doesn't include proper CSRF protection measures like tokens.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into adding a new admin account with attacker-controlled credentials.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        * The attacker creates a malicious HTML page (provided in the exploit) that includes a form targeting the RiteCMS's user management endpoint.
        * The attacker tricks an authenticated administrator user into opening the attacker-controlled HTML page. This can be achieved through methods such as phishing, or by hosting the HTML page on a website that the administrator may visit.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
         * The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious HTML page.
         * A logged-in administrator needs to be a victim of this attack.

**2. Cross-site scripting (XSS):**
   *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.
   *  **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application renders user-controlled data directly in the page content.
   *   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable parameter which can be executed in the browser of other users, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker sends a crafted URL to a victim which contains JavaScript in the `mode` parameter. When the victim opens this link, the JavaScript executes in their browser.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker only needs to craft a malicious URL with a crafted XSS payload in the `mode` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit code targets version 1.0.0 of RiteCMS, and it also says that it was tested on Linux & Windows, PHP 5.2.9.
*   The exploit demonstrates a CSRF vulnerability to add a new administrator account. It does not demonstrate password changes. The content provided does not match the summary of the CVE, however, the content refers to CVE-2013-5316 and CVE-2013-5317.

**Summary of Findings:**
The provided content reveals that RiteCMS 1.0.0 is vulnerable to CSRF, which allows an attacker to add admin accounts. It also indicates an XSS vulnerability via the mode parameter.

The vulnerabilities in RiteCMS 1.0.0, as described in the Exploit Database entry, correspond to the general weaknesses described in relation to CVE-2013-5316, although the exact description is not provided and there are inconsistencies.
