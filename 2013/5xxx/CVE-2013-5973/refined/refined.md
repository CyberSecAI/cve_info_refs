Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5973:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how VMware ESXi and ESX handle Virtual Machine file descriptors. Specifically, it's related to the "Add Existing Disk" functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of file descriptors, allowing access to arbitrary files on the ESXi or ESX system.
- Lack of proper privilege checks when accessing files through the "Add Existing Disk" operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker can gain read and write access to arbitrary files on the ESXi or ESX host.
- **Code Execution (Potential):** Modifying certain files may enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code after a host reboot.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged vCenter Server user with the "Add Existing Disk" privilege or an unprivileged local user on ESX can exploit this vulnerability to gain higher privileges

**Attack Vectors:**
- **vCenter Server:** An unprivileged vCenter Server user with the privilege “Add Existing Disk” can exploit the vulnerability. Users assigned the predefined "Virtual Machine Power User" or "Resource Pool Administrator" roles have this privilege by default.
- **Local Access:** On ESX systems, an unprivileged local user can exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable via VMware vCloud Director

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For vCenter Server attack: The attacker needs to have a valid user account on vCenter Server with the "Add Existing Disk" privilege.
- For local ESX attack: The attacker needs to have local access to the ESX system and an unprivileged user account.
- Exploitation requires some expertise.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to VMware by Shanon Olsson through JPCERT.
- The issue is addressed in the provided patches.
- A workaround is available in VMware Knowledge Base article 2066856.
- There are some known issues after deploying the patches, specifically if the `/etc/vmware/configrules` file has been modified manually, and issues with virtual machines with names ending in `-flat`, `-rdm`, or `-rdmp`.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity by JVN based on CVSS metrics. However, VMware classifies it as "Critical" severity.
