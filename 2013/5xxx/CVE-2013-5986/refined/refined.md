Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2013-5986:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An issue existed that allowed writes to some trusted memory on the graphics card. This was present in the NVIDIA drivers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Inappropriate memory access to the GPU from user-mode software. The driver allowed unprivileged user-mode software to access the GPU inappropriately, enabling writes to some trusted memory regions on the graphics card.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Executing a malicious application could result in arbitrary code execution within the graphics card.
- An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attacker needs to execute specially crafted software locally on the target machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to run code locally on the target system.
- Expert knowledge of system and NVIDIA GPU programming is required to create such an exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided NVIDIA document explicitly states: "*NOTE: This disclosure also covers CVE-2013-5986.*"
- The vulnerability was discovered by Marcin Ko≈õcielnicki from the X.Org Foundation Nouveau project.
- The fix for this issue is implemented in NVIDIA driver updates.
- The vulnerability could affect all supported PC OS platforms and form factors. NVIDIA Tegra GPUs are not vulnerable.
-  Apple addressed this issue by removing the ability of the host to write to that memory.
