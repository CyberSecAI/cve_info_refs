Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-5596:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a race condition due to a cycle-collected image object being released on the wrong thread during decoding. Specifically, the `RasterImage::DoError` function was being called from a decoding thread, which doesn't have a cycle collector. This is a threading issue within the image decoding pipeline.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race condition:**  The primary vulnerability is a race condition that occurs when an image object is released on a thread that does not have an active cycle collector.
- **Incorrect Thread Context:** The function `RasterImage::DoError`, which is part of the error handling in the image decoding process, was being called from a worker thread instead of the main thread where it is safe to execute the code that calls the cycle collector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash due to attempting to access the cycle collector from the wrong thread. The crash can be triggered by loading extremely large pages or a large number of images.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in all sources, some of the provided content mentions the potential for arbitrary code execution, which is typical of memory corruption vulnerabilities especially when they are linked to cycle collection or threading.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Browsing:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to view a specially crafted web page containing a large number of images or a single very large image.
- **Email (Potentially):** While scripting is generally disabled in email clients like Thunderbird and SeaMonkey, it's noted as a "potential risk" if the email context is browser-like.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** The attacker does not need physical access to the victim's machine.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice the user to open a specially crafted web page or email. This makes it a user-assisted attack.
- **Crafted Content:** The attacker needs to prepare a specific web page or email containing many images or a single very large image that will trigger the race condition during the decoding process.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was initially suspected to be related to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions, but further investigation revealed a threading bug related to the cycle collector.
- The vulnerability was triggered specifically when multithreaded image decoding was enabled.
- A fix was implemented by ensuring that `RasterImage::DoError` is always called on the main thread. This included a new `HandleErrorWorker` to handle error scenarios on the correct thread and a new `mPendingError` flag to manage these scenarios.
- The fix was first landed on the main development branch (mozilla-central) and then backported to affected release branches, including Firefox ESR 24 and Firefox 25.
- Some reports of crashes with empty signatures are likely due to address space exhaustion related to the memory management issue.
