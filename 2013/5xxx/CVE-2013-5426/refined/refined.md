- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unspecified vulnerability in IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management â€“ Collaborative Edition allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a user's session. The vulnerability is related to session fixation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Session fixation vulnerability that allows an attacker to hijack a user's session.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can impersonate a legitimate user and perform any actions available to that user, potentially accessing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must have access to a user's open browser before the user authenticates with the IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Collaboration Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to the user's browser before the user authenticates. The attacker also needs to be able to gather information from the user's browser session that will allow them to impersonate that user, if the user later authenticates.
