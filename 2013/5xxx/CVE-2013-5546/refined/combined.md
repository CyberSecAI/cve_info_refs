Affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software for 1000 Series ASR will vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the Software Versions and Fixes section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions.   Vulnerable ProductsFor specific version information, refer to the Software Versions and Fixes section of this advisory.      **Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could cause an affected device to reload when processing malformed ICMP error packets that belong to a TCP or UDP connection that is inspected by a Zone-Based Firewall (ZBFW). The ZBFW is not enabled by default.      To verify if a ZBFW is configured on a device, use the **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **Match: protocol tcp** or **Match:** **protocol udp** and **Inspect** under the configured zone pair class map in the output of **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair** indicates that the ZBFW inspection for TCP or UDP protocols is configured.      The following output is for **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair** on Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured as a ZBFW: ```   Router#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair   Zone-pair: clients-servers   Service-policy inspect : clients-servers-policy    Class-map: L4-inspect-class (match-any)        Match: protocol tcp      Match: protocol udp      Match: protocol icmp      Inspect            ``` **Note:** Cisco IOS devices configured with a ZBFW are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.      **Cisco IOS XE Software PPTP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) packets that undergo Network Address Translation (NAT) and PPTP application layer gateway (ALG) inspection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of PPTP packets to traverse a device that is configured for NAT.      Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability if NAT and PPTP ALG are enabled on an affected device; these services are not enabled by default.      PPTP ALG is enabled on a device when NAT is enabled.       To determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the **ip nat inside** or **ip nat outside** commands must be present in different interfaces and at least one **ip nat** global configuration command must be present in the configuration.       The **show running-config | include ip nat** command can be used to determine whether NAT is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:    ```   asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat ip nat inside ip nat outside ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1    ```  If the output is empty, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on a given device is not vulnerable. If the output returned is not empty, PPTP ALG services may be explicitly disabled in the NAT configuration. To determine whether PPTP ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration, use the **show run | include ip nat** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **no ip nat service pptp** in the output of **show run | include ip nat** indicates that PPTP ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration.      The following is the output of **show run | include ip nat** in Cisco IOS XE Software that has the PPTP ALG disabled under NAT configuration:    ```         asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat       ip nat inside       ip nat outside       ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1       no ip nat service pptp    ```         **Note:** A configuration command to disable PPTP ALG in the NAT configuration is available in Cisco IOS XE Software versions 3.9 and above. On Cisco IOS XE Software versions prior to 3.9, there is no capability to disable PPTP ALG in the NAT configuration.      Cisco IOS devices configured for PPTP ALG inspection are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.            **Cisco IOS XE Software TCP Segment Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing segmented TCP packets that undergo Network Address Translation (NAT). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending TCP packets that are large after the segment reassembly is complete when these packets traverse a device that is configured for NAT.      TCP reassembly is enabled when NAT is enabled.      To determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the **ip nat inside** or **ip nat outside** commands must be present in different interfaces and at least one **ip nat** global configuration command must be present in the configuration.       The **show running-config | include ip nat** command can be used to determine whether NAT is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:    ```   asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat ip nat inside ip nat outside ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1    ```  Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with embedded services processor 100 (ASR1000-ESP100) and Cisco ASR1002-X Series Routers are affected by this vulnerability.      To determine whether a Cisco ASR 1000 device has ASR1000-ESP100 installed or is a Cisco ASR1002-X Series Router, administrators can issue the **show inventory** command. The following is the output of the **show inventory** in Cisco IOS XE Software running on a Cisco ASR 1006 Router with ASR1000-ESP100:  ```      asr1006#show inventory    NAME: "Chassis", DESCR: "Cisco ASR1006 Chassis"   PID: ASR1006             NAME: "module F1", DESCR: "Cisco ASR1000 Embedded Services Processor, 10 0Gbps"   PID: ASR1000-ESP10 0          ```    **Note:** Cisco IOS devices configured for NAT are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.         **Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed EoGRE Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability** Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing malformed IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6) Ethernet over Generic Routing Encapsulation (EoGRE) packets on an interface configured with EoGRE.    EoGRE is not enabled by default.  To determine whether EoGRE has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the **tunnel mode ethernet gre ipv4** or ****tunnel mode ethernet gre ipv6**** commands must be present on a tunnel interface configuration and at least one IP address must be configured on that interface.      The **show running-config | include Tunnel|(tunnel mode|ip address .)**  command can be used to determine whether EoGRE is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:  ```   asr1004#show running-config | include Tunnel|(tunnel mode|ip address .) interface Tunnel0 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0    tunnel mode ethernet gre ipv4      ```    **Note:** Cisco IOS devices configured for EoGRE are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.   Determine the Running Software VersionThe Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS XE releases correspond to the Cisco IOS Software releases. For example, Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.2S is the software release for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS Release 15.2(2)S2.   For more information about mappings between the Cisco IOS XE releases and their associated Cisco IOS releases, see the following:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_intro.html>   To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS XE Software is running on a device, administrators can issue the **show version** command. The following example shows Cisco IOS XE Software that is running IOS XE Software version 3.6.2S, which maps to Cisco IOS Software version 15.2(2)S2:    ```   asr1004#show version Cisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.2(2)S2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2012 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Tue 07-Aug-12 13:40 by mcpre      ```    **Note:** A Cisco IOS XE Software image consists of seven individual modules, also referred to as subpackages. The packages are designed to use the In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) capability of Cisco IOS XE Software. Customers can choose to upgrade only those packages that need to be upgraded. For more information about the Cisco IOS XE Software packaging, see the following:   http://www.cisco.com/en/US/partner/prod/collateral/routers/ps9343/product\_bulletin\_c25-448387.html      If the packages are upgraded individually, the output of the **show version** command may vary.      Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe products running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS-XR Software are not affected by any of these vulnerabilities.      With the exception of Cisco IOS XE Software for 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The following section provides additional information about each vulnerability.      **Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**   A vulnerability in the Zone-Based Firewall (ZBFW) TCP or UDP inspection feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed ICMP error packets traversing a vulnerable device that belong to a TCP or UDP connection that is inspected by a ZBFW. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of malformed ICMP error packets that belong to an inspected TCP or UDP session. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtt26470](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtt26470) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5543.         **Cisco IOS XE Software PPTP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability**   A vulnerability in the PPTP ALG feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of PPTP packets that are being inspected as part of the NAT feature on Cisco IOS XE Software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of PPTP packets to traverse a vulnerable system that is configured for NAT.      A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh19936](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh19936) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5545.         **Cisco IOS XE Software TCP Segment Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerability**   A vulnerability in TCP segment reassembly of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of large TCP reassembled packets that are being processed by NAT and ALG features on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a TCP packet that is large after the reassembly to traverse a vulnerable device. Only packets being handled by NAT and ALG features have a potential to cause an affected device to reload. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCud72509](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud72509) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5546.         **Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed EoGRE Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**   A vulnerability in the EoGRE feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed EoGRE packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IPv4 or IPv6 EoGRE packets to an affected device configured with an EoGRE interface; this vulnerability cannot be exploited by sending malformed EoGRE packets to traverse a vulnerable system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuf08269](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf08269) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5547.

| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  **Access Vector**  ---   Local (L) A vulnerability exploitable with only local access requires the attacker to have either physical access to the vulnerable system or a local (shell) account. Examples of locally exploitable vulnerabilities are peripheral attacks such as Firewire/USB DMA attacks, and local privilege escalations (e.g., sudo). Adjacent Network (A) A vulnerability exploitable with adjacent network access requires the attacker to have access to either the broadcast or collision domain of the vulnerable software. Examples of local networks include local IP subnet, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, and local Ethernet segment.  Network (N) A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". An example of a network attack is an RPC buffer overflow.  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  **Access Complexity**  ---   High (H)  Specialized access conditions exist. For example: In most configurations, the attacking party must already have elevated privileges or spoof additional systems in addition to the attacking system (e.g., DNS hijacking). The attack depends on social engineering methods that would be easily detected by knowledgeable people. For example, the victim must perform several suspicious or atypical actions. The vulnerable configuration is seen very rarely in practice. If a race condition exists, the window is very narrow. Medium (M)  The access conditions are somewhat specialized; the following are examples: The attacking party is limited to a group of systems or users at some level of authorization, possibly untrusted. Some information must be gathered before a successful attack can be launched. The affected configuration is non-default, and is not commonly configured (e.g., a vulnerability present when a server performs user account authentication via a specific scheme, but not present for another authentication scheme). The attack requires a small amount of social engineering that might occasionally fool cautious users (e.g., phishing attacks that modify a web browser?s status bar to show a false link, having to be on someone?s ?buddy? list before sending an IM exploit).  Low (L)  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. The following are examples: The affected product typically requires access to a wide range of systems and users, possibly anonymous and untrusted (e.g., Internet-facing web or mail server). The affected configuration is default or ubiquitous. The attack can be performed manually and requires little skill or additional information gathering. The ?race condition? is a lazy one (i.e., it is technically a race but easily winnable).  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  **Authentication**  ---   Multiple (M) Exploiting the vulnerability requires that the attacker authenticate two or more times, even if the same credentials are used each time. An example is an attacker authenticating to an operating system in addition to providing credentials to access an application hosted on that system. Single (S) The vulnerability requires an attacker to be logged into the system (such as at a command line or via a desktop session or web interface).  None (N) Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  **Confidentiality Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. Partial (P) There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. An example is a vulnerability that divulges only certain tables in a database.  Complete (C) There is total information disclosure, resulting in all system files being revealed. The attacker is able to read all of the system's data (memory, files, etc.)  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  **Integrity Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the integrity of the system. Partial (P) Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. For example, system or application files may be overwritten or modified, but either the attacker has no control over which files are affected or the attacker can modify files within only a limited context or scope.  Complete (C) There is a total compromise of system integrity. There is a complete loss of system protection, resulting in the entire system being compromised. The attacker is able to modify any files on the target system.  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete  **Availability Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the availability of the system. Partial (P)There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. An example is a network-based flood attack that permits a limited number of successful connections to an Internet service.  Complete (C) There is a total shutdown of the affected resource. The attacker can render the resource completely unavailable.    Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   **Collateral Damage Potential**  ---   None (N) There is no potential for loss of life, physical assets, productivity or revenue. Low (L) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in slight physical or property damage. Or, there may be a slight loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.  Low-Medium (LM) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in moderate physical or property damage. Or, there may be a moderate loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.  Medium-High (MH) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in significant physical or property damage or loss. Or, there may be a significant loss of revenue or productivity.  High (H) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in catastrophic physical or property damage and loss. Or, there may be a catastrophic loss of revenue or productivity.

Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   **Target Distribution**  ---   None (N) No target systems exist, or targets are so highly specialized that they only exist in a laboratory setting. Effectively 0% of the environment is at risk. Low (L) Targets exist inside the environment, but on a small scale. Between 1% - 25% of the total environment is at risk.  Medium (M) Targets exist inside the environment, but on a medium scale. Between 26% - 75% of the total environment is at risk.  High (H) Targets exist inside the environment on a considerable scale. Between 76% - 100% of the total environment is considered at risk.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   **Confidentiality Requirement**  ---   Low (L): Loss of confidentiality is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  **Access Vector**  ---   Local (L) A vulnerability exploitable with only local access requires the attacker to have either physical access to the vulnerable system or a local (shell) account. Examples of locally exploitable vulnerabilities are peripheral attacks such as Firewire/USB DMA attacks, and local privilege escalations (e.g., sudo). Adjacent Network (A) A vulnerability exploitable with adjacent network access requires the attacker to have access to either the broadcast or collision domain of the vulnerable software. Examples of local networks include local IP subnet, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, and local Ethernet segment.  Network (N) A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". An example of a network attack is an RPC buffer overflow.
