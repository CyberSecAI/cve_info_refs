{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper processing of large TCP reassembled packets by NAT and ALG features on the affected device.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of TCP segment reassembly when NAT is enabled"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.",

      "Sending TCP packets that are large after the segment reassembly to traverse a vulnerable device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to send specifically crafted large TCP packets through a device with NAT enabled."
