Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of error messages within the EC-CUBE application. Specifically, the `displaySystemError` function in `handle_error.php` does not properly sanitize error messages before displaying them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS.  By injecting malicious code into an error message, an attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to execute within a user's browser.
*   **Session Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly detailed, the title of the vulnerability mentions "session information disclosure". This is often a consequence of XSS where a malicious script steals session cookies or tokens. However, the specific method for exploiting session information is not included.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks, such as:
    *   **Data theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
    *   **Account hijacking:** Taking control of user accounts.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or downloading malware.
    *   **Defacement:**  Modifying the appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Error Message Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker can control the content of an error message displayed by the application. The exact means of injecting this malicious content is not specified, but it would likely involve manipulating input to the application in a way that leads to an error condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via network access (internet).
*  **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required in the sense that the user must visit a page that triggers the error condition.

**Specifics:**

*   **Affected Versions:** EC-CUBE versions 2.11.0 to 2.11.5 are vulnerable.
*   **Patch:** The provided patch modifies the `displaySystemError` function by adding `ini_set('display_errors','0');` This disables the display of error messages, preventing the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The JVN analysis indicates the exploit complexity as "Mid-High", implying that some skill or luck might be needed to craft a successful exploit.
*   The severity is rated as "Low" by CVSS v2, which might be due to the need to trigger a specific error condition. The JPCERT/CC analysis rates the severity as High.
