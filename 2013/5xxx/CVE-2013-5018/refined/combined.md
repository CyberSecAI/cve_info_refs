How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Release and vulnerability announcements for strongSwan

* [Blog](/blog/)
* [2013](/blog/2013)
* [strongSwan 5.1.0 Released](/blog/2013/08/01/strongswan-5.1.0-released.html)

## strongSwan 5.1.0 Released

Aug 01, 2013

We are proud to release strongSwan 5.1.0, which brings many new and improved features and fixes a DoS vulnerability.

[release](/blog/tags/release)[5.1.x](/blog/tags/5.1.x)

### Denial-of-Service Vulnerability (CVE-2013-5018)

A denial-of-service vulnerability was fixed that could be triggered by special XAuth usernames and EAP identities (affected by this are 5.0.3 and 5.0.4), and local PEM files (all versions since 4.1.11).

More information is provided in a [separate blog entry](/blog/2013/08/01/strongswan-denial-of-service-vulnerability-%28cve-2013-5018%29.html).

Easy-to-Use *charon-cmd* Command-Line IKE Client

The new [charon-cmd](http://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Charon-cmd) command line IKE client can establish road warrior connections using IKEv1 or IKEv2 with different authentication profiles. It does not depend on any configuration files (no ipsec.conf nor ipsec.secrets but may use strongswan.conf options) and can be configured using a few simple command line options.

### Support of PKCS#12 Private Key/Certificate Container Format

Extraction of certificates and private keys from PKCS#12 file is now provided by the new *pkcs12* plugin or the *openssl* plugin. *charon-cmd* (--p12) as well as charon (via P12 token in ipsec.secrets) can make use of this new functionality.

Support of *ssh-agent* and other Public Key Formats

The *sshkey* plugin parses SSH public keys, which, together with the --agent option for *charon-cmd*, allows the use of *ssh-agent* for authentication.

To configure SSH public keys in ipsec.conf the *left|rightrsasigkey* options are replaced with *left|rightsigkey*, which now take public keys in one of three formats: SSH (RFC 4253, *ssh:* prefix), DNSKEY (RFC 3110, *dns:* prefix), PKCS#1 (the default, no prefix).

Trusted Network Connect (TNC) Policy Manager Interface

Using a SQL database interface, a TNC Policy Manager can generate specific measurement workitems for an arbitrary number of
Integrity Measurement Verifiers (IMVs), based on the history of the individual VPN users and/or client devices.

We are currently working on the documentation and some demo examples for the new Python/Django-based [strongTNC Policy Manager Tool](https://github.com/strongswan/strongTNC) implemented by the HSR students Stefan Rohner and Marco Tanner as part of their Bachelor Thesis.

### IPsec ESP Userland Encryption with *libipsec*

The new *kernel-libipsec* plugin uses TUN devices and *libipsec* to provide IPsec processing in userland on [Linux](uml/testresults/libipsec/net2net-cert/), FreeBSD and Mac OS X.

*libipsec* now supports AES-GCM, which will be automatically accelerated if the *openssl* plugin detects the Intel AES NI instruction set. Thus, *libipsec* is ideally suited for Suite B compliance on Mac OS X where the kernel does not offer ESP AES-GCM support.

### Improvements for Mac OS X and FreeBSD

The *kernel-pfroute* networking backend has been greatly improved. It now can install virtual IPs on TUN devices on Mac OS X and FreeBSD, allowing these systems to act as client in common road warrior scenarios.

The new *osx-attr* plugin installs configuration attributes (currently DNS servers) via SystemConfiguration on Mac OS X. The *keychain* plugin provides certificates from the Mac OS X keychain service.

### Other Notable Changes

* The *eap-radius* plugin can now serve as an XAuth backend called *xauth-radius*, directly verifying XAuth credentials using RADIUS User-Name/User-Password attributes.
* IKEv2 can now negotiate transport mode and IPComp in NAT situations.
* IKEv2 exchange initiators now properly close an established IKE or CHILD\_SA on error conditions using an additional exchange, keeping state in sync between peers.
* Protocol and port can be specified for each individual subnet specified with the *left|rightsubnet* ipsec.conf options.
* The *closeaction* option is now also supported for IKEv1.
* The *leak-detective* developer tool has been improved. It works much faster and more stable with multiple threads, does not use deprecated malloc hooks anymore and has been ported to Mac OS X.
* chunk\_hash() is now based on [SipHash-2-4](https://131002.net/siphash/) with a random key. This provides better distribution and prevents hash flooding attacks when used with hashtables.
* All default plugins implement the get\_features() method to define features and their dependencies. The plugin loader has been improved, so that plugins in a custom load statement can be ordered freely or to express preferences without being affected by dependencies between plugin features.
* A centralized thread can take care of watching multiple file descriptors concurrently. This removes the need for dedicated listener threads in various plugins. The number of "reserved" threads for such tasks has been reduced to about five, depending on the plugin configuration.
* Plugins that can be controlled by a UNIX socket IPC mechanism gained network transparency. Third party applications querying these plugins now can use TCP connections from a different host.
* Several core classes in *libstrongswan* are now tested with unit tests.

* [strongSwan Denial-of-Service Vulnerability (CVE-2013-5018)](/blog/2013/08/01/strongswan-denial-of-service-vulnerability-%28cve-2013-5018%29.html)

## strongSwan Denial-of-Service Vulnerability (CVE-2013-5018)

Aug 01, 2013

A DoS vulnerability in strongSwan was discovered, which is triggered by XAuth usernames and EAP identities in versions 5.0.3 and 5.0.4.

[4.x](/blog/tags/4.x)[5.0.x](/blog/tags/5.0.x)[security fix](/blog/tags/security%2Bfix)

A recent [bug report](http://lists.strongswan.org/pipermail/users/2013-July/009540.html) on one of our mailing lists lead to the discovery of a denial-of-service vulnerability in strongSwan ([CVE-2013-5018](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2013-5018)).

It can be triggered by specially crafted XAuth usernames and EAP identities. Affected are the *xauth-generic* and *xauth-eap* plugins as well as the following EAP plugins: *eap-aka, eap-identity, eap-peap, eap-sim, eap-ttls*. Also affected are the SASL implementation in *libpttls* and the *tnc-pdp* plugin. A crash can also be triggered locally by a crafted PEM encoded file. Injecting code is not possible by such attacks.

### XAuth / EAP Issue

A segmentation fault is caused if an XAuth username or EAP identity is received that starts with either 0 or 1 (ASCII, 0x30 and 0x31 hex,
technically 0x04 also triggers it, but this is harder to craft) and whose remaining bytes can be interpreted as single- or multi-byte ASN.1
length (for instance, a single character < 0x80). An example for such a username is *15* (0x3135) as can be seen in the bug report.

The plugins listed above call identification\_create\_from\_data() to parse the username/identity, which first calls is\_asn1() to determine if the given data is ASN.1 encoded. This function in turn calls asn1\_length() but handles the return value incorrectly, if the parsed ASN.1 length is invalid (e.g. if the parsed length is longer than the actual data). If the remaining data length is exactly zero, a check for terminating newlines causes an integer overflow and subsequently a segmentation fault.

strongSwan versions 5.0.3 and 5.0.4 are affected by this issue.

### PEM Issue

Because the vulnerable function (is\_asn1) is also called by the *pem*plugin, a similar bug can be triggered locally by a specifically crafted PEM encoded file that starts with either 0x04, 0x30, or 0x31 and follows the structure described above. Since this plugin is only used to load local certificate, private key or CRL files, which can't be changed without proper privileges, the severity of this issue is minor.

All strongSwan versions since 4.1.11 are affected by this issue. In releases before 4.3.0 pluto's own ASN.1 parser is also affected.

### Earlier Releases, X.509 Patch

While is\_asn1() never handled the return value of asn1\_length() correctly, this did not cause any problems before the additional check for newlines was added with 4.1.11. Therefore, earlier releases as well as users of the original X.509 patch for FreeS/WAN (Openswan, Libreswan) are **not** vulnerable.

### Fix

The just released [strongSwan 5.1.0](/blog/2013/08/01/strongswan-5.1.0-released.html) fixes this vulnerability. For older releases we [provide two patches](http://download.strongswan.org/security/CVE-2013-5018/), one for versions since 4.3.0 the other for versions before that.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
