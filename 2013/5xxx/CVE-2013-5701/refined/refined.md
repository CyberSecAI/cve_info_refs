Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-5701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Insecure library loading in Watchguard Server Center's "Watchguard Log Collector" and "Watchguard WebBlocker Server" services. These services load DLLs from their respective application directories using a fixed path, without properly validating the legitimacy of these DLLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The applications load libraries (specifically `wgpr.dll`) from their local application directory (`bin` subdirectory), before checking the legitimate location.
- **Insecure Library Loading:** The applications do not verify the integrity or source of the loaded libraries, allowing an attacker to substitute a malicious DLL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged attacker can gain SYSTEM privileges by placing a malicious DLL (`wgpr.dll`) in the application's `bin` directory. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, effectively taking control of the system.
- The attacker can execute any command as SYSTEM, as demonstrated with `calc.exe`.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system running the vulnerable Watchguard services.
- **File system manipulation:** The attacker must be able to write files to the `bin` directory of the vulnerable services (wlcollector.exe and wbserver.exe).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local user account:** The attacker must have a user account on the target system.
- **Write access (depending on the install directory):** In a non-default installation or on Windows XP, the attacker needs write access to the applicationâ€™s `bin` directory. On default installations on Windows Vista and above, permissions might be restricted, but still exploitable with the correct user rights.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vulnerable services run with SYSTEM privileges, making exploitation highly impactful.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the service starts or restarts after the attacker places the malicious `wgpr.dll`
- The malicious `wgpr.dll` needs at least one exported function, in this case `wgpr_library_get` to be loaded successfully.

- **Mitigation:** Hardening directory permissions on the application's `bin` folder to prevent low-privileged users from writing files.
- The vendor did not initially provide an email address to report vulnerabilities, causing issues during the vulnerability disclosure process.
