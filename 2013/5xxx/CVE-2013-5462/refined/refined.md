- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Content Navigator application allows itself to be opened within a frame in a web page, which can be exploited by a malicious actor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Clickjacking vulnerability. The application does not have proper protection against being embedded in a frame, allowing an attacker to potentially record user input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can record user input, potentially capturing sensitive information like login credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening the IBM Content Navigator application URL within a frame on a malicious webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to embed the vulnerable application within a frame on a webpage they control and trick a user into interacting with it.
