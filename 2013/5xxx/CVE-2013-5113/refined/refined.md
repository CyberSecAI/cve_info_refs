Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way LastPass for Android (versions 2.0.4 and prior) implemented its PIN protection and auto-wipe feature in conjunction with Android's backup and restore functionality via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). Specifically, the `android:allowBackup` attribute was set to 'true' in the `AndroidManifest.xml`, allowing backups to be created via ADB.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Backup Mechanism:**  The LastPass app's data, including settings related to PIN protection, was included in ADB backups.
2.  **Lack of Data Protection During Backup/Restore:** The backed-up data, stored in an XML file (`LPandroid.xml`), was not encrypted or protected, allowing an attacker to extract and modify it.
3.  **Bypassing PIN Protection:** The attacker could modify the `LPandroid.xml` file by removing the `passwordrepromptonactive`, `pincodeforreprompt`, and `requirepin` values, effectively disabling PIN protection.
4.  **Bypassing Auto-wipe:** By manipulating the  `reprompt_tries` value in the same XML file, the attacker could bypass the 10 incorrect PIN attempts limit and prevent the auto-wipe of application data.
5. **Cloning the Application**: By restoring the modified backup to a secondary device, an attacker can potentially maintain access to the user's LastPass data even if the user changes their passwords, as changes are synced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Account Takeover:** Attackers could gain access to the victim's LastPass vault, including all usernames and passwords.
*   **Data Theft:**  Attackers could steal sensitive data stored within LastPass.
*   **Persistent Access:** The attacker can maintain access to the user's lastpass account, even if the user changes passwords due to the cloned application syncing changes from lastpass servers.
*   **Bypassed security measures**: PIN protection and auto-wipe functionality are completely bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the target Android device.
*   **ADB Enabled:** USB debugging (ADB) must be enabled on the Android device.
*   **ADB Backup/Restore:** The attacker uses the ADB tool to back up, modify, and restore the LastPass app's data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical access to the device.**
*   **Basic understanding of ADB and command line.**
*   **Ability to enable USB debugging on the device.**
*   **Ability to use tools to unpack/pack Android backup files (e.g. `ab_unpacker.py`).**
*   **Knowledge of XML structure of the Lastpass application data.**
