Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-5528:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within a specific function of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) Administrative Web Interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. This means an attacker can manipulate input parameters to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The web interface does not adequately validate user-provided file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to read the content of any file accessible to the Apache Tomcat service account. This includes potentially sensitive system files.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could obtain sensitive information from configuration files, system logs, or other files on the CUCM server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is located within the CUCM's administrative web interface.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web interface. Specifically, the `bulkvivewfilecontents.do` endpoint with a modified `fileName` parameter.
*   **Directory Traversal Sequences:** The attack uses directory traversal sequences such as `../../` in the `fileName` parameter to move up the file system tree and access arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the CUCM administrative web interface before exploiting the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CUCM server to send the malicious HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 9.1(1) and prior are confirmed to be vulnerable. Later versions may also be affected.
*   **Fixed Versions:** Cisco has addressed the vulnerability in versions 9.1.2, 10.5.2, and 11.5.x.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory).

**Example Exploit:**

```
http://justpentest.com/ccmadmin/bulkvivewfilecontents.do?filetype=samplefile&fileName=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```
This example shows an attacker attempting to read the `/etc/passwd` file using directory traversal.
