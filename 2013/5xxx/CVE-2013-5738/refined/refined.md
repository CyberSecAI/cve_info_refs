Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-5738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient capability checks when uploading `.html` or `.htm` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** Authenticated users, even with limited permissions, could upload HTML files, which can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Missing Security Restrictions:** The system did not properly restrict upload of `.html` and `.htm` files, allowing potentially malicious content to be introduced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By uploading malicious HTML files, attackers could inject arbitrary scripts that execute in the browsers of other users who access the uploaded content. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** Attackers would upload specially crafted HTML files via the WordPress media upload functionality.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attack vector requires an authenticated user but does not require administrator level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs an account on the WordPress site.
*   **Basic Permissions:**  The attacker needs the capability to upload files, which is available to roles with low level privileges like author roles.
*   **Malicious File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious HTML file with an XSS payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves restricting the upload of `.html` and `.htm` files unless the user has the `unfiltered_html` capability, indicating higher privileges.
*   This vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 3.6.1, which is a security update for previous WordPress versions.
