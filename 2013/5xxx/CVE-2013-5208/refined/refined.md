- **Root cause of vulnerability:** HR Systems Strategies info:HR HRIS stores database credentials in a registry key that allows read access to any local user. The database password is weakly obfuscated with a static key and can be easily deciphered.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cleartext Storage in the Registry (CWE-314)
    - Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)
    - Weak obfuscation of database password using a static key.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can read and decipher the SQL database password, gaining complete control over the database and the info:HR application, including access to sensitive personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the Windows system where info:HR is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local user access to the Windows system where the info:HR application is installed and access to the registry.
