Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the IBM FileNet Business Process Framework's susceptibility to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. The embedded component used by IBM BPM document store is also affected by this.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the improper handling of XML input, specifically the lack of sanitization or restriction of external entities. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML payloads containing external entity references.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful XXE attack can allow a remote attacker to:
*   Obtain sensitive information from the server. This is confirmed by the description that the vulnerability could lead to obtaining sensitive information which could then be used to launch further attacks against the system.
*   Potentially access local files or resources that the server has access to. This is implied by the general nature of XXE attacks but is not explicitly confirmed in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted XML request sent to the vulnerable application. The provided example shows how an attacker can include a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration with an `<!ENTITY>` that references an external system using the `SYSTEM` keyword. The attacker then uses the created entity in a part of the XML request that is parsed by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable BPF/BPM server.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`/bpf/dispatchAction` in the provided example).
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious XML request containing the XXE payload.
*   The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker needs to have some sort of authentication (`Au:S`)

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered in IBM's Business Process Framework (BPF), specifically version 4.1.0.7 and impacts IBM BPM (Business Process Manager).
*   The vulnerability was addressed in BPF-4.1.0-010.
*   The vulnerability also affects IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5.0 and V8.5.6.0, which requires the application of a separate interim fix (APAR JR53843).
*   The vulnerability is also tracked by APAR PJ40949
* The CVSS score for the vulnerability is 3.5 with a vector of (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N)
