The provided content is related to **CVE-2013-5120** and **CVE-2013-5121**, as it explicitly mentions both CVEs. It describes SQL injection vulnerabilities found in PHPFox 3.6.0 (build3).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input within the `search[gender]` and `search[sort_by]` parameters, which are directly incorporated into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of blind SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `search[gender]` and `search[sort_by]` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially:
- Manipulate query results
- Extract sensitive information from the database
- Modify data within the database
- Potentially achieve remote code execution depending on the database and privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending POST requests to `/user/browse/view_/` with malicious SQL injection payloads in the `search[gender]` and `search[sort_by]` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability stems from inadequate input sanitization.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, including:
- The specific vulnerable parameters: `search[gender]` and `search[sort_by]`.
- Proof-of-concept payloads for both vulnerable parameters.
- Information that builds 4 and 5 also contain the vulnerability present in the `search[sort_by]` parameter but not the `search[gender]` one.
- The exact vulnerable version of PHPFox and the patched version.
- A timeline of the vulnerability reporting and fix.
