Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2013-5057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because a Microsoft Office shared component was not built to properly implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). This allows an attacker to predict memory offsets more reliably.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper implementation of ASLR in a Microsoft Office shared component. This is a security feature bypass vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass the ASLR security feature.
- Bypassing ASLR does not directly allow arbitrary code execution, but it makes it easier for an attacker to exploit another vulnerability, like a remote code execution vulnerability, by providing reliable memory addresses.
- This bypass can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability, which could then lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack scenario: An attacker hosts a website with specially crafted content to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites accepting user-provided content or ads.
- Email Attachments: Attackers can trick users into opening malicious attachments sent via email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage or compromise a website.
- The user must visit the attacker-controlled webpage via a web browser that can instantiate COM components, such as Internet Explorer.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious content, typically through a link in an email or instant message.
- The attacker needs knowledge of how to exploit ASLR bypass and potentially another vulnerability to achieve code execution.
