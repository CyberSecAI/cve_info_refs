Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the NBAP (Node B Application Part) dissector of Wireshark. The dissector does not properly validate the `dch_id` value, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of proper bounds checking or validation of the `dch_id` value within the NBAP dissector. This allows a malformed packet with an invalid `dch_id` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is the ability to crash Wireshark. This can disrupt network analysis activities by making the tool unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Packet Injection:** An attacker could inject a specifically crafted, malformed NBAP packet onto the network. When Wireshark attempts to dissect this packet, it crashes.
*   **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can create a malicious capture file containing the malformed NBAP packet. When a user opens this file in Wireshark, the application crashes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access/Traffic Injection:** For real-time attacks, the attacker needs to be able to inject packets onto the network being monitored by Wireshark.
*   **File Sharing/Social Engineering:** Alternatively, the attacker could send a crafted pcap file to the victim, using social engineering tactics, and the victim opens it with Wireshark.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker would need some understanding of the NBAP protocol and Wireshark to craft a malicious packet that triggers the flaw.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Laurent Butti.
*   The issue is identified as "wnpa-sec-2013-55" in Wireshark's security advisories.
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.10.0 to 1.10.1 and 1.8.0 to 1.8.9.
*   It was fixed in Wireshark versions 1.10.2 and 1.8.10.
*   The fix included limiting the values of `dch_id` as seen in the `nbap.diff` patch file.
*   Multiple Linux distributions (openSUSE and Debian) released security updates to address this vulnerability.
