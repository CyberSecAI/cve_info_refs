    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, or partial compromise of these aspects, depending on the specific vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks via Java applets or Java Web Start applications.",
      "Direct API access without sandboxed applications (server deployment)."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to entice a user to run a specially crafted Java applet or Java Web Start application or to supply malicious data to the vulnerable API.",
    "additional_details": "The CVSS scores provided assume administrator privileges, which is typical in Windows environments. In systems like Solaris and Linux where users typically don't run with admin privileges, the impact scores are reduced."
