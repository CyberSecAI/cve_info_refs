Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a weakness in the default configuration of WordPress that allowed the upload of `.swf` (Shockwave Flash) and `.exe` (executable) files. These file types can contain malicious code, including scripts, that could be executed when accessed by a user in the context of the WordPress site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Uploads:** The primary weakness is the lack of restrictions on potentially dangerous file types during upload. By default, WordPress was configured to allow `.swf` and `.exe` files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allowed authenticated users to upload malicious `.swf` and `.exe` files. These files, when executed in a user's browser, could enable cross-site scripting attacks. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   User redirection
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the website
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** While not explicitly mentioned in all sources, executable (.exe) files could potentially lead to remote code execution on the user's machine if executed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** Attackers could upload malicious .swf and .exe files through the WordPress media upload functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needed to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site with the ability to upload files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved modifying the `get_allowed_mime_types()` function in `wp-includes/functions.php` to remove `swf` and `exe` from the allowed mime types.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 3.6.1.
*   The fix also prevents the upload of `.html` and `.htm` unless the user has the 'unfiltered\_html' capability to prevent XSS attacks.
