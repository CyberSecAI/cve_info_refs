Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-20004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The iSCSI service does not limit the number of connection attempts from a client initiator when the target is non-existent. This leads to a memory leak on each connection attempt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of resource management: The service does not properly manage connection attempts, particularly when connections fail.
- Memory leak: Repeated connection attempts to a non-existent target cause memory exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The memory leak can lead to the iSCSI Target becoming non-functional due to the exhaustion of server memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is triggered via network connection attempts from an iSCSI initiator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: An attacker needs to be able to initiate iSCSI connections to the vulnerable server.
- Knowledge of non-existent targets: The attacker needs to know, or be able to manipulate, an iSCSI initiator to connect to a non-existent target.
