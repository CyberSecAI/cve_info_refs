# Updated Themify Framework to fix the vulnerability

[Blog](https://themify.me/blog) [Development](https://themify.me/blog/development)

In an effort to resolve the [vulnerability issue](https://themify.me/blog/urgent-vulnerability-found-in-themify-framework-please-read) found in the older versions of Themify framework before 1.2.2, we've released a new update which will delete the legacy file 'themify-ajax.php' and any unknown files in the theme 'uploads' folder. This update (framework 1.6.3) is intended to save your time from removing the legacy file manually as posted [here](https://themify.me/blog/how-to-deal-with-vulnerability-in-old-themify-framework-versions). Themify users are recommended to upgrade to this version. To [upgrade](https://themify.me/docs/upgrading) your theme/framework, go to the Themify option panel page and you should see the upgrade notice. After the update, please verify if the file 'themify-ajax.php' still exists by checking the file list in WP Admin > Appearance > Editor. You may also use a [FTP](https://themify.me/docs/ftp) software to check the file in 'wp-content > themes > [themify\_folder] > themify' folder.

**NOTE:** this vulnerability issue only affects the themes installed with Themify framework version before 1.2.2, released on November 9, 2012. Even if your theme is not affected, it's recommended that you update to this new version.

**REMEMBER:** if you have any inactive/old Themify theme sitting on the server, download the theme(s) to your computer for backup and delete it on your server. This fix will only apply to the active Themify theme.

   “…delete the legacy file ‘themify-ajax.php’ and any unknown files in the theme ‘uploads’ folder”

   Will this update delete images I have put there before?

   One more thing…

   The Themify Banners & Links widget use some images in the theme uploads folder. It’s icons for YouTube, Facebook etc.

   Problem, no problem? How do I move theme if it’s a problem.

   Hi Anders, the images you’ve uploaded will be perfectly fine, they won’t be deleted.

   Help! There’s no upgrade notice on my dashboard. I’m using elemin 1.4.2 and framework 1.5.9. Should I reload elemin?

     If you don’t see the upgrade notice, you may also upgrade with FTP or reinstall it using the WordPress upload: <https://themify.me/docs/upgrading#ftp>.

    Thanks for the quick answer. So should I reinstall elemin? Will that upgrade the framework too? Sorry but I don’t know very much about this stuff. I watched the video about how to upgrade so I’m good to go on the how, I just don’t know what to install.

    I got an email from my host this morning saying that they’ve removed permissions from index.php because it was using too much processor time – presumably because someone has exploited the vulnerability in themify-ajax.php. I tried to update the theme using WordPress, but the page just stopped responding whenever I clicked ‘update’. So I’ve backed up the theme to my hard drive, deleted it from the server using an FTP program, and uploaded the latest version from Themify.

    Will that sort out the problem, or do I need to do more? Presumably the hackers have uploaded something. How do I find out what? I’ve asked my hosting company but haven’t had a reply yet.

    I hope you can help me.

      You can upgrade the theme using a FTP software: <https://themify.me/docs/upgrading#ftp>. Check the theme ‘uploads’ folder for any PHP or unknown file. Remove them if you see any suspicious file. If you need further help, please contact us: <https://themify.me/contact>

# URGENT: Vulnerability Found in Themify Framework, Please Read

[Blog](https://themify.me/blog) [Development](https://themify.me/blog/development)

Hello Themify users,

We have recently received and confirmed reports of a vulnerability that exists within the Themify framework, and we would like to shed some light on the situation and ensure that you take the proper steps to protect yourself from this vulnerability.

### The Low Down

In older versions of Themify framework, we used to include an unsecure file called 'themify-ajax.php', that was fixed and removed in framework **version 1.2.2**, released on **November 9, 2012**. However, users that upgraded through the auto-upgrader did not have this file removed from their server, and we have recently received several reports of intruders using ‘themify-ajax.php’ to upload files to users servers.

### Am I Affected?

This vulnerability only affects users that installed a Themify theme with framework version before 1.2.2, released on November 9, 2012 (you can find the [changelogs](https://themify.me/logs/framework-changelogs) here).

To be absolutely sure, check for the file 'themify-ajax.php' on your server by following these steps:

* connect to your [FTP](https://themify.me/docs/ftp) server
* from the root WordPress folder, go to 'wp-content' folder
* go to 'themes' folder
* go to [themify\_theme\_folder]
* go to 'themify' folder
* and check for the 'themify-ajax.php' file (note that the 'themify-wpajax.php' is the fixed version in 1.2.2)

If you can’t find it, you’re safe.

However, if you see it, you will have to download the latest theme from the [member dashboard](https://themify.me/member) and replace entire theme folder. Here is a [tutorial](https://themify.me/docs/upgrading#ftp) on how to use FTP to replace the theme folder. **You must absolutely do this in order to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited on your website.**

### What next?

Once you have replaced your theme folder entirely, you are safe. If you are unsure and need help, please [contact us](https://themify.me/contact) immediately and we will respond as soon as possible.

We know that this vulnerability is an inconvenience and an issue that should never have happened in the first place, and we’re very sorry that it did. We hope that you can trust us to make issues like this known as soon as possible, and to have a solution in place for all of our users.

As we mentioned, please do not hesitate to contact us with any concerns or support requests. We will do our best to respond as soon as possible during this very important time.

Thank you so much for using Themify.

### Update (Nov 13, 2013):

Please read [this post](https://themify.me/blog/how-to-deal-with-vulnerability-in-old-themify-framework-versions) for more detail on how to remove the legacy file 'themify-ajax.php'.

### Updated Fix (Nov 14, 2013):

We've released a new framework update to fix this issue. Please read this [post](https://themify.me/blog/updated-themify-framework-to-fix-the-vulnerability) and upgrade your theme.

   So to completely sure:

   ‘themify-ajax.php’ = bad

   ‘themify-wpajax.php’ = good

   Right?

     Technically, correct. If you don’t see the ‘themify-ajax.php’ file, no actions required.

   Is there an easy way to neutralize the threat without updating the theme?

   In our case we use a themify theme (Pinboard) as a parent theme and the child theme is heavily reliant on the parent, such that updating the themify theme breaks a lot of stuff.

     Wrong concept. If you understand what’s the difference between a parent theme and a child theme, you won’t afraid to update. Any customization need to be made to the child theme. Therefore, in case that the parent theme need to be updated, the customization made on the child theme will not not lose.

     There have been a few times when themify upgrades actually changed the HTML being output by the parent theme, such that my child theme customizations only half worked after the update… Or a page template file that I customized became outdated. It would be helpful to know if there is a way to upgrade the framework only. This is kind of standard faire when working with themes – not really a surprise.

   If you’re using the Responz theme, can you replace everything BUT the /uploads dir? Wiping out the entire folder and replacing it with an updated directory would wipe out any customizations would it not?

   I’m referencing these instructions:

   “However, if you see it, you will have to download the latest theme from the member dashboard and replace entire theme folder. You must absolutely do this in order to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited on your website.”
