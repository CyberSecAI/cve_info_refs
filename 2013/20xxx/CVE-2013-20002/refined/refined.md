**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could use the vulnerable `themify-ajax.php` file to upload malicious files to the server.
- Successful exploitation could lead to various impacts, including:
  - Website compromise
  - Data theft
  - Server resource abuse (as indicated by one user's hosting provider limiting `index.php` permissions due to excessive processor usage)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable `themify-ajax.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
