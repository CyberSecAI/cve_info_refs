Abstract—  The  Z-Wave  wireless  communication  protocol  has
been  widely  used  in  home  automation  and  wireless  sensors
networks.  Z-Wave  is  based  on  a  proprietary  design  and  a  sole
chip  vendor.  There  have  been  a  number  of  academic  and
practical security researches on home automation systems based
on  ZigBee  and  X10  protocols,  however,  no  public  vulnerability
research on Z-Wave could be found prior to this work.

In this paper, we analyze the Z-Wave protocol stack layers and
design a radio packet capture device and related software named
Z-Force  to  intercept  Z-Wave  communications.    This  device
enables us to decode different layers of the Z-Wave protocol and
study  the
implementation  of  encryption  and  data  origin
authentication  in  the  application  layer.  We  then  present  the
details  of  a  vulnerability  discovered  using  Z-Force  tool  in  AES
encrypted  Z-Wave  door  locks  that  can  be  remotely  exploited  to
unlock doors without the knowledge of the encryption keys.

I. INTRODUCTION
Home automation systems provide a centralized control and
monitoring
for  heating,  ventilation  and  air
conditioning  (HVAC),  lighting  and  physical  security  systems.
The central  control panel and  various  household devices  such
as  security  sensors  and  alarm  systems  are  connected  to  each
other  to  form  a  mesh  network  over  wireless  or  wired
communication  links  and  act  as  a  “smart  home”.  The  first
generation  of  home  automation  systems  such  as  X10  used
existing  power  lines  in  the  buildings  as  the  communication
medium,  but  as  well  as  limited  bandwidth,  they  were
susceptible  to  signal  loss  and  electrical  interference.  Wireless
home  automation  systems  overcome  these  limitations  of  the
power
line  systems  and  provide  easier  expansion  and
interconnectivity  of  different  devices.  However,  as  the  radio
packets  can  be  easily  intercepted  or  injected  by  the  attackers,
integrity  of  wireless
protecting
communication  is  of  great  importance  in  these  systems.  As
such,  security  services  such  as  key  establishment,  encryption,
frame  integrity  protection  and  device  authentication  were
included  in  the  specifications of  open  wireless  protocols  such
as ZigBee. Although these security services are built on top of
the  recognized  cryptographic  algorithms  such  as  Advanced
Encryption  Algorithm  (AES),  successful  attacks  against  them
have  been  demonstrated  that  exploit  the  implementation
vulnerabilities or insecure key management practices [1] [2].

the  confidentiality  and

Z-Wave  protocol  developed  by  Sigma  Designs,  Inc.
provides  packet  encryption,  integrity  protection  and  device
authentication  services  and  is  gaining  momentum  against

ZigBee  protocol  with  regards  to  home  automation.  This  is
partly  due  to  interoperability  of  devices  and  shorter  time  to
market  on  the  vendor  side.  Another  benefit  is  that  it  is  less
subjected  to  signal  interference  compared  to  the  ZigBee
protocol,  which  operates  on  the  widely  populated  2.4  GHz
band  shared  by  both  Bluetooth  and  Wi-Fi  devices.  The
protocol specification and software development kit (SDK) [4]
are  not  open  and  only  available  to  the  device  manufacturers
(OEMs)  who  have  signed  an  NDA  with  Sigma  Designs.  The
SDK  costs  between  1500  to  3500  US  dollars  and  the  NDA
prevents  OEMs  from  disclosing  the  content  of  the  SDK
publically.  The  aim  of  this  research  is  to  build  a  low  cost  Z-
Wave  packet  capture  and  injection  tool  which  facilitates  the
security  testing  of  home  automation  systems  as  well  as  aides
vulnerability discovery of the Z-wave security products such as
access control systems and door locks.

II. Z-WAVE PROTOCOL STACK ANALYSIS
Z-Wave  operates  in  the  Industrial,  Scientific  and  Medical
radio  frequency  band  (ISM).  It  transmits  on  868.42  MHz
(Europe)  and  908.42  MHz  (United  States)  frequencies
designed for low-bandwidth data communications in embedded
devices such as security sensors, alarms and home automation
control  panels.  An  open  source  implementation  of  Z-Wave
protocol  stack,  open-zwave  [4],  is  available  but  it  does  not
support the security services as of yet.

Figure 1 - Z-Wave protocol layers

The open-zwave software uses a Z-Wave controller device
as  the  radio  modem  to  communicate  with  the  network  nodes.
The controller devices can only manage one Z-Wave network
at  a  given  time  identified  by  a  unique  32  bits  Home  ID.  The
Home  ID  value  is  written  to the  controller’s  Z-Wave  chip  by

the  manufacturer  and  cannot  be  changed  by  the  controller
software.  This  prevents  controller  devices  from  tuning  into
neighbor  Z-Wave  networks.  Furthermore,  the  firmware  of
controller  devices  did  not  support  promiscuous  mode  to
intercept  Z-Wave  network  packets  of  its  own  home  network.
These  limitations  led  us  to  build  our  own  Z-Wave  radio
modem  for  the  purpose  of  this  research  as  outlined  in  the
following section.

specifications

The  ITU-T  recommendation  G.9959  [5]  contains  physical
radio
and  MAC
communication including the Z-Wave protocol. It also outlines
some  aspects  of  the  Z-Wave  transport  layer  such  as  frame
formats and Beam control which is necessary to communicate
with Z-Wave door locks.

We  used  the  Texas  Instruments  CC1110  radio  transceiver
kit  [6]  that  comes  with  SmartRF  Studio  [7]  software  to
determine  the  radio  configuration  parameters  required  by  the
CC1110 chip in order to receive and transmit Z-Wave packets
with 9.6 Kbps and 40 Kbps data transfer rates.

The  above  parameters  were  used  to  implement  Z-Wave
physical layer in CC1110 chip firmware and to develop a low
cost Z-Wave packet interception and injection tool, which  we
named  as  Z-Force.  It  is  worth  noting  that  there  were  some
discrepancies between RF signal properties specified in ITU.T
G.9959  and  those  listed  in  the  table  above.  In  order  to
communicate with the devices available to us, we observed the
modulation scheme for 9.6 kbps data rate needs to be G-FSK.
In addition to that we noticed the symbol polarity is inverted in
40  kbps  profile  which  means  all  the  frame  bits  have  to  be
inverted before transmission or after receipt of a frame. Some

this action in hardware. For more information on the individual

B. Transport Layer

layer

Z-Wave

transport

is  mainly

responsible

for
retransmission, packet acknowledgment, waking up low power
network  nodes  (Beaming)  and  packet  origin  authentication.
Each Z-Wave frame in this layer contains the 32 bits Home ID
that  identifies  the  associated  Z-Wave  network,  8  bits  source
node  ID,  frame  header  that  defines  frame  type  (single-cast,
multi-cast,  routed)  and  control  flag  such  as  low  power
transmission,  8  bits  payload  length  followed  by  the  payload
and the 8 bits frame checksum value.  Transport layer relies on
a  frame  checksum  value  to  detect  and  discard  erroneous
frames.  The  Z-Wave  protocol  uses  the  following  checksum
algorithm from the ITU-T G.9959 standard:

BYTE GenCheckSum(BYTE *Data,BYTE Length){
   BYTE CheckSum = 0xFF;
   for (; Length > 0; Length--){
   CheckSum ^= *Data++;}
return CheckSum;}

An overview of Z-Wave transport frame format and fields
is  shown  in  figure  2.  Frame  retransmission  occurs  when  an
acknowledgement frame was not received from the destination
node  before  the  frame  expiration  time.  Beam  frames  that  are
used to wake up battery powered Z-Wave nodes are controlled
by the transport layer. Some battery powered Z-Wave devices
including  door  locks  needs  to  listen  for  the  incoming
commands from the network controller, but keeping their radio
on  will  drain  the  battery  quickly.  In  order  to  preserve  the
battery  power,  the  device  enters  sleep  mode  and  periodically
turns  on  its  radio,  looking  for  beam  frames.  The  transmitting
node  sends  several  back  to  back  beam  frames  in  100ms
intervals  to  ensure  that  the  sleeping  device  will  notice  one  of
those  frames  when  waking  up  and  therefore  it  will  keep  its
radio on to receive subsequent transmissions.

Figure 3 –Z-Wave frame format in different layers

When  in  secure  transmission  mode,  an  8-byte  frame
authentication  header  is  added  to  the  end  of  the  frame  just
before  the  frame  checksum  filed.  No public  specifications for
the Z-Wave origin authentication header were available before
our  research.  By  using  Z-Force  tool  and  performing  binary
code  analysis  of  a  Z-Wave  controller  appliance  firmware  we
found the cryptographic algorithm and parameters to calculate
this  header  value.  Z-Wave  data  origin  authentication  and
encryption algorithms are discussed in detail in section III.
C. Network Layer

the

Z-Wave protocol forms a  mesh network  with one primary
controller device and up to 232 nodes each of which can act as
a  packet  repeater  –  with  the  exception  of  battery  powered
nodes  –
two
to  route  Z-Wave  data  even  when
communicating  parties  cannot  establish  a  direct  radio  link
between  each  other.  In  order  to  determine  the  best  route  to  a
destination node, each device in the Z-Wave network maintains
a  network  topology  that  indicates  all  other  devices  in
proximity. When device locations at home changes or they are
removed  from  the  network,  this  topology  can  become  wrong
and cause routing issues in the network. The Z-Wave protocol
supports  automatic  topology  discovery  and  healing  to  detect
new  network  location  and  routes  and  optimize  the  routing
tables.  Although,  Z-Wave  routing  mechanism  and  topology
discovery  might  be  subjected  to  attacks  such  as  unauthorized
modification of routing tables by rouge nodes [8], we did not
perform  security  tests  in  network  layer,  as  our  research  was
focused  on  the  encryption  and  origin  authentication  that  are
handled by transport and application layers.
D. Application Layer

This layer is responsible for parsing the frame payload and
decoding  the  Z-Wave  commands  and  supplied  parameters.  If
the  node  was  a  Z-Wave  controller  device  the  decoded
command  and  associated  parameters  will  be  forwarded  to  the
controller  software  running  on  the  home  control  computer  or
appliance.  Otherwise  they  will  be  processed  by  the  device
firmware that is developed using Z-Wave SDK and running on
the  Z-Wave  chip.  As  demonstrated  in  figure  2,  the  payload
frame starts with one byte command header specifying that the
command  is  single/multi  or  broadcast  followed  by  the
command  class.  Z-Wave  command  classes  define  device
functionality  such  as  door  lock,  alarm  sensor,  binary  sensor,
heating thermostat and etc. Each command class can consist of

multiple
instance,
COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM  (defined  as  0x71)  includes
CMD_GET  (0x04)  and  CMD_REPORT  (0x05),  the  first  of
which  is  sent by  the  controller  to the  alarm  to  get  the current
state of the alarm and the second one is sent to the controller
when the alarm is triggered. The open-zwave project has listed
command  class  and  command  codes  for  various  Z-Wave
devices. It’s important to note that this list does not contain the
commands  processed  by  Z-Wave  firmware  such  as  network
topology  discovery  or  network
inclusion  and  exclusion
commands.

Using the Z-Force tool we noticed that when home network
nodes communicate over secure Z-Wave, the frame payload is
encrypted  and  followed  by  8  bytes  authentication  field.  The
feature list of the Z-Wave door lock stated that it was using 128
bits AES encryption, but we observed that the encrypted frame
payload  length  is  less  than  the  cipher block  length  (128 bits).
This  suggested  that  the  device  has  AES  algorithm  in  one  of
Cipher Feedback (CFB) or Output Feedback (OFB) modes that
can convert block ciphers to variable length stream ciphers. In
the following section we validate this hypothesis as well as the
frame authentication algorithm.

In  order

III. VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
implementation
to  discover  design  or
vulnerabilities  in  Z-Wave  secure  communication,  it  was
essential  to  uncover  the  details  of  frame  encryption  and
authentication  algorithms.  We  analysed  the  Z-Wave  radio
frames and firmware binary of a home automation appliance in
the following scenarios:

a)  Door  lock  inclusion  into  the  Z-Wave  network  for  the
first  time:  encryption  key  exchange  takes  place  between  the
controller  appliance  and  the  door  lock  to  establish  a  shared
symmetric key.

b)  Sending  lock/unlock  commands  to  the  Z-Wave  door
lock:
the  established
is  encrypted  using
encryption key and authentication value is also appended to the
frame.

the  command

c)  Door  lock  inclusion  after  controller  appliance  factory
rest:  The  factory  reset  will  erase  previously  established  key
from  the  appliance  but  the  door  lock  will  still  hold  the  old
encryption key.

Analysis of scenario (a) indicated that the encryption key is
not  exchanged  in  clear  text.  This  key  is  generated  using  the
hardware based pseudo random number generator (PRNG) on

the Z-Wave chip and then is encrypted by using a hard coded
temporary default key in chip’s firmware before being sent to
the door lock. The value of this temporary key was found to be
16  bytes  of  zero.    Although  an  attacker  could  intercept  the
encrypted key exchange frame, and decipher it using the hard-
coded  key  this  attack  vector  was  not  interesting  to  us,  as  the
key exchange only  happens at system initial setup time or re-
installation that limits the attack time window. Furthermore Z-
Wave devices can switch their radio to low power transmission
mode during key exchange process to make packet interception
attack much more difficult.

After successful exchange of the network key ((cid:1)(cid:1)) between
the controller appliance and the door lock, they both derive two
new  128-bit  keys:  frame  encryption  key  ((cid:1)(cid:2))  and  data  origin
authentication  key  ((cid:1)(cid:3))  by  using  AES  encryption  in  ECB
mode as following:

 (cid:1)(cid:2) = (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)-(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:1)((cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:2))
(cid:1)(cid:3) = (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)-(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:1)((cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:3))

(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:2)  and  (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:3)  values  were  found  to  be  16-byte
values  hardcoded into  the  Z-Wave  firmware as  highlighted in
Appendix A.

Z-Wave  data  origin  authentication  is  based  on  the  cipher
block  chaining  message  authentication  code  (CBC-MAC)
technique  that  can  calculate  a  message  authentication  code
(MAC)  from  a  block  cipher  algorithm  such  as  AES.  The
generated  MAC  value  ensures  that  the  Z-Wave  frame  is  not
tampered  with  or  corrupted  during  the  transmission  (data
integrity) and that it has been sent by the node claiming to be
the message source (origin authentication). In order to prevent
packet replay attacks, 64-bit nonce values generated by the Z-
Wave  chip’s  PRNG  are  used  during  MAC  calculation  as
described by the following formula:

(cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:5) = (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)-(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:2)(IV,SH||SRC||DST||LEN||C)

Initialization  vector  (IV)  is  16  bytes  long  with  bytes  zero  to
seven set by the PRNG and bytes 7 to 15 set to the nonce value
received from the destination node. The security header (SH) is
a one byte value that determines the type of secure messages:
nonce  request  (0x40),  nonce  reply  (0x80)  and  encrypted  data
(0x81). SRC and DST are the source and destination node IDs,
LEN is the encrypted payload length in bytes and finally C is
the  encrypted  payload  bytes  that  are  generated  by  using  AES
algorithm in OFB mode:

(cid:5) = (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)-(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:3)(IV,P)

P  is  the  plain  text  variable  size  payload  that  contains  Z-
Wave command header, class, ID and parameters.

With  the  above  knowledge  of  Z-Wave  encryption  and
authentication,  we  developed  a  door  lock  key  exchange
module  for  the  Z-Force  tool  that  enabled  us  to  control  all
steps  of  the  key  exchange  protocol  (Figure  3),  run  it  with
our own network key and observe the responses from the
door lock.  After  running a  few  tests  including scenario (c)
that  was  mentioned  earlier  in  this  section,  we  identified  a
critical  protocol  implementation  vulnerability  that  could

allow an attacker to reset the established network key on a
target Z-Wave door lock to a known value of his choice and
then issue unauthorised commands.

Figure 4 – Key exchange protocol

The root cause of this issue was lack of state validation
in the key exchange protocol handler programmed in the Z-
Wave door lock firmware. This handler code is called when
the door lock receives the key exchange start packet which
payload  is  0x98  0x04  from  the  home  controller  device.  At
this  point,  the  handler  function  needs  to  load  a  shared
encryption  key  so  that  it  can  decrypt  the  rest  of  key
exchange packets received from the controller and be able
to encrypt its response packets. However before using  the
hardcoded  temporary  key  (16  bytes  of  zero)  for  this
purpose, the door lock should check the state of the current
shared  key  in  its  EEPROM  and  load  the  previously
provisioned network key if one already exists. On contrary,
we discovered that the Z-Wave door lock does not perform
this  important  state  validation.  As  a  result,  a  remote
attacker  who  has  detailed  knowledge  of  the  key  exchange
protocol and is in possession of a Z-Wave packet injection
tool  similar  to  Z-Force  can  force  the  target  Z-Wave  door
lock to overwrite its current shared network key with that
of  the  attacker.  This  would  enable  the  attacker  to  send
secure  Z-Wave  messages  to  perform  unauthorised  actions
such  as  unlocking  the  door  or  changing  users’  PIN  codes.
We successfully demonstrated this attack against a 128 bit
AES  encrypted  door  lock  using  Z-Force  kit  that  was

configured to operate in 868.42 MHz frequency and 40Kbps
data transfer rate.

I. IMPACT
Successful exploitation of the aforementioned vulnerability
can  enable  an  attacker  to  take  full  control  of  the  affected  Z-
Wave  door  locks  and  possibly  other  secure  devices  in  a
building. If the compromised door lock attempts to send “Door
is  Open”  event  to  the  controller  after  being  unlocked  by  the
attacker,  the  received  packet  will  contain  an  invalid  frame
authentication  field  and  will  be  discarded  by  the  controller
software.  Therefore,  the  home  residents  or  building  manager
will not be alerted about the intrusion.

II. CONCLUSION
We  have  analysed  Z-Wave  proprietary  protocol  and
uncovered the details of its encryption, authentication and key
exchange protocols. Based on this knowledge we developed a
low  cost  Z-Wave  packet  interception  and  injection  tool  that
enabled  us  to  perform  vulnerability  discovery  on  the  Z-Wave
door  locks.  Using  this  tool,  we  have  demonstrated  an
implementation  vulnerability
in  Z-Wave  key  exchange
protocol that could be exploited to take full control of a target
Z-Wave door lock by only knowing the Home and node IDs of
the target device, both of which can be identified by observing
the Z-Wave network traffic over a short period of time due to
the  frequent  polling  of  devices  in  a  Z-Wave  network,  for
example  to  get  status  or  battery  level  of  the  device.  This
vulnerability  was  not  due  to  a  flaw  in  the  Z-Wave  protocol
specification,  but  because  of  an  implementation  error  in
disabling  the  use  of  temporary  key  after  initial  network  key
exchange during inclusion of a node to the network.

We have communicated the details of this vulnerability to
the  vendor  who  has  conducted  a  security  review  of  Z-Wave
specification  and  SDK  to  ensure  that  they  cover  correct
handling  of  the  discovered  vulnerability.  Finally,  Sigma
Designs has taken action to prevent such implementation flaws

to reach the market in the future by adding additional security
test cases to the certification test suite.

We  also  recommend  Z-Wave  device  manufacturers  to
examine their firmware code for this vulnerability. Due to the
flexibility of Z-Force tool, it can also be used to identify other
vulnerabilities  for  example  memory  corruptions  in  closed
source Z-Wave firmware via fuzz testing.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

We  would  like  to  thank  Sigma  Designs  for  their  urgent

response and verification of the reported vulnerability.

# Z-Shave. Exploiting Z-Wave downgrade attacks

Andrew Tierney
23 May 2018

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2016/05/zshave.png)

**TL;DR: Stronger S2 Z-Wave pairing security process can be downgraded to weak S0, exposing smart devices to compromise.**

Z-Wave uses a shared network key to secure traffic. This key is exchanged between the controller and the client devices (‘nodes’) when the devices are paired. The keys are used to protect the communications and prevent attackers exploiting joined devices.

The earlier pairing process (‘S0’) had a vulnerability – the network key was transmitted between the nodes using a key of all zeroes, and could be sniffed by an attacker within RF range. This issue was [documented by Sensepost in 2013](https://sensepost.com/cms/resources/conferences/2013/bh_zwave/Security%20Evaluation%20of%20Z-Wave_WP.pdf). We have shown that the improved, more secure pairing process (‘S2’) can be downgraded back to S0, negating all improvements.

Once you’ve got the network key, you have access to control the Z-Wave devices on the network. 2,400 vendors and over 100 million Z-wave chips are out there in smart devices, from door locks to lighting to heating to home alarms. The range is usually better than Bluetooth too: over 100 metres.

There have been some interesting developments during [disclosure](#disclosure), which seem to have been triggered when the media became interested.

### The hack

As we couldn’t get hold of a controller supporting S2 security, we are using a Sigma provided tool called ‘PC Controller’. This is not a Z-Wave certified S2 controller, and hence does not display a warning when S0 security is used. Most S2 controllers have a very limited UI, so even if they do alert the user it’s likely to be no more than a flashing LED.

### Older, weak Z-Wave S0 security

S0 exchanges the network key by encrypting it with a fixed key of 0000000000000000. This means that an attacker in RF range when the device is paired can obtain the network key and attack any device on the network. This is a known issue.

### ‘Fixing’ this with S2

S2 aims to fix this problem. The key-exchange now uses Diffie-Hellman and can also involve authentication by entry of a 5 digit code into the controller. As a result, if S2 pairing is used, **it should not be possible to intercept the key**.

There are other differences between S0 and S2 but they are not relevant to this issue.

If S2 pairing is used, it is true that the key cannot be intercepted. However, protocol weaknesses around the selection of S0 and S2 mean that an active attacker, present at the time of pairing, can downgrade an S2 pairing to S0, thereby allowing them to intercept the key and then intercept and inject S0 traffic on the Z-Wave network.

### How-to:

Z-Wave Zniffer was used to observe both open (no encryption), S0 and S2 pairings, using a Z-Wave PC Controller using the Sigma UZB EU. S2 is not supported on any retail controllers currently available in the UK, so this was the only option available.

We used a Yale Conexis L1 smart lock with a Z-Wave module 2 installed, supporting S2:

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2016/05/zwlock.png)

It was noted that devices and controllers are backwards compatible. An S2 device will pair as S0 if the controller only support S0. An S0 device will pair with no encryption if the controller does not support S0. A network can support a mixture of devices, although encrypted traffic cannot move from S0 to S2 or vice versa.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2018/05/zw1.png)

Figure 1 – sniffing Z-Wave using Zniffer

The process of adding S0 devices is summarised below:

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2018/05/zw2.png)

The process of adding an S2 node is shown below. Note the key exchange, a major difference between S0 and S2:

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2018/05/zw3.png)

In both instances, the controller must be put into “add” mode by physical action. A button must then be pressed on the device. This causes the device to send out a “node info”, which the controller receives and proceeds with the pairing.

Notice the similarity between the first part of the S0 and S2 flows. Up until “Security Scheme Get” and “KEX get”, the type of packets sent are identical. This raises the question: what causes the controller to follow the S0 or S2 key exchange process?

There is a very limited amount of data in the payload prior to the deviation:

* Node Info – this communicates the capabilities of the node including the supported command classes.
* Assign ID – this only communicate the ID that the node should take on.
* Ack – this contains no payload.

The only differences are in the Node Info information:

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2018/05/zw4.png)

Figure 2 – Node Info for a S2 device

A device supporting S2 will support the command class of 0x9F – COMMAND\_CLASS\_SECURITY\_2.

The node info command is entirely unencrypted and unauthenticated. This leads to us being able to spoof it, removing the COMMAND\_CLASS\_SECURITY\_2 command class. The controller then assumes that the device does not support S2, and pairs using S0 security. The attacker can now intercept the key exchange, obtain the network key and then command the device.

It’s important to note that the Z-Wave specification says that an S2 controller must notify the user when S0 security is used. We feel this will be ignored or overlooked.

The spoofed node info must contain the same home ID as the unpaired node. This home ID is not constant for a device and is regenerated each time it is removed or reset. This means an attacker must first obtain the home ID for the node before they can send a spoofed packet. This is entirely possible.

Original packet:

FB 2E E0 F2 00 01 4B 15 FF 01 01 53 DC 01 40 03 5E 55 98 **9F** 59

Modified packet

FB 2E E0 F2 00 01 41 14 FF 01 01 53 DC 01 40 03 5E 55 98 CD

The class of 0x9F has been removed, and the length and checksum recalculated.

#### Three different attacks

There are three different means by which the attack could be achieved:

### Method 1

A user would normally enable “add” mode on the controller before pressing the button on the node. However, from time to time this sequence is reversed, due to user error or simply fiddling with the device. This means that the node info for the unpaired node can be sniffed by an attacker, modified, and then sent to the controller.

We successfully carried out method 1 against the Yale Conexis L1 lock, resulting in it pairing as S0 and the attacker being able to lock and unlock the device.

Figure 8 – S2 device paired as S0

### Method 2

Some devices send a node info as soon as the battery is inserted. This would allow the attacker to obtain the node-info as the user unboxes and powers up the device. The attack could then proceed, even if the user does not press the add buttons in the incorrect order.

### Method 3

The third method involves active jamming using an RFCat. An attacker can continuously listen for the node info from the genuine node. As soon as the home ID has been obtained, they can actively jam the rest of the packet, preventing the node info from being received.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2018/05/zw12.png)

This attack requires further work though, owing to the time-critical jamming. This is because the jamming needs to occur mid-way through the transmission of a packet and the current tools available are only capable of waiting until the end of a packet.

### Z-Wave standards, disclosure and misleading statements from vendors

We asked Yale if the Conexis L1 with Z-Wave Module 2 can use S2 with any hardware – there was no response 12 days from this.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2018/05/zw13.png)

### However, SmartThings does not support S2, confirmed by Samsung!

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2018/05/zw15.png)

### Did Z-Wave know about this already, but kept it quiet?

We were fascinated to see reference to a “S0 downgrade attack” in Z-Wave documentation, suggesting that it may be a known issue but has not been acknowledged or resolved

<http://zwavepublic.com/sites/default/files/command_class_specs_2017A/SDS11846-20%20Z-Wave%20Plus%20Role%20Type%20Specification.pdf>

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2018/05/zw16.png)

There does not appear to be anything stating the S2 node should issue a warning message to the user. When an S2 node pairs to a S0 controller, the user will not be made aware.

There are two security situations possible:

### User pairs an S2 device to an S2 hub and is downgraded to S0

Z-Wave say the user should be warned of this by the controller. This warning may be ignored.

The downgrade attack will leak the (single) S0 security key. This puts all S0 devices at risk, even if the user unpairs the S2 device.

### User pairs an S2 device to an S0 hub and uses S0 by default

The S0 hub is totally unaware of S2, so cannot warn that S0 is in use.

The devices do not warn the user that S0 is in use.

Therefore a user is unlikely to realise.

There are only 4 controllers that support S2 in Europe; we cannot find any for sale or supported in the UK:

The Z-Wave Alliance has published statements that ALL devices **certified** after 2 April 2017 MUST support S2. Approximately 180 devices have been certified since April 2017, yet only 48 of these support S2 security – only around one quarter:

### Disclosure

During disclosure, it was found that the Z-Wave specifications referred to a “S0 downgrade attack” – this was an issue already known by Silabs. We got a lukewarm response through responsible disclosure, and it was only after a journalist contacted Silabs for comment, Silabs made a blog post entitled [“tl;dr: Your Door is Still Locked”](https://www.silabs.com/community/blog.entry.html/2018/05/23/tl_dr_your_door_is-g1zC). This links to a previously unpublished report of a security test of the S2 protocol, performed over three days in June 2017, again by SensePost.

The report does find a downgrade issue with the S2 protocol, but there are some important differences to the attack we present.

In the SensePost report, the downgrade occurs when the user fails to enter the S2 “device specific key” quickly enough. The text in the report states that the downgrade is from S2 to S0, however the screenshots of the PC Controller and Zniffer indicate that no security is in use – not S0. We had noticed the same issue during our testing, but saw that the downgrade is from S2 to no security.

The PC Controller prefixes the node name with [S0] when a device is paired with S0, and nothing when no security is in use. More obviously, the Zniffer data doesn’t show the characteristic nonce get/report cycle involved during S0 communication.

A downgrade to no security may sound like it has more serious impact, but it means that the attacker cannot obtain the S0 network key. This means the only node placed at risk is the one just added. If an S0 network key is obtained, all S0 devices connected in the past and future are placed at risk.

The bigger difference is that our attack can be carried out by an active attacker within RF range at the time of pairing. And when we say active attacker – we don’t mean a guy in a hoody sat in a car with a laptop. A battery-powered drop-box could be left outside the property for weeks, waiting for a pairing event to occur.

Our bigger concern with the report is that the issue was dropped from “High” to “Info”:

We strongly disagree that a flaw introduced “by design” reduces the risk this much.

We have massive respect for SensePost. They found a variant of the issue that we later discovered; the problem is that Silabs did not make their customers aware.

### Conclusion

We don’t think this is a fault of Yale, we’re just using their lock as an example. Other than some slightly misleading marketing materials, their claims are accurate. The ‘Z-Shave’ issue appears to be a standards and implementation issue.

We aren’t certain how backward compatibility with S0 can be supported whilst enforcing stronger S2 security. This underlines the challenge with many protocols: how do you improve security without creating mountains of electronic waste for devices that are no longer supported?

At the very least, the user should be fully alerted to the fallback to weak security.

The risk is mitigated as one has to be present during the pairing process, but the Z-Wave RF range is significant. We’re investigating whether it might be possible to de-authenticate a Z-Wave client device, but that’s work in progress.

Finally, we’re not particularly happy that the Z-Wave Alliance appears to have been aware of the downgrade attack, but hasn’t really addressed it. The appearance in press releases that S2 was a requirement from April 2017 seems to us to be really quite misleading.
