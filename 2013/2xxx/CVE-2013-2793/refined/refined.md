{
  "CVE-2013-2793": {
    "Root cause": "Improper input validation in Triangle MicroWorks' software.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can send a specially crafted TCP packet to cause the software to enter an infinite loop, leading to a process crash. The affected system needs a manual restart to recover.",
    "Attack vectors": {
      "IP-based": "Remote exploitation via network by sending a specially crafted TCP packet.",
      "Serial-based": "Requires local physical access to the master station connected via a serial connection. The same attack can be accomplished by directly interacting with the serial port."
     },
    "Required attacker capabilities": {
      "IP-based": "Moderate skill level to craft the malicious TCP packet.",
      "Serial-based": "High skill level, requiring either physical access or some social engineering to access the serial port."
    },
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability affects multiple products and versions of Triangle MicroWorks, including SCADA Data Gateway, DNP3 .NET Protocol components, and DNP3 ANSI C source code libraries. The vulnerability was identified by Adam Crain of Automatak and independent researcher Chris Sistrunk."
