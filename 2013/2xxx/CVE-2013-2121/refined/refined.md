  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `create` method in the `BookmarksController` uses the `controller` attribute of a newly created bookmark in an `eval` statement without sanitizing it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Code Injection",
       "Improper Input Validation",
       "Use of eval() statement"
