                 CVE-2013-2849

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the chromium web browser.
Multiple use-after-free, out-of-bounds read, memory safety, and
cross-site scripting issues were discovered and corrected.

CVE-2013-2837

    Use-after-free vulnerability in the SVG implementation allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
    other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2838

    Google V8, as used in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93, allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)
    via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2013-2839

    Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 does not properly perform a cast
    of an unspecified variable during handling of clipboard data, which
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    have other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2840

    Use-after-free vulnerability in the media loader in Chromium
    before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
    vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-2846.

CVE-2013-2841

    Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of
    Pepper resources.

CVE-2013-2842

    Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of
    widgets.

CVE-2013-2843

    Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of
    speech data.

CVE-2013-2844

    Use-after-free vulnerability in the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
    implementation in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
    other impact via vectors related to style resolution.

CVE-2013-2845

    The Web Audio implementation in Google Chrome before 27.0.1453.93
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
    vectors.

CVE-2013-2846

    Use-after-free vulnerability in the media loader in Google Chrome
    before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
    vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-2840.

CVE-2013-2847

    Race condition in the workers implementation in Google Chrome before
    27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
    other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2848

    The XSS Auditor in Google Chrome before 27.0.1453.93 might allow
    remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified
    vectors.

CVE-2013-2849

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Google Chrome
    before 27.0.1453.93 allow user-assisted remote attackers to inject
    arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving a (1)
    drag-and-drop or (2) copy-and-paste operation.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), the security support window
for chromium has ended.  Users of chromium on oldstable are very highly
encouraged to upgrade to the current stable Debian release (wheezy).
Chromium security support for wheezy will last until the next stable
release (jessie), which is expected to happen sometime in 2015.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 27.0.1453.93-1~deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 27.0.1453.93-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your chromium-browser packages.
