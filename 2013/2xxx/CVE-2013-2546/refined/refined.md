Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2546:

**1. Verification:**

The content from Ubuntu, and OpenSUSE specifically mentions CVE-2013-2546 and describes it as a memory leak in the Linux kernel's crypto report API. The commit message from the GitHub content confirms this is related to fixing information leaks in the crypto user report API.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The structures used for the netlink based crypto algorithm report API are located on the stack. `snprintf()` does not null-terminate, potentially disclosing stack data. Also, the module name was copied without ensuring it does not copy past the end of the string if it is smaller than the buffer, and `crypto_report_one()` did not initialize all fields of struct crypto\_user\_alg which could lead to heap info leak.

*   **Weakness:**
    *   Improper Null Termination
    *   Insufficient field initialization
    *   Incorrectly sized copies

*   **Impact:** A local user with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability can exploit the API to examine portions of kernel stack and heap memory, potentially leading to information disclosure.

*   **Attack Vector:** A local attacker with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` can call the crypto report API and trigger the memory leak.

*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   Local access to the system.
    *   `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-2546 is an information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's crypto report API. Due to stack memory not being properly null-terminated when copied to user space, a local attacker possessing the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability could potentially read portions of the kernel's stack memory. There was also a heap info leak due to uninitialized fields, and the module name copy could read beyond the actual name.
