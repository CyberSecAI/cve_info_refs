## Binary packages built by this source

[dbus](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/dbus):
simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)

D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.

 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 terms of complexity.

 .

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus

 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be

 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using

 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but

 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.

 .

 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

 .

 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.

 .

 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no

 longer contained in this package.

[dbus-1-dbg](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/dbus-1-dbg):
simple interprocess messaging system (debug symbols)

D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.

 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 terms of complexity.

 .

 This package provides support for debugging programs that use the core

 D-Bus shared library.

 .

 See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general.

[dbus-1-doc](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/dbus-1-doc):
simple interprocess messaging system (documentation)

D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.

 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 terms of complexity.

 .

 This package contains the API documentation for D-Bus, as well as

 the protocol specification.

 .

 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.

[dbus-x11](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/dbus-x11):
simple interprocess messaging system (X11 deps)

D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.

 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 terms of complexity.

 .

 This package contains the dbus-launch utility which is necessary for

 packages using a D-Bus session bus.

 .

 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.

[libdbus-1-3](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libdbus-1-3):
simple interprocess messaging system (library)

D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.

 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 terms of complexity.

 .

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus

 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be

 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using

 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but

 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.

 .

 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

 .

 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

[libdbus-1-dev](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libdbus-1-dev):
simple interprocess messaging system (development headers)

D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.

 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 terms of complexity.

 .

 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.

Subject: CVE-2013-2168: dbus: DoS in system services caused by _dbus_printf_string_upper_bound

Alexandru Cornea discovered a vulnerability in libdbus caused by an
implementation bug in _dbus_printf_string_upper_bound(). This
vulnerability can be exploited by a local user to crash system services
that use libdbus, causing denial of service. It is platform-specific:
x86-64 Linux is known to be affected.

This vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2013-2168 and is fixed in D-Bus
stable releases 1.4.26 and 1.6.12, and development release 1.7.4.
Upgrading is recommended.

Distributors who backport security fixes should use this commit:
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/commit/?id=954d75b2b64e4799f360d2a6bf9cff6d9fee37e7>

On Unix platforms, this vulnerability was introduced in dbus versions
1.4.16 and 1.5.8 while fixing a portability bug, freedesktop.org #11668.
The 1.2.x branch is not vulnerable.

On Windows, a similar bug exists in all branches that have Windows
support. The D-Bus project does not support security-sensitive uses of
D-Bus on Windows.

    Simon

CVE-2013-2168: \_dbus\_printf\_string\_upper\_bound: copy the va\_list for each useUsing a va\_list more than once is non-portable: it happens to work
under the ABI of (for instance) x86 Linux, but not x86-64 Linux.
This led to \_dbus\_printf\_string\_upper\_bound() crashing if it should
have returned exactly 1024 bytes. Many system services can be induced
to process a caller-controlled string in ways that
end up using \_dbus\_printf\_string\_upper\_bound(), so this is a denial of
service.

openSUSE Security Update: dbus-1: update to 1.6.24
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:1239-1
Rating: moderate
References: #896453
Cross-References: CVE-2014-3635 CVE-2014-3636 CVE-2014-3637
CVE-2014-3638 CVE-2014-3639
Affected Products:
openSUSE 12.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The DBUS-1 service and libraries were updated to upstream release 1.6.24
fixing security issues and bugs.
Upstream changes since dbus 1.6.8
+ Security fixes
- Do not accept an extra fd in the padding of a cmsg message, which
could lead to a 4-byte heap buffer overrun. (CVE-2014-3635,
fdo#83622; Simon McVittie)
- Reduce default for maximum Unix file descriptors passed per message
from 1024 to 16, preventing a uid with the default maximum number of
connections from exhausting the system bus' file descriptors under
Linux's default rlimit. Distributors or system administrators with a
more restrictive fd limit may wish to reduce these limits further.
Additionally, on Linux this prevents a second denial of service in
which the dbus-daemon can be made to exceed the maximum number of
fds per sendmsg() and disconnect the process that would have
received them. (CVE-2014-3636, fdo#82820; Alban Crequy)
- Disconnect connections that still have a fd pending unmarshalling
after a new configurable limit, pending\_fd\_timeout (defaulting to
150 seconds), removing the possibility of creating an abusive
connection that cannot be disconnected by setting up a circular
reference to a connection's file descriptor. (CVE-2014-3637,
fdo#80559; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for maximum pending replies per connection from 8192
to 128, mitigating an algorithmic complexity denial-of-service
attack (CVE-2014-3638, fdo#81053; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for authentication timeout on the system bus from 30
seconds to 5 seconds, avoiding denial of service by using up all
unauthenticated connection slots; and when all unauthenticated
connection slots are used up, make new connection attempts block
instead of disconnecting them. (CVE-2014-3639, fdo#80919; Alban
Crequy)
- On Linux >= 2.6.37-rc4, if sendmsg() fails with ETOOMANYREFS,
silently drop the message. This prevents an attack in which a
malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a system service,
which is a local denial of service. (fdo#80163, CVE-2014-3532; Alban
Crequy)
- Track remaining Unix file descriptors correctly when more than one
message in quick succession contains fds. This prevents another
attack which a malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a
system service. (fdo#79694, fdo#80469, CVE-2014-3533; Alejandro
Martínez Suárez, Simon McVittie, Alban Crequy)
- Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered and fixed a
denial-of-service flaw in dbus-daemon, part of the reference
implementation of D-Bus. Additionally, in highly unusual
environments the same flaw could lead to a side channel between
processes that should not be able to communicate. (CVE-2014-3477,
fdo#78979)
- CVE-2013-2168: Fix misuse of va\_list that could be used as a denial
of service for system services. Vulnerability reported by Alexandru
Cornea. (Simon)
+ Other fixes
- Don't leak memory on out-of-memory while listing activatable or
active services (fdo#71526, Radoslaw Pajak)
- fix undefined behaviour in a regression test (fdo#69924, DreamNik)
- path\_namespace='/' in match rules incorrectly matched nothing; it
now matches everything. (fdo#70799, Simon McVittie)
- Make dbus\_connection\_set\_route\_peer\_messages(x, FALSE) behave as
documented. Previously, it assumed its second parameter was TRUE.
(fdo#69165, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a NULL pointer dereference on an unlikely error path (fdo#69327,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- If accept4() fails with EINVAL, as it can on older Linux kernels
with newer glibc, try accept() instead of going into a busy-loop.
(fdo#69026, Chengwei Yang)
- If socket() or socketpair() fails with EINVAL or EPROTOTYPE, for
instance on Hurd or older Linux with a new glibc, try without
SOCK\_CLOEXEC. (fdo#69073; Pino Toscano, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a file descriptor leak on an error code path. (fdo#69182,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- Fix compilation if writev() is unavailable (fdo#69409, Vasiliy
Balyasnyy)
- Avoid an infinite busy-loop if a signal interrupts waitpid()
(fdo#68945, Simon McVittie)
- Escape addresses containing non-ASCII characters correctly
(fdo#53499, Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in \_dbus\_string\_init() or similar, don't
free an invalid pointer if the string is later freed (fdo#65959,
Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in dbus\_set\_error(), don't va\_end() a
va\_list that was never va\_start()ed (fdo#66300, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a regression test on platforms with strict alignment (fdo#67279,
Colin Walters)
- Avoid calling function parameters "interface" since certain Windows
headers have a namespace-polluting macro of that name (fdo#66493,
Ivan Romanov)
- Make "make -j check" work (fdo#68852, Simon McVittie)
- In dbus-daemon, don't crash if a .service file starts with key=value
(fdo#60853, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix an assertion failure if we try to activate systemd services
before systemd connects to the bus (fdo#50199, Chengwei Yang)
- Avoid compiler warnings for ignoring the return from write()
(Chengwei Yang)
- Following Unicode Corrigendum #9, the noncharacters U+nFFFE,
U+nFFFF, U+FDD0..U+FDEF are allowed in UTF-8 strings again.
(fdo#63072, Simon McVittie)
- Diagnose incorrect use of dbus\_connection\_get\_data() with negative
slot (i.e. before allocating the slot) rather than returning junk
(fdo#63127, Dan Williams)
- In the activation helper, when compiled for tests, do not reset the
system bus address, fixing the regression tests. (fdo#52202, Simon)
- Fix building with Valgrind 3.8, at the cost of causing harmless
warnings with Valgrind 3.6 on some compilers (fdo#55932, Arun
Raghavan)
- Don't leak temporary fds pointing to /dev/null (fdo#56927, Michel
HERMIER)
- Create session.d, system.d directories under CMake (fdo#41319, Ralf
Habacker)
- Include alloca.h for alloca() if available, fixing compilation on
Solaris 10 (fdo#63071, Dagobert Michelsen)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : dbus
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2168

Alexandru Cornea discovered a vulnerability in libdbus caused by an
implementation bug in _dbus_printf_string_upper_bound(). This
vulnerability can be exploited by a local user to crash system services
that use libdbus, causing denial of service. Depending on the dbus
services running, it could lead to complete system crash.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.12-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.12-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
