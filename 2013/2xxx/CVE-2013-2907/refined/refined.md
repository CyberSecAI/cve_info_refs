Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2907:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read within the `window.prototype` object in the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:**  The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the browser accesses memory associated with the `window.prototype` object, leading to a read beyond the allocated memory boundary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An out-of-bounds read can potentially expose sensitive information from the browser's memory. This information could include data from other web pages, cookies, or internal browser data, depending on memory layout.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While an out-of-bounds read is primarily an information disclosure vulnerability, it could be combined with other vulnerabilities to gain further control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the browser processes malicious web content that manipulates the `window.prototype` object.
*   This suggests a remote attack vector through visiting a specially crafted web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** An attacker needs to be able to convince a user to visit a malicious web page or deliver malicious web content via other means.
*   **Web Development Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate the `window.prototype` object and how to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Boris Zbarsky.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Chromium version 30.0.1599.66.
*   The vulnerability has been categorized as "Medium" severity by Google.
