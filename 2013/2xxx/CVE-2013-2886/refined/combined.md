Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2013/07/stable-channel-update_30.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, July 30, 2013

The Stable channel has been updated to 28.0.1500.95 for Chrome Frame, Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. This commonly occurs if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [11 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=Type%3DBug-Security+M%3D28+Release%3D1+-Security_Severity%3DNone+-OS%3DChrome%2C-OS%3DAndroid&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Iteration+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight some fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or particularly interesting. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

In addition, our ongoing internal security work was as usual responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[261701](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=261701)] High CVE-2013-2886: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Full details about what changes are in this build are available in the [SVN revision log](http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/branches/1500/src&range=209102:213514&mode=html).
