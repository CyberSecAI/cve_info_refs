Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-2005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of return values from the `XGetWindowProperty()` function within the `libXt` library. Specifically, several functions within `Selection.c` incorrectly assumed that `XGetWindowProperty()` would always successfully initialize the pointer to the window property. In reality, prior to libX11 version 1.6, `XGetWindowProperty()` could fail to do so, leaving the pointer uninitialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability arises from the following:
*   **Unchecked Return Values:** `libXt` did not check the return status of `XGetWindowProperty()` and blindly proceeded to use the returned pointer without validating if it was actually initialized.
*   **Use of Uninitialized Pointers:** When `XGetWindowProperty()` failed and did not initialize the pointer, subsequent operations like dereferencing, freeing, or passing to other functions resulted in operating on an uninitialized pointer, causing memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
*   **Memory Corruption:** Due to using uninitialized pointers, the application can write to arbitrary memory locations.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption could cause the application to crash.
*   **Potentially Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some scenarios, memory corruption could be leveraged to overwrite function pointers or other critical data leading to arbitrary code execution (although this is not explicitly stated in the provided context, memory corruption can often lead to this).

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by:
*   **Malicious X Server:** A malicious or compromised X server could send responses to a client that would cause `XGetWindowProperty()` to fail.
*   **Manipulated Data:** An attacker can control the X server response (especially in setups with virtual X servers) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to be able to:
*   **Control an X Server:** The attacker needs to be able to either control or manipulate an X server to send responses that would cause `XGetWindowProperty()` to fail within a vulnerable `libXt` client.
*   **Have a setuid Client:**  In scenarios with setuid X clients (such as screen lock programs), an attacker can connect the privileged client to a modified virtual X server. This allows for privilege escalation.

**Affected Functions in libXt:**
*   `ReqCleanup()`
*   `HandleSelectionEvents()`
*   `ReqTimedOut()`
*   `HandleNormal()`
*   `HandleSelectionReplies()`

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability existed because of a flaw in `libX11` (versions prior to 1.6) which didn't guarantee the initialization of returned pointers from `XGetWindowProperty()` on failure. `libX11` was later patched to initialize the pointer to NULL on failure, but `libXt` also needed to check the return status to prevent the issue in older versions.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ilja Van Sprundel of IOActive.
*   The fix for this issue involves ensuring that the pointers are properly initialized within libXt and verifying that XGetWindowProperty does not return a failure.
