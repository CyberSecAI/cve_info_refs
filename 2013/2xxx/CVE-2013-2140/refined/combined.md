## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows specified to be run as root. A local could exploit this flaw to run

commands as root when using the perf tool. user could exploit this

([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to

connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](/security/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key\_socket implementation

in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine

potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](/security/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux

kernel when the IPV6\_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in

combination with the UDP\_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](/security/CVE-2013-4163))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-30-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.8.0-30.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.8.0-30.44)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

The dispatch\_discard\_io function in drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c in
the Xen blkback implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.10.5 allows
guest OS users to cause a denial of service (data loss) via filesystem
write operations on a read-only disk that supports the (1) BLKIF\_OP\_DISCARD
(aka discard or TRIM) or (2) SCSI UNMAP feature.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it
provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a
guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to
destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to
write to the disk.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service by creating a

large number of files with names that have the same CRC32 hash value.

([CVE-2012-5374](/security/CVE-2012-5374))

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file

creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash

value in a directory important to the victim. ([CVE-2012-5375](/security/CVE-2012-5375))

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to

run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to

connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](/security/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key\_socket implementation

in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine

potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](/security/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux

kernel when the IPV6\_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in

combination with the UDP\_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](/security/CVE-2013-4163))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-232-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-232.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-232.48)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

x86: Fix /proc/mtrr with base/size more than 44bits
commit d5c78673b1b28467354c2c30c3d4f003666ff385 upstream.
On one sytem that mtrr range is more then 44bits, in dmesg we have
[ 0.000000] MTRR default type: write-back
[ 0.000000] MTRR fixed ranges enabled:

[ 0.000000] 8 disabled
[ 0.000000] 9 disabled
but /proc/mtrr report wrong:
reg00: base=0x080000000 ( 2048MB), size= 2048MB, count=1: uncachable
reg01: base=0x80000000000 (8388608MB), size=1048576MB, count=1: uncachable
reg02: base=0x099000000 ( 2448MB), size= 16MB, count=1: write-through
reg03: base=0x09a000000 ( 2464MB), size= 16MB, count=1: write-through
reg04: base=0x81ffa000000 (8519584MB), size= 32MB, count=1: write-through
reg05: base=0x81ffc000000 (8519616MB), size= 1MB, count=1: write-through
reg06: base=0x0ad000000 ( 2768MB), size= 16MB, count=1: write-through
reg07: base=0x0bd000000 ( 3024MB), size= 16MB, count=1: write-through
reg08: base=0x09b000000 ( 2480MB), size= 16MB, count=1: write-combining
so bit 44 and bit 45 get cut off.
We have problems in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/generic.c::generic\_get\_mtrr().
1. for base, we miss cast base\_lo to 64bit before shifting.
Fix that by adding u64 casting.
2. for size, it only can handle 44 bits aka 32bits + page\_shift
Fix that with 64bit mask instead of 32bit mask\_lo, then range could be
more than 44bits.
At the same time, we need to update size\_or\_mask for old cpus that does
support cpuid 0x80000008 to get phys\_addr. Need to set high 32bits
to all 1s, otherwise will not get correct size for them.
Also fix mtrr\_add\_page: it should check base and (base + size - 1)
instead of base and size, as base and size could be small but
base + size could bigger enough to be out of boundary. We can
use boot\_cpu\_data.x86\_phys\_bits directly to avoid size\_or\_mask.
So When are we going to have size more than 44bits? that is 16TiB.
after patch we have right ouput:
reg00: base=0x080000000 ( 2048MB), size= 2048MB, count=1: uncachable
reg01: base=0x380000000000 (58720256MB), size=1048576MB, count=1: uncachable
reg02: base=0x099000000 ( 2448MB), size= 16MB, count=1: write-through
reg03: base=0x09a000000 ( 2464MB), size= 16MB, count=1: write-through
reg04: base=0x381ffa000000 (58851232MB), size= 32MB, count=1: write-through
reg05: base=0x381ffc000000 (58851264MB), size= 1MB, count=1: write-through
reg06: base=0x0ad000000 ( 2768MB), size= 16MB, count=1: write-through
reg07: base=0x0bd000000 ( 3024MB), size= 16MB, count=1: write-through
reg08: base=0x09b000000 ( 2480MB), size= 16MB, count=1: write-combining
-v2: simply checking in mtrr\_add\_page according to hpa.
[ hpa: This probably wants to go into -stable only after having sat in
mainline for a bit. It is not a regression. ]

commit 2652eb4444fc2965a428a07123b877be1637711a

perf tools: Revert regression in configuration of Python support
commit a363a9da65d253fa7354ce5fd630f4f94df934cc upstream.
Among other things, the following:
commit 31160d7feab786c991780d7f0ce2755a469e0e5e
Date: Tue Jan 8 16:22:36 2013 -0500
perf tools: Fix GNU make v3.80 compatibility issue
attempts to aid the user by tapping into an existing error message,
as described in the commit message:
... Also fix an issue where \_get\_attempt was called with only
one argument. This prevented the error message from printing
the name of the variable that can be used to fix the problem.
or more precisely:
-$(if $($(1)),$(call \_ge\_attempt,$($(1)),$(1)),$(call \_ge\_attempt,$(2)))
+$(if $($(1)),$(call \_ge\_attempt,$($(1)),$(1)),$(call \_ge\_attempt,$(2),$(1)))
However, The "missing" argument was in fact missing on purpose; it's
absence is a signal that the error message should be skipped, because
the failure would be due to the default value, not any user-supplied
value. This can be seen in how `\_ge\_attempt' uses `gea\_err' (in the
config/utilities.mak file):
\_ge\_attempt = $(if $(get-executable),$(get-executable),$(\_gea\_warn)$(call \_gea\_err,$(2)))
\_gea\_warn = $(warning The path '$(1)' is not executable.)
\_gea\_err = $(if $(1),$(error Please set '$(1)' appropriately))
That is, because the argument is no longer missing, the value `$(1)'
(associated with `\_gea\_err') always evaluates to true, thus always
triggering the error condition that is meant to be reserved for
only the case when a user explicitly supplies an invalid value.
Concretely, the result is a regression in the Makefile's configuration
of python support; rather than gracefully disable support when the
relevant executables cannot be found according to default values, the
build process halts in error as though the user explicitly supplied
the values.
This new commit simply reverts the offending one-line change.

iscsi-target: Fix iscsit\_sequence\_cmd reject handling for iser
commit 561bf15892375597ee59d473a704a3e634c4f311 upstream
This patch moves ISCSI\_OP\_REJECT failures into iscsit\_sequence\_cmd()
in order to avoid external iscsit\_reject\_cmd() reject usage for all
PDU types.
It also updates PDU specific handlers for traditional iscsi-target
code to not reset the session after posting a ISCSI\_OP\_REJECT during
setup.

iscsi-target: Fix iscsit\_add\_reject\* usage for iser
commit ba159914086f06532079fc15141f46ffe7e04a41 upstream
This patch changes iscsit\_add\_reject() + iscsit\_add\_reject\_from\_cmd()
usage to not sleep on iscsi\_cmd->reject\_comp to address a free-after-use
usage bug in v3.10 with iser-target code.
It saves ->reject\_reason for use within iscsit\_build\_reject() so the
correct value for both transport cases. It also drops the legacy
fail\_conn parameter usage throughput iscsi-target code and adds
two iscsit\_add\_reject\_cmd() and iscsit\_reject\_cmd helper functions,
along with various small cleanups.
(v2: Re-enable target\_put\_sess\_cmd() to be called from
iscsit\_add\_reject\_from\_cmd() for rejects invoked after
target\_get\_sess\_cmd() has been called)

radeon kms: do not flush uninitialized hotplug work
commit a01c34f72e7cd2624570818f579b5ab464f93de2 upstream.
Fix a warning from lockdep caused by calling flush\_work() for
uninitialized hotplug work. Initialize hotplug\_work, audio\_work
and reset\_work upon successful radeon\_irq\_kms\_init() completion
and thus perform hotplug flush\_work only when rdev->irq.installed
is true.

xen/evtchn: avoid a deadlock when unbinding an event channel
commit 179fbd5a45f0d4034cc6fd37b8d367a3b79663c4 upstream.
Unbinding an event channel (either with the ioctl or when the evtchn
device is closed) may deadlock because disable\_irq() is called with
port\_user\_lock held which is also locked by the interrupt handler.
Think of the IOCTL\_EVTCHN\_UNBIND is being serviced, the routine has
just taken the lock, and an interrupt happens. The evtchn\_interrupt
is invoked, tries to take the lock and spins forever.
A quick glance at the code shows that the spinlock is a local IRQ
variant. Unfortunately that does not help as "disable\_irq() waits for
the interrupt handler on all CPUs to stop running. If the irq occurs
on another VCPU, it tries to take port\_user\_lock and can't because
the unbind ioctl is holding it." (from David). Hence we cannot
depend on the said spinlock to protect us. We could make it a system
wide IRQ disable spinlock but there is a better way.
We can piggyback on the fact that the existence of the spinlock is
to make get\_port\_user() checks be up-to-date. And we can alter those
checks to not depend on the spin lock (as it's protected by u->bind\_mutex
in the ioctl) and can remove the unnecessary locking (this is
IOCTL\_EVTCHN\_UNBIND) path.
In the interrupt handler we cannot use the mutex, but we do not
need it.
"The unbind disables the irq before making the port user stale, so when
you clear it you are guaranteed that the interrupt handler that might
use that port cannot be running." (from David).
Hence this patch removes the spinlock usage on the teardown path
and piggybacks on disable\_irq happening before we muck with the
get\_port\_user() data. This ensures that the interrupt handler will
never run on stale data.

livelock avoidance in sget()
commit acfec9a5a892f98461f52ed5770de99a3e571ae2 upstream.
Eric Sandeen has found a nasty livelock in sget() - take a mount(2) about
to fail. The superblock is on ->fs\_supers, ->s\_umount is held exclusive,
->s\_active is 1. Along comes two more processes, trying to mount the same
thing; sget() in each is picking that superblock, bumping ->s\_count and
trying to grab ->s\_umount. ->s\_active is 3 now. Original mount(2)
finally gets to deactivate\_locked\_super() on failure; ->s\_active is 2,
superblock is still ->fs\_supers because shutdown will \*not\* happen until
->s\_active hits 0. ->s\_umount is dropped and now we have two processes
chasing each other:
s\_active = 2, A acquired ->s\_umount, B blocked
A sees that the damn thing is stillborn, does deactivate\_locked\_super()
s\_active = 1, A drops ->s\_umount, B gets it
A restarts the search and finds the same superblock. And bumps it ->s\_active.
s\_active = 2, B holds ->s\_umount, A blocked on trying to get it
... and we are in the earlier situation with A and B switched places.
The root cause, of course, is that ->s\_active should not grow until we'd
got MS\_BORN. Then failing ->mount() will have deactivate\_locked\_super()
shut the damn thing down. Fortunately, it's easy to do - the key point
is that grab\_super() is called only for superblocks currently on ->fs\_supers,
so it can bump ->s\_count and grab ->s\_umount first, then check MS\_BORN and
bump ->s\_active; we must never increment ->s\_count for superblocks past
->kill\_sb(), but grab\_super() is never called for those.
The bug is pretty old; we would've caught it by now, if not for accidental
exclusion between sget() for block filesystems; the things like cgroup or
e.g. mtd-based filesystems don't have anything of that sort, so they get
bitten. The right way to deal with that is obviously to fix sget()...

tty\_port: Fix refcounting leak in tty\_port\_tty\_hangup()
commit 1d9e689c934bd5ecb0f273c6c65e0655c5cfee5f upstream.
The function tty\_port\_tty\_hangup() could leak a reference to the tty\_struct:
struct tty\_struct \*tty = tty\_port\_tty\_get(port);
if (tty && (!check\_clocal || !C\_CLOCAL(tty))) {
tty\_hangup(tty);
tty\_kref\_put(tty);
}
If tty != NULL and the second condition is false we never call tty\_kref\_put and
the reference is leaked.
Fix by always calling tty\_kref\_put() which accepts a NULL argument.
The patch fixes a regression introduced by commit aa27a094.

mm: mempolicy: fix mbind\_range() && vma\_adjust() interaction
commit 3964acd0dbec123aa0a621973a2a0580034b4788 upstream.
vma\_adjust() does vma\_set\_policy(vma, vma\_policy(next)) and this
is doubly wrong:
1. This leaks vma->vm\_policy if it is not NULL and not equal to
next->vm\_policy.
This can happen if vma\_merge() expands "area", not prev (case 8).
2. This sets the wrong policy if vma\_merge() joins prev and area,
area is the vma the caller needs to update and it still has the
old policy.
Revert commit 1444f92c8498 ("mm: merging memory blocks resets
mempolicy") which introduced these problems.
Change mbind\_range() to recheck mpol\_equal() after vma\_merge() to fix
the problem that commit tried to address.

While at it also block out the rps disable introduced by the above

drm/i915: Serialize almost all register access
commit a7cd1b8fea2f341b626b255d9898a5ca5fabbf0a upstream.
In theory, the different register blocks were meant to be only ever
touched when holding either the struct\_mutex, mode\_config.lock or even a
specific localised lock. This does not seem to be the case, and the
hardware reacts extremely badly if we attempt to concurrently access two
registers within the same cacheline.
The HSD suggests that we only need to do this workaround for display
range registers. However, upon review we need to serialize the multiple
stages in our register write functions - if only for preemption
protection.
Irrespective of the hardware requirements, the current io functions are
a little too loose with respect to the combination of pre- and
post-condition testing that we do in conjunction with the actual io. As
a result, we may be pre-empted and generate both false-postive and
false-negative errors.
Note well that this is a "90%" solution, there remains a few direct
users of ioread/iowrite which will be fixed up in the next few patches.
Since they are more invasive and that this simple change will prevent
almost all lockups on Haswell, we kept this patch simple to facilitate
backporting to stable.

drm/i915: Restore fences after resume and GPU resets
The result was that we've restored fences for objects with no tiling,
since the object<->fence link still existed after resume. Now that
wouldn't have been too bad since any subsequent access would have
fixed things up, but if we've changed from tiled to untiled real havoc
happened:
The tiling stride is stored -1 in the fence register, so a stride of 0
resulted in all 1s in the top 32bits, and so a completely bogus fence
spanning everything from the start of the object to the top of the
GTT. The tell-tale in the register dumps looks like:
FENCE START 2: 0x0214d001
FENCE END 2: 0xfffff3ff
Bit 11 isn't set since the hw doesn't store it, even when writing all
1s (at least on my snb here).
To prevent such a gaffle in the future add a sanity check for fences
with an untiled object attached in i915\_gem\_write\_fence.
v2: Fix the WARN, spotted by Chris.
v3: Trying to reuse get\_fences looked ugly and obfuscated the code.
Instead reuse update\_fence and to make it really dtrt also move the
fence dirty state clearing into update\_fence.

drm/i915: load boot context at driver init time
For some reason RC6 is already enabled at the beginning of resuming process.
Following initliaztion breaks some internal state and confuses RPS engine.
This patch disables RC6 at the beginnig of resume and initialization.
I've rearranged initialization sequence, because intel\_disable\_gt\_powersave()
needs initialized force\_wake\_get/put and some locks from the dev\_priv.
Note: The culprit in the initialization sequence seems to be the write
to MBCTL added in the above mentioned commit. The first version of
this patch just held a forcewake reference across the clock gating
init functions, which seems to have been enought to gather quite a few
positive test reports. But since that smelled a bit like ad-hoc
duct-tape v2 now just disables rps/rc6 across the entire hw setup.

drm/i915: Workaround incoherence between fences and LLC across multiple CPUs
Thanks to further investigation by Jon Bloomfield, he realised that
the 64-bit register might be broken up by the hardware into two 32-bit
writes (a problem we have encountered elsewhere). This non-atomicity
would then cause an issue where a second thread would see an
intermediate register state (new high dword, old low dword), and this
register would randomly be used in preference to its own thread register.
This would cause the second thread to read from and write into a fairly
random tiled location. Breaking the operation into 3 explicit 32-bit
updates (first disable the fence, poke the upper bits, then poke the lower
bits and enable) ensures that, given proper serialisation between the
32-bit register write and the memory transfer, that the fence value is
always consistent.
Armed with this knowledge, we can explain how the previous workaround
work. The key to the corruption is that a second thread sees an
erroneous fence register that conflicts and overrides its own. By
serialising the fence update across all CPUs, we have a small window
where no GTT access is occurring and so hide the potential corruption.
This also leads to the conclusion that the earlier workaround was
incomplete.
v2: Be overly paranoid about the order in which fence updates become
visible to the GPU to make really sure that we turn the fence off before
doing the update, and then only switch the fence on afterwards.

Partially revert "drm/i915: unconditionally use mt forcewake on hsw/ivb"
commit c11e5f35ab490bd30591563816fbc83526521777 upstream.
This patch partially reverts commit 36ec8f877481449bdfa072e6adf2060869e2b970 for
IvyBridge CPUs.
The original commit results in repeated 'Timed out waiting for forcewake old
ack to clear' messages on a Supermicro C7H61 board (BIOS version 2.00 and 2.00b)
with i7-3770K CPU. It ultimately results in a hangup if the system is highly
loaded. Reverting the commit for IvyBridge CPUs fixes the issue.
Issue a warning if the CPU is IvyBridge and mt forcewake is disabled, since
this condition can result in secondary issues.
v2: Only revert patch for Ivybridge CPUs

drm/i915: Fix write-read race with multiple rings
commit 02978ff57a5bdfbf703d2bc5a4d933a53ede3144 upstream.
Daniel noticed a problem where is we wrote to an object with ring A in
the middle of a very long running batch, then executed a quick batch on
ring B before a batch that reads from the same object, its obj->ring would
now point to ring B, but its last\_write\_seqno would be still relative to
ring A. This would allow for the user to read from the object before the
GPU had completed the write, as set\_domain would only check that ring B
had passed the last\_write\_seqno.
To fix this simply (and inelegantly), we bump the last\_write\_seqno when
switching rings so that the last\_write\_seqno is always relative to the
current obj->ring.
This fixes igt/tests/gem\_write\_read\_ring\_switch.

drm/radeon: fix combios tables on older cards
commit cef1d00cd56f600121ad121875655ad410a001b8 upstream.
Noticed that my old Radeon 7500 hung after printing
drm: GPU not posted. posting now...
when it wasn't selected as the primary card the BIOS. Some digging
revealed that it was hanging in combios\_parse\_mmio\_table() while
parsing the ASIC INIT 3 table. Looking at the BIOS ROM for the card,
it becomes obvious that there is no ASIC INIT 3 table in the BIOS.
The code is just processing random garbage. No surprise it hangs!
Why do I say that there is no ASIC INIT 3 table is the BIOS? This
table is found through the MISC INFO table. The MISC INFO table can
be found at offset 0x5e in the COMBIOS header. But the header is
smaller than that. The COMBIOS header starts at offset 0x126. The
standard PCI Data Structure (the bit that starts with 'PCIR') lives at
offset 0x180. That means that the COMBIOS header can not be larger
than 0x5a bytes and therefore cannot contain a MISC INFO table.
I looked at a dozen or so BIOS images, some my own, some downloaded from:
It is fairly obvious that the size of the COMBIOS header can be found
at offset 0x6 of the header. Not sure if it is a 16-bit number or
just an 8-bit number, but that doesn't really matter since the tables
seems to be always smaller than 256 bytes.
So I think combios\_get\_table\_offset() should check if the requested
table is present. This can be done by checking the offset against the
size of the header. See the diff below. The diff is against the WIP
OpenBSD codebase that roughly corresponds to Linux 3.8.13 at this
point. But I don't think this bit of the code changed much since
then.

drm/radeon: Another card with wrong primary dac adj
commit f7929f34fa0e0bb6736a2484fdc07d77a1653081 upstream.
Hello,
got another card with "too bright" problem:
Sapphire Radeon VE 7000 DDR (VGA+S-Video)
lspci -vnn:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI RV100 QY [Radeon 7000/VE] [1002:5159] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
Subsystem: PC Partner Limited Sapphire Radeon VE 7000 DDR [174b:7c28]
The patch below fixes the problem for this card.
But I don't like the blacklist, couldn't some heuristic be used instead?
The interesting thing is that the manufacturer is the same as the other card
needing the same quirk. I wonder how many different types are broken this way.
The "wrong" ps2\_pdac\_adj value that comes from BIOS on this card is 0x300.
====================

dm verity: fix inability to use a few specific devices sizes
commit b1bf2de07271932326af847a3c6a01fdfd29d4be upstream.
Fix a boundary condition that caused failure for certain device sizes.
The problem is reported at
http://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/issues/detail?id=160
For certain device sizes the number of hashes at a specific level was
calculated incorrectly.
It happens for example for a device with data and metadata block size 4096
that has 16385 blocks and algorithm sha256.
The user can test if he is affected by this bug by running the
"veritysetup verify" command and also by activating the dm-verity kernel
driver and reading the whole block device. If it passes without an error,
then the user is not affected.
The condition for the bug is:
Split the total number of data blocks (data\_block\_bits) into bit strings,
each string has hash\_per\_block\_bits bits. hash\_per\_block\_bits is
rounddown(log2(metadata\_block\_size/hash\_digest\_size)). Equivalently, you
can say that you convert data\_blocks\_bits to 2^hash\_per\_block\_bits base.
If there some zero bit string below the most significant bit string and at
least one bit below this zero bit string is set, then the bug happens.
The same bug exists in the userspace veritysetup tool, so you must use
fixed veritysetup too if you want to use devices that are affected by
this boundary condition.

dm mpath: fix ioctl deadlock when no paths
commit 6c182cd88d179cbbd06f4f8a8a19b6977940753f upstream.
When multipath needs to retry an ioctl the reference to the
current live table needs to be dropped. Otherwise a deadlock
occurs when all paths are down:
- dm\_blk\_ioctl takes a reference to the current table
and spins in multipath\_ioctl().
- A new table is being loaded, but upon resume the process
hangs in dm\_table\_destroy() waiting for references to
drop to zero.
With this patch the reference to the old table is dropped
prior to retry, thereby avoiding the deadlock.

nfsd: nfsd\_open: when dentry\_open returns an error do not propagate as struct file
commit e4daf1ffbe6cc3b12aab4d604e627829e93e9914 upstream.
The following call chain:
------------------------------------------------------------
nfs4\_get\_vfs\_file
- nfsd\_open
- dentry\_open
- do\_dentry\_open
- \_\_get\_file\_write\_access
- get\_write\_access
- return atomic\_inc\_unless\_negative(&inode->i\_writecount) ? 0 : -ETXTBSY;
------------------------------------------------------------
can result in the following state:
------------------------------------------------------------
struct nfs4\_file {
...
fi\_fds = {0xffff880c1fa65c80, 0xffffffffffffffe6, 0x0},
fi\_access = {{
counter = 0x1
}, {
counter = 0x0
}},
...
------------------------------------------------------------
1) First time around, in nfs4\_get\_vfs\_file() fp->fi\_fds[O\_WRONLY] is
NULL, hence nfsd\_open() is called where we get status set to an error
and fp->fi\_fds[O\_WRONLY] to -ETXTBSY. Thus we do not reach
nfs4\_file\_get\_access() and fi\_access[O\_WRONLY] is not incremented.
2) Second time around, in nfs4\_get\_vfs\_file() fp->fi\_fds[O\_WRONLY] is
NOT NULL (-ETXTBSY), so nfsd\_open() is NOT called, but
nfs4\_file\_get\_access() IS called and fi\_access[O\_WRONLY] is incremented.
Thus we leave a landmine in the form of the nfs4\_file data structure in
an incorrect state.
3) Eventually, when \_\_nfs4\_file\_put\_access() is called it finds
fi\_access[O\_WRONLY] being non-zero, it decrements it and calls
nfs4\_file\_put\_fd() which tries to fput -ETXTBSY.

powerpc/modules: Module CRC relocation fix causes perf issues
commit 0e0ed6406e61434d3f38fb58aa8464ec4722b77e upstream.
Module CRCs are implemented as absolute symbols that get resolved by
a linker script. We build an intermediate .o that contains an
unresolved symbol for each CRC. genksysms parses this .o, calculates
the CRCs and writes a linker script that "resolves" the symbols to
the calculated CRC.
Unfortunately the ppc64 relocatable kernel sees these CRCs as symbols
that need relocating and relocates them at boot. Commit d4703aef
(module: handle ppc64 relocating kcrctabs when CONFIG\_RELOCATABLE=y)
added a hook to reverse the bogus relocations. Part of this patch
created a symbol at 0x0:
# head -2 /proc/kallsyms
0000000000000000 T reloc\_start
c000000000000000 T .\_\_start
This reloc\_start symbol is causing lots of confusion to perf. It
thinks reloc\_start is a massive function that stretches from 0x0 to
0xc000000000000000 and we get various cryptic errors out of perf,
including:
problem incrementing symbol count, skipping event
This patch removes the reloc\_start linker script label and instead
defines it as PHYSICAL\_START. We also need to wrap it with
CONFIG\_PPC64 because the ppc32 kernel can set a non zero
PHYSICAL\_START at compile time and we wouldn't want to subtract
it from the CRCs in that case.

md/raid5: fix interaction of 'replace' and 'recovery'.
commit f94c0b6658c7edea8bc19d13be321e3860a3fa54 upstream.
If a device in a RAID4/5/6 is being replaced while another is being
recovered, then the writes to the replacement device currently don't
happen, resulting in corruption when the replacement completes and the
new drive takes over.
This is because the replacement writes are only triggered when
's.replacing' is set and not when the similar 's.sync' is set (which
is the case during resync and recovery - it means all devices need to
be read).
So schedule those writes when s.replacing is set as well.
In this case we cannot use "STRIPE\_INSYNC" to record that the
replacement has happened as that is needed for recording that any
parity calculation is complete. So introduce STRIPE\_REPLACED to
record if the replacement has happened.
For safety we should also check that STRIPE\_COMPUTE\_RUN is not set.
This has a similar effect to the "s.locked == 0" test. The latter
ensure that now IO has been flagged but not started. The former
checks if any parity calculation has been flagged by not started.
We must wait for both of these to complete before triggering the
'replace'.
Add a similar test to the subsequent check for "are we finished yet".
This possibly isn't needed (is subsumed in the STRIPE\_INSYNC test),
but it makes it more obvious that the REPLACE will happen before we
think we are finished.
Finally if a NeedReplace device is not UPTODATE then that is an
error. We really must trigger a warning.
This bug was introduced in commit 9a3e1101b827a59ac9036a672f5fa8d5279d0fe2
(md/raid5: detect and handle replacements during recovery.)
which introduced replacement for raid5.
That was in 3.3-rc3, so any stable kernel since then would benefit
from this fix.

md/raid1: fix bio handling problems in process\_checks()
commit 30bc9b53878a9921b02e3b5bc4283ac1c6de102a upstream.
Recent change to use bio\_copy\_data() in raid1 when repairing
an array is faulty.
The underlying may have changed the bio in various ways using
bio\_advance and these need to be undone not just for the 'sbio' which
is being copied to, but also the 'pbio' (primary) which is being
copied from.
So perform the reset on all bios that were read from and do it early.
This also ensure that the sbio->bi\_io\_vec[j].bv\_len passed to
memcmp is correct.
This fixes a crash during a 'check' of a RAID1 array. The crash was
introduced in 3.10 so this is suitable for 3.10-stable.

allowed a bit more than just that. It also allows devices to be added
to a read-write array and to end up skipping recovery.
This patch removes the offending piece of code pending a rewrite for a
subsequent release.
More specifically:
If the array has a bitmap, then the device will still need a bitmap
based resync ('saved\_raid\_disk' is set under different conditions
is a bitmap is present).
If the array doesn't have a bitmap, then this is correct as long as
nothing has been written to the array since the metadata was checked
by ->validate\_super. However there is no locking to ensure that there
was no write.
Bug was introduced in 3.10 and causes data corruption so
patch is suitable for 3.10-stable.

Since the IDT is referenced from a fixmap, make sure it is page aligned.
This avoids the risk of the IDT ever being moved in the bss and having
the mapping be offset, resulting in calling incorrect handlers. In the
current upstream kernel this is not a manifested bug, but heavily patched
kernels (such as those using the PaX patch series) did encounter this bug.

x86, suspend: Handle CPUs which fail to #GP on RDMSR
commit 5ff560fd48d5b3d82fa0c3aff625c9da1a301911 upstream.
There are CPUs which have errata causing RDMSR of a nonexistent MSR to
not fault. We would then try to WRMSR to restore the value of that
MSR, causing a crash. Specifically, some Pentium M variants would
have this problem trying to save and restore the non-existent EFER,
causing a crash on resume.
Work around this by making sure we can write back the result at
suspend time.
Huge thanks to Christian Sünkenberg for finding the offending erratum

xen-netfront: pull on receive skb may need to happen earlier
commit 093b9c71b6e450e375f4646ba86faed0195ec7df upstream.
Due to commit 3683243b ("xen-netfront: use \_\_pskb\_pull\_tail to ensure
linear area is big enough on RX") xennet\_fill\_frags() may end up
filling MAX\_SKB\_FRAGS + 1 fragments in a receive skb, and only reduce
the fragment count subsequently via \_\_pskb\_pull\_tail(). That's a
result of xennet\_get\_responses() allowing a maximum of one more slot to
be consumed (and intermediately transformed into a fragment) if the
head slot has a size less than or equal to RX\_COPY\_THRESHOLD.
Hence we need to adjust xennet\_fill\_frags() to pull earlier if we
reached the maximum fragment count - due to the described behavior of
xennet\_get\_responses() this guarantees that at least the first fragment
will get completely consumed, and hence the fragment count reduced.
In order to not needlessly call \_\_pskb\_pull\_tail() twice, make the
original call conditional upon the pull target not having been reached
yet, and defer the newly added one as much as possible (an alternative
would have been to always call the function right before the call to
xennet\_fill\_frags(), but that would imply more frequent cases of
needing to call it twice).

Btrfs: fix wrong write offset when replacing a device
commit 115930cb2d444a684975cf2325759cb48ebf80cc upstream.
Miao Xie reported the following issue:
The filesystem was corrupted after we did a device replace.
Steps to reproduce:
# mkfs.btrfs -f -m single -d raid10 ..
# mount
# btrfs replace start -rfB 1
# umount
# btrfsck
The reason for the issue is that we changed the write offset by mistake,
introduced by commit 625f1c8dc.
We read the data from the source device at first, and then write the
data into the corresponding place of the new device. In order to
implement the "-r" option, the source location is remapped using
btrfs\_map\_block(). The read takes place on the mapped location, and
the write needs to take place on the unmapped location. Currently
the write is using the mapped location, and this commit changes it
back by undoing the change to the write address that the aforementioned
commit added by mistake.

staging: comedi: COMEDI\_CANCEL ioctl should wake up read/write
commit 69acbaac303e8cb948801a9ddd0ac24e86cc4a1b upstream.
Comedi devices can do blocking read() or write() (or poll()) if an
asynchronous command has been set up, blocking for data (for read()) or
buffer space (for write()). Various events associated with the
asynchronous command will wake up the blocked reader or writer (or
poller). It is also possible to force the asynchronous command to
terminate by issuing a `COMEDI\_CANCEL` ioctl. That shuts down the
asynchronous command, but does not currently wake up the blocked reader
or writer (or poller). If the blocked task could be woken up, it would
see that the command is no longer active and return. The caller of the
`COMEDI\_CANCEL` ioctl could attempt to wake up the blocked task by
sending a signal, but that's a nasty workaround.
Change `do\_cancel\_ioctl()` to wake up the wait queue after it returns
from `do\_cancel()`. `do\_cancel()` can propagate an error return value
from the low-level comedi driver's cancel routine, but it always shuts
the command down regardless, so `do\_cancel\_ioctl()` can wake up he wait
queue regardless of the return value from `do\_cancel()`.

mutex for quite a long time).
There is a race condition if `comedi\_read()` or `comedi\_write()` is
running at the same time and for the same file object and comedi
subdevice as `do\_cmd\_ioctl()`. `do\_cmd\_ioctl()` sets the subdevice's
`busy` pointer to the file object way before it sets the `SRF\_RUNNING` flag
in the subdevice's `runflags` member. `comedi\_read() and
`comedi\_write()` check the subdevice's `busy` pointer is pointing to the
current file object, then if the `SRF\_RUNNING` flag is not set, will call
`do\_become\_nonbusy()` to shut down the asyncronous command. Bad things
can happen if the asynchronous command is being shutdown and set up at
the same time.
To prevent the race, don't set the `busy` pointer until
after the `SRF\_RUNNING` flag has been set. Also, make sure the mutex is
held in `comedi\_read()` and `comedi\_write()` while calling
`do\_become\_nonbusy()` in order to avoid moving the race condition to a
point within that function.
Change some error handling `goto cleanup` statements in `do\_cmd\_ioctl()`
to simple `return -ERRFOO` statements as a result of changing when the
`busy` pointer is set.

USB: global suspend and remote wakeup don't mix
commit e583d9db9960cf40e0bc8afee4946baa9d71596e upstream.
The hub driver was recently changed to use "global" suspend for system
suspend transitions on non-SuperSpeed buses. This means that we don't
suspend devices individually by setting the suspend feature on the
upstream hub port; instead devices all go into suspend automatically
when the root hub stops transmitting packets. The idea was to save
time and to avoid certain kinds of wakeup races.
Now it turns out that many hubs are buggy; they don't relay wakeup
requests from a downstream port to their upstream port if the
downstream port's suspend feature is not set (depending on the speed
of the downstream port, whether or not the hub is enabled for remote
wakeup, and possibly other factors).
We can't have hubs dropping wakeup requests. Therefore this patch
goes partway back to the old policy: It sets the suspend feature for a
port if the device attached to that port or any of its descendants is
enabled for wakeup. People will still be able to benefit from the
time savings if they don't care about wakeup and leave it disabled on
all their devices.
In order to accomplish this, the patch adds a new field to the usb\_hub
structure: wakeup\_enabled\_descendants is a count of how many devices
below a suspended hub are enabled for remote wakeup. A corresponding
new subroutine determines the number of wakeup-enabled devices at or
below an arbitrary suspended USB device.
This should be applied to the 3.10 stable kernel.

usb: dwc3: fix wrong bit mask in dwc3\_event\_type
commit 1974d494dea05ea227cb42f5e918828801e237aa upstream.
Per dwc3 2.50a spec, the is\_devspec bit is used to distinguish the
Device Endpoint-Specific Event or Device-Specific Event (DEVT). If the
bit is 1, the event is represented Device-Specific Event, then use
[7:1] bits as Device Specific Event to marked the type. It has 7 bits,
and we can see the reserved8\_31 variable name which means from 8 to 31
bits marked reserved, actually there are 24 bits not 25 bits between
that. And 1 + 7 + 24 = 32, the event size is 4 byes.
So in dwc3\_event\_type, the bit mask should be:
is\_devspec [0] 1 bit
type [7:1] 7 bits
reserved8\_31 [31:8] 24 bits

xhci: Avoid NULL pointer deref when host dies.
commit 203a86613fb3bf2767335659513fa98563a3eb71 upstream.
When the host controller fails to respond to an Enable Slot command, and
the host fails to respond to the register write to abort the command
ring, the xHCI driver will assume the host is dead, and call
usb\_hc\_died().
The USB device's slot\_id is still set to zero, and the pointer stored at
xhci->devs[0] will always be NULL. The call to xhci\_check\_args in
xhci\_free\_dev should have caught the NULL virt\_dev pointer.
However, xhci\_free\_dev is designed to free the xhci\_virt\_device
structures, even if the host is dead, so that we don't leak kernel
memory. xhci\_free\_dev checks the return value from the generic
xhci\_check\_args function. If the return value is -ENODEV, it carries on
trying to free the virtual device.
The issue is that xhci\_check\_args looks at the host controller state
before it looks at the xhci\_virt\_device pointer. It will return -ENIVAL
because the host is dead, and xhci\_free\_dev will ignore the return
value, and happily dereference the NULL xhci\_virt\_device pointer.
The fix is to make sure that xhci\_check\_args checks the xhci\_virt\_device
pointer before it checks the host state.
See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1203453 for
further details. This patch doesn't solve the underlying issue, but
will ensure we don't see any more NULL pointer dereferences because of
the issue.

usb: host: xhci: Enable XHCI\_SPURIOUS\_SUCCESS for all controllers with xhci 1.0
commit 07f3cb7c28bf3f4dd80bfb136cf45810c46ac474 upstream.
Xhci controllers with hci\_version > 0.96 gives spurious success
events on short packet completion. During webcam capture the
"ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD" was observed.
The same application works fine with synopsis controllers hci\_version 0.96.
The same issue is seen with Intel Pantherpoint xhci controller. So enabling
this quirk in xhci\_gen\_setup if controller verion is greater than 0.96.
For xhci-pci move the quirk to much generic place xhci\_gen\_setup.
Note from Sarah:
The xHCI 1.0 spec changed how hardware handles short packets. The HW
will notify SW of the TRB where the short packet occurred, and it will
also give a successful status for the last TRB in a TD (the one with the
IOC flag set). On the second successful status, that warning will be
triggered in the driver.
Software is now supposed to not assume the TD is not completed until it
gets that last successful status. That means we have a slight race
condition, although it should have little practical impact. This patch
papers over that issue.
It's on my long-term to-do list to fix this race condition, but it is a
much more involved patch that will probably be too big for stable. This
patch is needed for stable to avoid serious log spam.
This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that
contain the commit ad808333d8201d53075a11bc8dd83b81f3d68f0b "Intel xhci:
Ignore spurious successful event."
The patch will have to be modified for kernels older than 3.2, since
that kernel added the xhci\_gen\_setup function for xhci platform devices.
The correct conflict resolution for kernels older than 3.2 is to set
XHCI\_SPURIOUS\_SUCCESS in xhci\_pci\_quirks for all xHCI 1.0 hosts.

tracing: Remove locking trace\_types\_lock from tracing\_reset\_all\_online\_cpus()
commit 09d8091c024ec88d1541d93eb8ddb2bd5cf10c39 upstream.
Commit a82274151af "tracing: Protect ftrace\_trace\_arrays list in trace\_events.c"
added taking the trace\_types\_lock mutex in trace\_events.c as there were
several locations that needed it for protection. Unfortunately, it also
encapsulated a call to tracing\_reset\_all\_online\_cpus() which also takes
the trace\_types\_lock, causing a deadlock.
This happens when a module has tracepoints and has been traced. When the
module is removed, the trace events module notifier will grab the
trace\_types\_lock, do a bunch of clean ups, and also clears the buffer
by calling tracing\_reset\_all\_online\_cpus. This doesn't happen often
which explains why it wasn't caught right away.
Commit a82274151af was marked for stable, which means this must be
sent to stable too.

sd\_prep\_fn will allocate a larger CDB for the command via mempool\_alloc
for devices using DIF type 2 protection. This CDB was being freed

CDB into sd\_unprep\_fn instead, which is invoked after the request is
complete.
It is no longer necessary to call scsi\_print\_command separately for
this case as the ->cmnd will no longer be NULL in the normal code path.
Also removed conditional test for DIF type 2 when freeing the larger
CDB because the protection\_type could have been changed via sysfs while

ARM: 7722/1: zImage: Convert 32bits memory size and address from ATAG to 64bits DTB
commit faefd550c45d8d314e8f260f21565320355c947f upstream.
When CONFIG\_ARM\_APPENDED\_DTB is selected, if the bootloader provides
an ATAG\_MEM it replaces the memory size and the memory address in the
memory node of the device tree. In the case of a system which can
handle more than 4GB, the memory node cell size is 4: each data
(memory size and memory address) are 64 bits and then use 2 cells.
The current code in atags\_to\_fdt.c made the assumption of a cell size
of 2 (one cell for the memory size and one cell for the memory
address), this leads to an improper write of the data and ends with a
boot hang.
This patch writes the memory size and the memory address on the memory
node in the device tree depending of the size of the memory node (32
bits or 64 bits).
It has been tested in the 2 cases:
- with a dtb using skeleton.dtsi
- and with a dtb using skeleton64.dtsi

result was that the video frame buffers would be saved before they
contained the correct data.
Reintroduce the old behaviour for old clients.

iser-target: Fix session reset bug with RDMA\_CM\_EVENT\_DISCONNECTED
commit b2cb96494d83b894a43ba8b9023eead8ff50684b upstream.
This patch addresses a bug where RDMA\_CM\_EVENT\_DISCONNECTED may occur
before the connection shutdown has been completed by rx/tx threads,
that causes isert\_free\_conn() to wait indefinately on ->conn\_wait.
This patch allows isert\_disconnect\_work code to invoke rdma\_disconnect
when isert\_disconnect\_work() process context is started by client
session reset before isert\_free\_conn() code has been reached.
It also adds isert\_conn->conn\_mutex protection for ->state within
isert\_disconnect\_work(), isert\_cq\_comp\_err() and isert\_free\_conn()
code, along with isert\_check\_state() for wait\_event usage.
(v2: Add explicit iscsit\_cause\_connection\_reinstatement call
during isert\_disconnect\_work() to force conn reset)

zap\_pte\_range loops from @addr to @end. In the middle, if it runs out of
batching slots, TLB entries needs to be flushed for @start to @interim,
NOT @interim to @end.
Since ARC port doesn't use page free batching I can't test it myself but
this seems like the right thing to do.

# USN-2038-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

3 December 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)

  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file

creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash

value in a directory important to the victim. ([CVE-2012-5375](/security/CVE-2012-5375))

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to

run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to

connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](/security/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key\_socket implementation

in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine

potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](/security/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux

kernel when the IPV6\_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in

combination with the UDP\_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](/security/CVE-2013-4163))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-232-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-232.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-232.48)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# CVE 2013-2140

The dispatch\_discard\_io function in drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c in the Xen blkback implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.10.5 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (data loss) via filesystem write operations on a read-only disk that supports the (1) BLKIF\_OP\_DISCARD (aka discard or TRIM) or (2) SCSI UNMAP feature.

# USN-1944-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

6 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service by creating a

large number of files with names that have the same CRC32 hash value.

([CVE-2012-5374](/security/CVE-2012-5374))

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file

creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash

value in a directory important to the victim. ([CVE-2012-5375](/security/CVE-2012-5375))

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to

run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to

connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](/security/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key\_socket implementation

in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine

potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](/security/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux

kernel when the IPV6\_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in

combination with the UDP\_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](/security/CVE-2013-4163))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-40.62)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-40.62)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-40.62)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-40.62)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-40.62)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

```
We need to make sure that the device is not RO or that
the request is not past the number of sectors we want to
issue the DISCARD operation for.

This fixes [CVE-2013-2140](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qw94-9pv3-h4jx "CVE-2013-2140").

xen/blkback: Check device permissions before allowing OP\_DISCARDWe need to make sure that the device is not RO or that
the request is not past the number of sectors we want to
issue the DISCARD operation for.
This fixes CVE-2013-2140.

# USN-1947-1: Linux kernel (Quantal HWE) vulnerabilities

7 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service by creating a

large number of files with names that have the same CRC32 hash value.

([CVE-2012-5374](/security/CVE-2012-5374))

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file

creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash

value in a directory important to the victim. ([CVE-2012-5375](/security/CVE-2012-5375))

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to

run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to

connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](/security/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key\_socket implementation

in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine

potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](/security/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux

kernel when the IPV6\_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in

combination with the UDP\_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](/security/CVE-2013-4163))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-40.62~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-1943-1: Linux kernel (Raring HWE) vulnerabilities

6 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-raring](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-raring) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Raring

## Details

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to

run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to

connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](/security/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key\_socket implementation

in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine

potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](/security/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux

kernel when the IPV6\_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in

combination with the UDP\_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](/security/CVE-2013-4163))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-30-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-30.44~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-30.44~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-1943-1: Linux kernel (Raring HWE) vulnerabilities

6 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-raring](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-raring) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Raring

## Details

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to

run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to

connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](/security/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key\_socket implementation

in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine

potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](/security/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux

kernel when the IPV6\_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in

combination with the UDP\_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](/security/CVE-2013-4163))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-30-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-30.44~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-30.44~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
