## Analysis of CVE-2013-2140

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks in the `dispatch_discard_io` function within the Xen blkback (block backend) implementation in the Linux kernel. Specifically, when a guest OS is given read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM (BLKIF_OP_DISCARD) or SCSI UNMAP, there are insufficient checks to prevent a privileged user within the guest from issuing commands that can destroy data on the disk.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The primary weakness is the failure to verify if the guest OS is permitted to issue discard or unmap commands on a read-only disk. The `dispatch_discard_io` function in `drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c` did not validate the read-only status before processing the discard/unmap request.
*   **Abuse of TRIM/SCSI UNMAP:** The vulnerability leverages the TRIM/SCSI UNMAP functionality, designed to allow disk space reclamation, but is being misused on a disk where the guest user should not have write-like access.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Loss:**  A successful exploit allows a privileged user within a guest OS to destroy data on a disk that was intended to be read-only from the guest's perspective. This is because the guest OS can trigger a disk discard action, even though it doesn't have write permissions.
*  **Denial of Service (Data Loss):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service where data is lost from the guest's perspective.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation (within the guest):** A malicious or compromised user with privileged access within a Xen guest OS can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Guest OS to Host Disk:**  The attack allows the guest OS to affect data stored on the host system's disk, breaking isolation intended between the guest and host environment.
*   **Specific Storage Devices Required:** The targeted disk needs to support either BLKIF_OP_DISCARD (TRIM) or SCSI UNMAP for the exploit to work.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User in Guest OS:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges within the guest OS to issue disk commands, specifically those related to TRIM or SCSI UNMAP.
*   **Read-Only Disk Access:** The guest OS must be given access to a read-only disk by the hypervisor that supports TRIM/SCSI UNMAP.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Patch:** The fix was introduced by commit `604c499cbbcc3d5fe5fb8d53306aa0fae1990109`, which added checks to verify the read-only status of the disk before processing discard/unmap requests.
*   **Affected Systems:** The vulnerability primarily affects systems using Xen virtualization with Linux kernels prior to 3.10.5. Various Ubuntu releases were affected, but patched with kernel updates.
*   **Red Hat:** This issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as it has no support for `BLKIF_OP_DISCARD`.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity by Ubuntu.
