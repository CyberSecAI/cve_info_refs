Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of the `crypt()` function in `xdm` for password authentication when it is configured to use raw crypt authentication (not PAM or BSD Auth).
-  `glibc` version 2.17 and later can return a NULL pointer from the `crypt()` function under specific conditions, such as when an invalid salt is provided or when FIPS-140 is enabled and DES/MD5 encrypted passwords are used.  Specifically, `crypt()` returns `NULL` with `EINVAL` when the salt is invalid or with `EPERM` when DES/MD5 encryption is used on FIPS-140 enabled systems.
- `xdm` didn't check the return value of `crypt()`. A NULL return leads to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash of the `xdm` daemon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is the potential for a NULL pointer dereference due to not checking the return value of the `crypt()` function.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Error Handling:** The code did not validate the return from `crypt()` before using the returned pointer and thus did not handle the error case where it could return NULL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of the vulnerability results in the crash of the `xdm` daemon.
- **Local DoS:** On single-user console machines, this might only result in a return to the text console login.
- **Multi-user/Remote DoS:** On systems with multiple seats, remote XDMCP access, or X terminals, the crash can cause a denial of service for users on those other seats or terminals.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Invalid Password Input:** An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by attempting to log in with a password that results in a `NULL` return from the `crypt()` function, for example, by locking an account (prepended with !)
- **Specific System Configurations:** Systems using `glibc` 2.17 or higher, FIPS-140 enabled Linux systems are more susceptible due to the changed behavior of crypt().
- **Direct access to xdm:** This vulnerability can be triggered by providing login credentials through xdm's login prompt or via the XDMCP login protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to attempt to log into the system via `xdm`. This could be via:
    - The local console
    - Remote access through XDMCP
    - X terminals

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided `cgit.freedesktop.org` diff shows the fix. It includes an explicit check for a `NULL` return value from `crypt()` before dereferencing the returned pointer.
- The Mageia bug report confirms that their build of `xdm` was not vulnerable because it was configured with `--with-pam`. They tested the scenario by locking an account, which correctly resulted in an incorrect login message and not a crash.
- The `opensuse` mailing list message indicates that `glibc` 2.17 introduced the change in crypt()'s behavior that caused this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2013-2179 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in `xdm` that arises from a lack of error handling of the `crypt()` function's return value, particularly when used in conjunction with `glibc` 2.17 or higher, or under specific FIPS-140 configurations. The fix involves adding a NULL check before dereferencing the pointer returned from `crypt()`.
