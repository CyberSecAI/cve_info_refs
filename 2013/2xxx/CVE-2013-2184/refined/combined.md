# Movable Type 5.2.6 Release Notes

> This version of Movable Type was released June 5, 2013.

## New Functions

### New Responsive Web Design Theme “Eiger”

“Eiger” is especially suited for use with larger company websites and blogs. Along with Media Query (CSS) supported multi-device compatibility, logos, headers and banners, and navigation are all easily customizible with built-in Movable Type functions.

### The “Smartphone Option”

The optional “Smartphone Option” is now available bundled together with either Movable Type Professional or Movable Type Advanced. (As of now, the “Smartphone Option” can only be obtained through a bundle purchase.)

The “Smartphone Option” offers a version of the Movable Type admin screen that has been optimized for smartphones, tablets and other portable devices.

For more information on using the “Smartphone Option”, please refer to the “[Smartphone Option User Manual](http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/mt5/smartphoneoption/)” from “[Movable Type 5 documentation](http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/mt5/)”.

### Canonical Link Elements

Canonical elements can now be used with the MT tags [“MTCanonicalURL”](http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/appendices/tags/canonicalurl.html) and [“MTCanonicalLink”](http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/appendices/tags/canonicallink.html).

### Language settings expansion

The language in which a blog entry’s date is displayed can now be set seperately from the general blog language settings.(109305, 109542) The language option can be set by accessing “Date Language” from the blog entry date “Compose” option. Once set, the date for the blog entry will be displayed in the standard format for the specified language. In connection to this change, the following tags have also been added:

* [MTBlogDateLanguage](http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/appendices/tags/blogdatelanguage.html)
* [MTWebsiteDateLanguage](http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/appendices/tags/websitedatelanguage.html)

## Expanded Compatibility

The following browsers, programs and environments are now supported by Movable Type.

### Compatibility with the Internet Explorer 10 Desktop Application

MT now offers compatibility with the Internet Explorer 10 desktop application.

(Please see [“Internet Explorer 10 - Overview for IT Pros”](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846774.aspx) from the Microsoft website for more information on Internet Explorer 10.)

### Oracle 11g R2 Support

Movable Type Advanced now offers support for Oracle 11g R2.
### Termination of TypePad AntiSpam Bundle Sales

The TypePad AntiSpam plug-in is no longer being offered as part of a Movable Type bundle. In May of 2013, the TypePad AntiSpam service changed ownership from Say Media to Impermium. For more information, [please refer to the “Impermium FAQ Page”](https://impermium.zendesk.com/entries/23720766-Typepad-AntiSpam-Transition-FAQ).

Package        : movabletype-opensource
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2184 CVE-2014-9057 CVE-2015-1592
Debian Bug     : 712602 774192

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Movable Type, a
blogging system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-2184

    Unsafe use of Storable::thaw in the handling of comments to blog
    posts could allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary
    local Perl files or possibly remotely execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2014-9057

    Netanel Rubin from Check Point Software Technologies discovered a
    SQL injection vulnerability in the XML-RPC interface allowing
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2015-1592

    The Perl Storable::thaw function is not properly used, allowing
    remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local Perl files
    and possibly remotely execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.1.4+dfsg-4+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your movabletype-opensource packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# CVE request: MovableType before 5.2.6

---

*From*: John Lightsey <john () nixnuts net>

*Date*: Thu, 13 Jun 2013 22:50:24 -0500

---

```
Hi everyone,

The 5.2.6 release of MovableType fixed a vulnerability in the handling
of comments to blog posts. The 'comment_state' parameter is processed by
MovableType's unserialize() function which can be used to send data into
Storable::thaw().

As documented by the perl-security team recently, Storable::thaw is
unsafe to use on untrusted inputs.

<http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commit/664f237a84176c09b20b62dbfe64dd736a7ce05e>

The MovableType 5.2.6 release notes document the fix for this
vulnerability as:

"109458 Currently un-used parameters are unintentionally deleted when a
comment is posted"

<http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/appendices/release-notes/movable-type-526-release-notes.html>
