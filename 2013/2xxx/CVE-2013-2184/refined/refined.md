Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of `Storable::thaw` in Movable Type's handling of comments to blog posts. The `comment_state` parameter is processed by Movable Type's `unserialize()` function, which can be used to send data into `Storable::thaw()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is that `Storable::thaw` is used on untrusted input, making it possible for attackers to inject malicious data during the deserialization process.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Due to the unsafe deserialization, attackers can include and execute arbitrary local Perl files, potentially leading to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Movable Type. This could allow them to take full control of the system, steal sensitive data, or cause other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves sending malicious data through the `comment_state` parameter when submitting a comment to a blog post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to submit comments to a blog post.
- The attacker needs to craft malicious data that, when deserialized via `Storable::thaw`, leads to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was fixed in Movable Type version 5.2.6.
- The vulnerability is related to a change in perl behavior, where `Storable::thaw` was deemed unsafe for untrusted input.
- The Movable Type release notes mention "109458 Currently un-used parameters are unintentionally deleted when a comment is posted" as the fix, which is the result of fixing the unsafe unserialization.
