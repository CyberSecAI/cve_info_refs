Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `DefaultActionMapper` in Apache Struts 2 allowed for short-circuit navigation state changes using parameters prefixed with "redirect:" or "redirectAction:". These prefixes were intended for attaching navigational information to form buttons. However, the expressions following these prefixes were not properly validated, enabling manipulation to redirect users to arbitrary locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, where an attacker can manipulate the redirect target to point to an external, malicious site.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application lacked proper validation of the expressions following the "redirect:" and "redirectAction:" prefixes, making it vulnerable to exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing sites, malware distribution sites, or other malicious resources.
*   **Loss of User Trust:** Such redirects can erode user trust in the affected application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated URL Parameters:** The attack vector is through manipulated URL parameters. Attackers can craft URLs with "redirect:" or "redirectAction:" parameters followed by a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application server to send the manipulated requests.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP parameters and URL manipulation.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without needing valid user credentials.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability affects Apache Struts versions 2.0.0 to 2.3.15.
*   The fix involves completely removing the support for "redirect:"/"redirectAction:"-prefixed parameters in the `DefaultActionMapper`.
*   Applications using the "redirect:"/"redirectAction:" functionality will break after upgrading to Struts 2.3.15.1 or later. Developers need to replace such expressions with proper navigation rules.
*   Fujitsu also mentions this CVE affecting "Interstage Business Process Manager Analytics" and advises patching or using IPS to block URLs containing the parameters `action`, `redirect`, or `redirectAction`.
*   Oracle mentions the fix for this vulnerability (CVE-2013-2248) within their Critical Patch Updates for Oracle FLEXCUBE and Oracle WebCenter Sites products, noting that the issue is resolved by upgrading to Struts 2.3.15.3.
