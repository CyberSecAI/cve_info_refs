The provided content is related to CVE-2013-2792.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories' (SEL) real-time automation controllers (RTAC) when processing DNP3 protocol traffic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The SEL RTAC master does not properly validate input received via the DNP3 protocol.
- This lack of validation allows specially crafted DNP3 packets to cause the software to enter an infinite loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The RTAC device enters an infinite loop, causing the process to crash.
- In some cases, the DNP3 driver will automatically restart and resume communications.
- In more severe cases, the device's ALARM contact will assert, indicating a problem, and device configuration settings must be reloaded.

**Attack vectors:**
- **IP-based:** An attacker can send a specially crafted TCP packet over an IP-based network to the RTAC master.
- **Serial-based:** An attacker can send the crafted packet through a serial connection to the RTAC master, which requires physical access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **IP-based:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device. This could be achieved remotely, if the device is exposed.
- **Serial-based:** The attacker requires physical access to the master station or the ability to use social engineering to get access to the serial connection.
