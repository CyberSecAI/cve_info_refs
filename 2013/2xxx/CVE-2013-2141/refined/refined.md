  "CVE-2013-2141": {
    "description": "An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's tkill and tgkill system calls when used from compat processes. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive kernel memory.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an information leak in the `tkill` and `tgkill` system calls within the Linux kernel, specifically when used by compat processes (32-bit processes running on a 64-bit kernel).",

        "Information Leak",
        "Improper handling of data for compat processes"

      "impact": "A local user can exploit this vulnerability to leak kernel memory contents, potentially exposing sensitive data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local Access",
