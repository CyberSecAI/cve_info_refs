Based on the provided bugzilla entry, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-2103:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the OpenShift cartridge loading mechanism. The `/broker/rest/domains/dom/applications` endpoint accepts a URL that points to a cartridge file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted URL Retrieval:** The system does not restrict the provided URL to specific hosts, allowing requests to be sent to any arbitrary server.
- **Lack of Rate Limiting:** There are no rate limits imposed on the number or frequency of requests, which can be abused to overload the system or cause other impact.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Download:** Attackers can download large amounts of data from arbitrary servers using the OpenShift server as a proxy.
- **Firewall Bypass:**  Requests originating from the OpenShift server might bypass firewall rules that would otherwise block access to the external servers, allowing attackers to potentially access internal resources or systems that would otherwise be inaccessible from their location.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending malicious requests to the `/broker/rest/domains/dom/applications` OpenShift endpoint with URLs pointing to attacker-controlled servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send requests to the `/broker/rest/domains/dom/applications` endpoint. This might require access to an OpenShift instance or knowledge of a publicly exposed instance. No specific authentication requirements are mentioned, implying that access might be possible without special credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was marked as "CLOSED WONTFIX" with a moderate security impact, because Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2 was in the Production 1 Phase of its life cycle. This means the vulnerability will not be fixed in future updates.
