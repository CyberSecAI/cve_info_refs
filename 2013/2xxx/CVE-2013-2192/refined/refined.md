{
  "CVE-2013-2192": {
    "Description": "The Apache Hadoop RPC protocol is intended to provide bidirectional authentication between clients and servers. However, a malicious server or network attacker can unilaterally disable these authentication checks. This allows for potential reduction in the configured quality of protection of the RPC traffic, and privilege escalation if authentication credentials are passed over RPC.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in the Apache Hadoop RPC protocol allows a malicious server or network attacker to unilaterally disable bidirectional authentication checks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "The ability for a malicious server or network attacker to disable bidirectional authentication."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Potential reduction in the configured quality of protection of RPC traffic, and privilege escalation if authentication credentials are passed over RPC. This could lead to intercepted RPC traffic, including authentication credentials by an attacker",
      "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious server",
      "Network attacker"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Access to run tasks or containers on a cluster",
       "Ability to act as a server in the Hadoop RPC communication"
    ],
    "Additional Information": [
      "This flaw only affects users who have enabled Hadoop's Kerberos security features."
   ]
