Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2929:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2013-2929 and describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to the `get_dumpable()` function within the ptrace subsystem. It details that an unprivileged local user could bypass intended ptrace restrictions and obtain potentially sensitive information when 'fs.suid\_dumpable' was set to 2. This description aligns with the known vulnerability, making the content highly relevant.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The root cause is the incorrect interpretation of the return value of the `get_dumpable()` function in the `ptrace` subsystem. The function's return value is an integer and not a boolean, but the code logic was treating it as a boolean value.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Incorrect logic in interpreting the `get_dumpable()` return value, leading to insufficient checks on ptrace permissions. Specifically the comparison against SUID\_DUMP\_DISABLE(0) instead of against SUID\_DUMP\_USER(1).

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A local, unprivileged user can bypass intended ptrace restrictions.
    *   This bypass allows the user to potentially obtain sensitive information from the kernel memory.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An unprivileged local user
    *   The system setting 'fs.suid\_dumpable' must be set to 2

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The content provides more context than the basic CVE description, specifying that the incorrect logic affected code related to kernel/ptrace.c and arch/ia64/include/asm/processor.h.

*   The provided patches from kernel.org, particularly commit `d049f74f2dbe71354d43d393ac3a188947811348`, show the exact code changes to fix the problem and clearly explain the faulty logic.

*   Red Hat's security advisories (RHSA-2014:0100, RHSA-2014:0159, RHSA-2014:0285, RHSA-2018:1252) confirm that they are addressing the CVE-2013-2929 by updating the kernel packages for their respective products (MRG Realtime 2, RHEL 6, RHEL 5, RHEL 5.9).

*   Ubuntu's USN notices (USN-2111-1, USN-2114-1, USN-2115-1, USN-2128-1, USN-2129-1) also confirm that they are addressing CVE-2013-2929 in their kernel updates for affected Ubuntu releases (Ubuntu 10.04, Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu 13.10)

*   The bugzilla entries (1028148 and 1033530) also confirm the fix for CVE-2013-2929 in the kernel and that Red Hat is working to address the vulnerability.

*   The github commit message also contains information about how to fix this: *"Correct logic: if (dumpable != SUID\_DUMP\_USER) {  } or if (dumpable != 1) {  } "*
