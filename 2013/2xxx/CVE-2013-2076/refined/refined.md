Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inconsistent behavior of XSAVE/XRSTOR instructions on AMD processors compared to Intel processors when an exception is pending. Specifically, on AMD processors, these instructions only save/restore the FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an exception is pending. This is inconsistent with Intel processors and was not correctly handled in the original Xen implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inconsistent handling of XSAVE/XRSTOR instructions on AMD processors when exceptions are pending.
-  Failure to properly save/restore all relevant floating-point registers, leading to an information leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** A malicious guest domain can potentially access sensitive information, such as cryptographic keys, from other domains by examining the partially saved/restored floating-point register state.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. A malicious guest domain within the Xen hypervisor can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control of a guest domain running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor instance.
-  The attacker's guest domain and the victim domain must be running on an affected AMD processor with XSAVE/XRSTOR capability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to AMD processors supporting XSAVE/XRSTOR (family 15h and up).
- Systems running Xen 4.0 and later are vulnerable.
-  Xen 4.0.2 through 4.0.4 and 4.1.x have XSAVE support disabled by default, making them non-vulnerable unless explicitly enabled.
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2006-1056 concerning FXSAVE/FXRSTOR on AMD processors.
- Mitigation is possible by disabling XSAVE support via the "no-xsave" hypervisor command line option.
- Patches were provided to fix the issue.
