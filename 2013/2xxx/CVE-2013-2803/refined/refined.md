Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to generate passphrases in ProSoft Technology's RadioLinx ControlScape software.
*   The software uses standard C Run-Time libraries `srand` and `rand` calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cryptographically Weak PRNG:**  The use of `srand` and `rand` without proper seeding leads to predictable passphrase generation.
*   **Predictable Default Values:**  The PRNG generates predictable default passphrases when the same seed is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers can predict the automatically generated passwords, which makes brute-force attacks significantly faster.
*   **Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to the targeted systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Moderate Skill:** The attacker needs a moderate level of skill to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-2803 with a CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).
*   The vulnerability exists in RadioLinx ControlScape versions prior to FH v6.00.040.
*   A firmware patch (v6.00.040) has been released by ProSoft Technology to address the vulnerability.
*   Changing the default seed passphrase will increase the entropy of the passphrase generation.
