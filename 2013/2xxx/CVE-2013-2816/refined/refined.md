Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Cooper Power Systems SMP Gateway DNP3 component has an improper input validation vulnerability. Specifically, it does not correctly validate input, leading to potential crashes or service disruptions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of input within the DNP3 protocol components of the SMP Gateway.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Device Reboot:** A specially crafted packet can cause the SMP Gateway to reboot. This can disrupt operations until the device restarts and communication resumes.
- **Communication Link Failure:** A crafted packet can cause a communications link to fail. While other services remain operational, the attacked link becomes unresponsive, requiring a manual reset in some cases for serial-connected devices.
    - IP-Based:  Communications will automatically be reestablished when the master station attempts to reconnect to the unresponsive link
    - Serial Based:  The attacked connection may require manual reset via maintenance tools.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Serial Connection:** For serial connected devices, the vulnerability can be exploited with physical access to the SMP Gateway. This could involve an attacker gaining local access.
- **TCP Packets:** Both IP-Based and Serial based devices are vulnerable to specially crafted packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Serial Connection:**
    - **Physical Access:** Physical access to the serial connection of the SMP Gateway is required.
    - **High Skill:** A high level of skill is needed due to the physical access and potential social engineering required.
- **IP-based:**
    - **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send TCP packets on an IP-based network.
    - **Moderate Skill:** Crafting the specific TCP packet requires a moderate level of attacker skill.

**Additional Details**
- CVSS v2 base score of 4.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).
- Cooper Power Systems has released a new firmware to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Mitigation includes only allowing connection from specific IP addresses and blocking DNP3 traffic from traversing onto business or corporate networks through the use of an IPS or firewall.
