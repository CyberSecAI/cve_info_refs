Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `DiskFileItem` class of Apache Tomcat/JBossWeb. Specifically, the `readObject` method within this class has a flaw related to handling null bytes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Poison Null Byte Flaw:** The `DiskFileItem` class incorrectly handles null bytes in filenames during deserialization, allowing for path manipulation.
*   **Insecure Deserialization:**  The core issue is that a server deserializing a crafted `DiskFileItem` object is vulnerable. While the Tomcat team considers untrusted deserialization inherently insecure, Red Hat considered the flaw in `DiskFileItem` exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** A remote attacker can write arbitrary content to any location on the server's file system that is accessible to the user under which the application server process runs. This could include overwriting critical system files, deploying malicious scripts, or exfiltrating data.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious JSP file, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution. (This is more specifically addressed in the duplicate CVE-2013-4444)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by supplying a crafted serialized instance of the `DiskFileItem` class.
*   **Deserialization:** The server must deserialize the attacker-controlled data, making the application vulnerable. This typically involves applications accepting serialized data from user input or an untrusted source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Supply Serialized Data:** The attacker needs to be able to send a serialized instance of `DiskFileItem` to the vulnerable server. This implies the server is deserializing data from an untrusted source.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerable Class:** The attacker needs to craft a serialized `DiskFileItem` object containing the malicious filename and content.
*   **User privileges on server:** The attacker gains the privileges of the user that runs the application server process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Apache Tomcat team did not consider this a valid security flaw, stating that applications performing untrusted deserialization are inherently insecure and should not be supported by the Tomcat framework.
*   Red Hat, however, considered it a security flaw within Tomcat/JBossWeb.
*   The issue was addressed in Tomcat via a code cleanup, specifically by removing `implements Serializable` from the `FileItem` interface to prevent deserialization-based attacks on this class.

This information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its impact, and how an attacker could exploit it, which is more detailed than a typical CVE description.
