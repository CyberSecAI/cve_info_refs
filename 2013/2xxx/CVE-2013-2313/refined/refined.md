Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the session fixation vulnerability in EC-CUBE (CVE-2013-2313):

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way EC-CUBE handles session parameters. Specifically, the application was using `$_REQUEST` to initialize form parameters, which includes both GET and POST data. This allowed an attacker to inject a session identifier via GET parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Session Fixation:** The primary vulnerability is session fixation. The application was vulnerable to an attacker injecting a session ID through the URL and tricking a user into using it, leading to session hijacking.
-   Insecure Parameter Handling:  The code was using the `$_REQUEST` array, which merges GET, POST, and COOKIE data, instead of explicitly using `$_POST` when handling parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **User Impersonation:** A successful attack allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to impersonate a legitimate user of the EC-CUBE application.
-   **Information Disclosure/Alteration:** By impersonating a user, the attacker can potentially access private information associated with that user or even modify it.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is carried out remotely via HTTP requests.
-   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user to use a crafted URL containing the attacker's chosen session ID. This can be achieved by enticing them to click a malicious link or by other social engineering methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or access to the server.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to interact with a specially crafted URL.

**Technical Details from Vendor Fix Information**

*   The fix involves modifying the `LC_Page_Cart.php` file to use `$_POST` instead of `$_REQUEST` when initializing form parameters:
    ```php
    // Before
    $objFormParam = $this->lfInitParam($_REQUEST);

    // After
    $objFormParam = $this->lfInitParam($_POST);
    ```
*   Mobile devices are handled by checking for `cart_no` and `cartKey` in `$_GET` and setting these as values if present.
    ```php
    if(SC_Display_Ex::detectDevice() == DEVICE_TYPE_MOBILE) {
        if(isset($_GET['cart_no'])) $objFormParam->setValue('cart_no', $_GET['cart_no']);
        if(isset($_GET['cartKey'])) $objFormParam->setValue('cartKey', $_GET['cartKey']);
    }
    ```
*  Error handling was added to prevent the execution if invalid parameters are present.
    ```php
    // エラーチェック
    $arrError = $objFormParam->checkError();
    if(isset($arrError) && !empty($arrError)) {
        SC_Utils_Ex::sfDispSiteError(CART_NOT_FOUND);
        SC_Response_Ex::actionExit();
    }
    ```
*   An additional fix (relevant to 2.12.x onwards) was implemented to remove `EXIST_CHECK` from the quantity parameter definition
    ```php
    // Before
    $objFormParam->addParam('数量', 'quantity', INT_LEN, 'n', array('EXIST_CHECK', 'ZERO_CHECK', 'NUM_CHECK', 'MAX_LENGTH_CHECK'));

    // After
    $objFormParam->addParam('数量', 'quantity', INT_LEN, 'n', array('ZERO_CHECK', 'NUM_CHECK', 'MAX_LENGTH_CHECK'));
    ```

**Summary**

The session fixation vulnerability in EC-CUBE allowed attackers to hijack user sessions by injecting a session identifier through the URL, leading to potential information disclosure and unauthorized modification of data. The fix involved using the POST request parameters and properly handling mobile devices, coupled with better error handling.
