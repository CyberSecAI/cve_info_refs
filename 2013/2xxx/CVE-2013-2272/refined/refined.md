{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2013-2272": [
      {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `CTxMemPool::accept()` method skips a 'penny-flooding' protection if a transaction is from a wallet owned by the user. This check is performed using `IsFromMe` / `IsMine` functions.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that the 'penny-flooding' protection is bypassed if the transaction is associated with a wallet owned by the node, which allows an attacker to use this behavior as an oracle to determine which addresses are owned by a peer.",
         "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can discover which of the addresses are owned by a peer, thus revealing the peer's public addresses.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends specially crafted transactions with very low fees and a big size to the victim node.  By observing which transactions cause a disconnection, the attacker can infer which transaction outputs belong to the victim's wallet.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the victim node and send transactions. The attacker may also need to reconnect to the same node multiple times, possibly from different IPs, due to DoS protections."
