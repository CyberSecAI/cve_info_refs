  "CVE-2013-2164": {
    "description": "Linux kernel built with a cdrom drive support is vulnerable to an information leakage flaw. It could occur while performing cdrom_ioctl operations via generic_packet() interface. A user/program could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.",
    "root_cause": "The `mmc_ioctl_cdrom_read_data` function in `drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c` allocates a memory area with `kmalloc` but does not initialize it. If the CD-ROM drive malfunctions during a read operation, the allocated buffer is only partially filled and then copied to userspace using copy_to_user, thus exposing uninitialized kernel memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leakage",
      "Uninitialized Memory"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user or program could read uninitialized kernel memory by using the `cdrom_ioctl` interface with a malfunctioning CD-ROM drive, leading to an information leak.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access via crafted `cdrom_ioctl` operations.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user and able to perform cdrom ioctl operations and the system needs a cdrom drive",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is in `drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c`, specifically `mmc_ioctl_cdrom_read_data()` function. The fix replaces `kmalloc` with `kzalloc` to ensure the buffer is zeroed before being copied to user space.  The vulnerability can only be exploited with a malfunctioning cdrom drive."
