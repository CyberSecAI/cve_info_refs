Xpient Cash Drawer Operation Vulnerability

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Xpient Cash Drawer Operation Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-0517
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/xpient-cash-drawer-operation-vulnerability
Date published: 2013-06-05
Date of last update: 2013-06-05
Vendors contacted: XPIENT Solutions
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Input validation error [CWE-20]
Impact: Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2013-2571

3. *Vulnerability Description*

A security vulnerability was found in Xpient POS system running an
instance of Iris 3.8 software [1]; the POS cash drawer could be remotely
triggered to open if a malicious agent has access to the POS network and
is allowed to send a crafted message to the POS terminal hosting the
cash drawer. The malicious agent could be malware which operates from
any device on the POS network or an unauthorized device connected to the
physical POS network.

No Authentication or encryption layer is required to exploit this
vulnerability. As a result, the cash drawer opens and its content is
physically accessible.

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . Iris 3.8 build 1052.
   . Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. *Non-Vulnerable Packages*

   . Iris 3.8 build 1548 or higher.

6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Xpient notifies that this vulnerability has been corrected in IRIS v3.8
build 1548, notified their active customers of this concern and provided
them with guidance. Security Bulletin XS130521, May 21st 2013.

Enabling a software firewall (e.g. Windows Firewall) on the POS Terminal
to deny incoming traffic from reaching the cash drawer functions on the
terminal will also prevent remote attacks.

For further information contact vendor via the official email address
for product security inquiries which is: padss [at] xpient [dot] com.

7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Matthew Bergin from
Core Security Technologies.

8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The analyzed POS system running an instance of Iris 3.8 build 1052 was
found to be bound to several TCP ports. The services using these ports
are proprietary to Xpient and do not run OSS code. One TCP port (7510)
was accessible without any authentication or layer of encryption
required to execute code which triggered specific functionality. This
was abused in order to send a specific command to the service which
would in turn cause the cash drawer peripheral to unlock and open
revealing the contents.

The command used consists of two integers separated with a single
whitespace:

/-----
/bin/echo 1 1 || /bin/nc <POS-IP>: 7510
-----/

8.1. *Proof of Concept*

The following Python script can be used to exploit this vulnerability.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
