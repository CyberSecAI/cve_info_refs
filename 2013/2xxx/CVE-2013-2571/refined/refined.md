Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2571:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an input validation error in the Xpient POS system's Iris 3.8 software. Specifically, the software does not properly validate input before processing commands related to the cash drawer operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Authentication/Encryption:** The vulnerable TCP port (7510) used for cash drawer control lacks any authentication or encryption, allowing unauthenticated and unencrypted commands to be sent to it.
- **Input Validation Error:** The system accepts a simple command ("1 1\n") via the network which directly triggers the cash drawer to open without proper authorization or verification of the command's legitimacy. This suggests that the application does not properly validate or sanitize this input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Bypass:** The vulnerability allows a malicious actor to bypass security measures and directly trigger the cash drawer to open.
- **Physical Access to Cash:** The primary impact is the unauthorized opening of the cash drawer, which exposes the physical cash contents to theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs network access to the POS system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Direct Command Injection:** The attacker sends a specific crafted command (two integers separated by a whitespace: "1 1\n") to the vulnerable TCP port (7510) of the targeted POS system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the POS network.
- **Ability to Send TCP Packets:** The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary TCP packets to the target POS system, specifically to port 7510.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials or authorization to execute the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Iris 3.8 build 1052, and potentially other versions of the software.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Iris 3.8 build 1548 or higher.
- A Python proof-of-concept (PoC) script was developed by Core Security Technologies to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The advisory also mentions that enabling a software firewall on the POS terminal to restrict incoming traffic on the cash drawer functions can prevent remote attacks.

This information provides significantly more detail than the standard CVE description, outlining the technical specifics, exploitation methods and mitigation strategies.
