{
  "CVE-2013-2237": {
    "Root cause": "The `key_notify_policy_flush` function in `net/key/af_key.c` in the Linux kernel did not initialize the `satype` field of the `sadb_msg` structure.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to uninitialized `satype` field."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users could read potentially sensitive kernel memory by reading broadcast messages from the notify_policy interface of an IPSec key_socket.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with access to PF_KEY key sockets."
  }
}
