- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in Schweitzer Engineering Laboratoriesâ€™ (SEL) real-time automation controllers (RTAC). The device does not validate or incorrectly validates input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation (CWE-20) which leads to the RTAC entering an infinite loop, causing a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The RTAC master device can be sent into an infinite loop. In some conditions, the DNP3 driver will automatically restart and resume communications. In more severe conditions, the device's ALARM contact will assert, indicating a problem, and the device's configuration settings must be reloaded.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - IP-Based: A specially crafted TCP packet sent from the master station on an IP-based network.
  - Serial-Based: Requires physical access to the master station to send the malicious data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - IP-Based: Network access to the affected device, requiring a moderate skill level to craft the malicious packet.
  - Serial-Based: Physical access to the device or a high level of social engineering to gain access.
