The provided content relates to CVE-2013-2791.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in MatrikonOPC's SCADA DNP3 OPC Server. Specifically, the server fails to properly handle malformed DNP3 packets received from an outstation device after a successful connection.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation. The server crashes when it encounters a malformed DNP3 packet from a connected outstation device.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to the application on the master server crashing, which in turn disrupts OPC communication with the outstation device. This can potentially cause a denial-of-service condition.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote. An attacker could send a malformed DNP3 packet to the server after it connects to an outstation.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have moderate skill, the ability to connect to a device, and send crafted DNP3 packets.
