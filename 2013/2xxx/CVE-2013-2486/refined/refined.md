Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2486:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the RELOAD dissector in Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The RELOAD dissector could enter an infinite loop when processing certain malformed packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to excessive CPU resource consumption, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could inject a specially crafted, malformed RELOAD packet onto the network.
- Alternatively, an attacker could convince a user to open a malicious packet capture file (pcap) containing the malformed packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to either inject packets onto the network being analyzed by Wireshark or to trick a user into opening a malicious capture file.
- The attacker doesn't require any special privileges other than those associated with network access or the ability to send a file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.8.0 to 1.8.5.
- The fix is included in version 1.8.6 and later.
- This issue is identified by "wnpa-sec-2013-21" within Wireshark's security advisories.
- The vulnerability is related to, and fixed in conjunction with, CVE-2013-2487, indicating that they may be closely related or have the same underlying root cause within the RELOAD dissector.
