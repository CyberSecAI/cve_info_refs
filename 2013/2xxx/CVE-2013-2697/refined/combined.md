## Description

### General Usage

1. You Need To Re-Generate The Permalink `WP-Admin -> Settings -> Permalinks -> Save Changes`
2. To embed a specific file to be downloaded into a post/page, use `[download id="2"]` where 2 is your file id.
3. To embed multiple files to be downloaded into a post/page, use `[download id="1,2,3"]` where 1,2,3 are your file ids.
4. To limit the number of embedded downloads shown for each post in a post stream, use the `stream_limit` option.
   1. Example: `[download id="2" stream_limit="4"]`
   2. This will only display the first 4 downloads for the post when rendered in a post stream, and display the full list of downloads when viewing the single post.
5. To sort embedded downloads, use the `sort_by` and `sort_order` options.
   1. Example: `[download id="2" sort_by="file_id" sort_order="asc"]`
   2. This will sort the embedded downloads by file ID in ascending order.
   3. Valid values for `sort_by` are: `file_id`, `file`, `file_name`, `file_size`, `file_date`, and `file_hits`
6. To choose what to display within the embedded file, use `[download id="1" display="both"]` where 1 is your file id and both will display both the file name and file desccription, whereas name will only display the filename. Note that this will overwrite the “Download Embedded File” template you have in your Download Templates.
7. To embed files as well as categories, use `[download id="1,2,3" category="4,5,6"]` where 1,2,3 are your file id and 4,5,6 are your category ids.
8. If you are using Default Permalinks, the file direct download link will be `http://yoursite.com/index.php?dl_id=2`. If you are using Nice Permalinks, the file direct download link will be `http://yoursite.com/download/2/`, where yoursite.com is your WordPress URL and 2 is your file id.
9. The direct download category link will be `http://yoursite.com/downloads/?dl_cat=3`, where yoursite.com is your WordPress URL, downloads is your Downloads Page name and 3 is your download category id.
10. In order to upload the files straight to the downloads folder, the folder must be first CHMOD to 777. You can specify which folder to be the downloads folder in Download Options.
11. You can configure the Download Options in `WP-Admin -> Downloads -> Download Options`
12. You can configure the Download Templates in `WP-Admin -> Downloads -> Download Templates`

### Downloads Page

1. Go to `WP-Admin -> Pages -> Add New`
2. Type any title you like in the post’s title area
3. If you `ARE` using nice permalinks, after typing the title, WordPress will generate the permalink to the page. You will see an ‘Edit’ link just beside the permalink.
4. Click ‘Edit’ and type in `downloads` in the text field and click ‘Save’.
5. Type `[page_download]` in the post’s content area.
6. You can also use `[page_download category="1"]`, this will display all downloads in Category ID 1.
7. Click ‘Publish’

### Download Stats (With Widgets)

1. Go to `WP-Admin -> Appearance -> Widgets`
2. The widget name is `Downloads`.

### [No way to see “who can see what?” – major flaw](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-way-to-see-who-can-see-what-major-flaw/)

We did a lot of research into the right plugin for this task, but there are some features you assume a pluign can just do.
Like having a car. You assume it has a speedo, or that you can move the side mirrors. You never ask that. So we never asked the question: Can we as Manager of the Download Manager, see on a screen, what someone can view in their downloads?
There is one way to do it, but if you have 200, 300, 3000 clients, their fix is, to create a page for EACH client…. that’s their answer.
There is no list of users, on which you can click one, and view all their downloads.For a premium product, this is a staggering flaw.
So let’s say you run a health and safety business, and each client gets their safety reports.You have no means to find out, if Company A was sent their document in their uploads.
I mean, there is one way, but open to flaw yourself. By naming the Download document package correctly. But surely a list of users, you click the user and view all their downloads.
Why is that not in the system already???

NOT ONLY THAT THEY DID NOT REFUND THE MONEY THAT THEY WERE LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO DO DURING 14DAYS PERIOD AFTER PURCHASING, AFTER THEIR PLUGINS HAD PROBLEMS TO FUNCTION, THEY asked for logins to fix it and they messed the whole website up. Will never do business again with them they just take your money and run away, Plugins are coded by idiots, it’s impossible to combine it to modern plugins or themes, they keep telling you to buy more plugins to make it work as it should. Seriously stay away from them.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
