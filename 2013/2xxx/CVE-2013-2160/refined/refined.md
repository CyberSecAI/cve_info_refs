Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-2160:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way the Apache CXF StAX parser implementation processes XML files. The parser did not enforce limits on various aspects of the XML structure, such as the number of elements, attributes, and nesting levels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation and resource management in the Apache CXF StAX parser. Specifically, the parser doesn't limit:
* The number of elements in an XML document
* The number of attributes per element
* The nesting depth of the XML document

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit leads to a Denial of Service (DoS). By providing specially crafted XML files, an attacker can cause:
* Excessive CPU consumption
* Excessive memory consumption, potentially leading to JVM running out of memory

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted XML file to a web service that utilizes the vulnerable Apache CXF StAX parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary XML data to a vulnerable web service that uses the affected Apache CXF library. No specific user privileges or internal network access are needed, just the ability to communicate with the web service.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed by upgrading to Apache CXF versions 2.5.10, 2.6.7, or 2.7.4 (or later) which use Woodstox 4.2.0 as the streaming XML parser, which enforces limits preventing these attacks.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Andreas Falkenberg of SEC Consult Deutschland GmbH, and Christian Mainka, Juraj Somorovsky and Joerg Schwenk of Ruhr-University Bochum.
*   This vulnerability affects multiple products using Apache CXF, including Red Hat Fuse ESB Enterprise and Red Hat JBoss Fuse.

The provided information is more descriptive than the official CVE description, specifically by providing the root cause analysis, the specific weaknesses within the parser, and the exact mechanisms by which an attacker could cause a denial-of-service.
