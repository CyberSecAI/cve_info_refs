RHSA-2013:1028 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2013-07-09
Updated:
2013-07-09
# RHSA-2013:1028 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up patch 1, which fixes multiple security
issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Fuse ESB Enterprise, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides an integration
platform.

This release of Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up patch 1 is an update to
Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 and includes bug fixes. Refer to the readme file
included with the patch files for information about the bug fixes.

The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. (CVE-2012-5575)

Note: Automatic checks to prevent CVE-2012-5575 are only run when
WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security requirements. It is best
practice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce security requirements.

A flaw in JRuby's JSON gem allowed remote attacks by creating different
types of malicious objects. For example, it could initiate a denial of
service attack through resource consumption by using a JSON document to
create arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected. It could
also be exploited to create internal objects which could allow a SQL
injection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)

It was discovered that JRuby's REXML library did not properly restrict XML
entity expansion. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of
service by tricking a Ruby application using REXML to read text nodes from
specially-crafted XML content, which will result in REXML consuming large
amounts of system memory. (CVE-2013-1821)

Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the way the Apache CXF
StAX parser implementation processed certain XML files. If a web service
utilized the StAX parser, a remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted XML file that, when processed, would lead to excessive
CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2013-2160)

Note: Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 ships JRuby as part of the camel-ruby
component, which allows users to define Camel routes in Ruby. The default
use of JRuby in Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 does not appear to expose either
CVE-2013-0269 or CVE-2013-1821. If the version of JRuby shipped with Fuse
ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 was used to build a custom application, then these
flaws could be exposed.

Red Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj
Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575; Ruby
on Rails upstream for reporting CVE-2013-0269; and Andreas Falkenberg of
SEC Consult Deutschland GmbH, and Christian Mainka, Juraj Somorovsky and
Joerg Schwenk of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2013-2160.
Upstream acknowledges Thomas Hollstegge of Zweitag and Ben Murphy as the
original reporters of CVE-2013-0269.

All users of Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up
patch 1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-29 13:16:20 UTC  ``` Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the way StAX parser implementation of Apache CXF, an open-source web services framework, performed processing of certain XML files. If a web service application utilized the services of the StAX parser, a remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when processed by the application would lead to excessive system resources (CPU cycles, memory) consumption by that application.  References: [1] <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/WSTX-287> [2] <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/WSTX-285>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-27 11:22:23 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2013-2160.txt.asc>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-27 11:30:12 UTC  ``` Upstream patch (picks up Woodstox 4.2.0 as the streaming XML parser):   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1460428>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-27 11:53:14 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the cxf package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17 and 18. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-27 12:11:50 UTC  ``` Regarding the jbossws-cxf packages in Fedora I am not sure if they are affected by this or not (someone more familiar with the jbossws-cxf code please advise).  I will file Fedora child bugs for cxf and jbossws-cxf packages, once jbossws-cxf doubt is cleared.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-27 14:58:22 UTC  ```  Created cxf tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 979086](show_bug.cgi?id=979086 "CLOSED ERRATA - cxf: CVE-2013-2160 cxf, jbossws-cxf, apache-cxf: Multiple denial of service flaws in the StAX parser [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-09 17:37:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0  Via RHSA-2013:1028 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1028.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c13)  Fedora Update System    2013-08-10 20:01:23 UTC  ``` cxf-2.6.9-1.fc18, jacorb-2.3.1-8.fc18, wss4j-1.6.10-1.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

# Security Contacts and Procedures

Red Hat takes security very seriously, and we aim to take immediate action to
address serious security-related problems that involve our products or
services.

Please report any suspected security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service to Red Hat Product Security at secalert@redhat.com. You can use our [GPG key](#contact) to communicate with us securely.

To report an issue in any Red Hat branded website or online service, please contact Red Hat Information Security at site-security@redhat.com.

## When to contact Red Hat Product Security

You should contact Red Hat Product Security if:

* You think there might be a security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service.
* You want to provide feedback about our standards of service and performance. If you feel your security concern is not dealt with in a satisfactory manner, please contact secalert@redhat.com.

In all other cases, you should contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/).

You should contact Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement if:

* You are unsure about how a known vulnerability affects a Red Hat product or service.
* You wish to report an issue in a language other than English.
* You require technical assistance for a security function (for example, "How do I configure my firewall?").
* You need help upgrading packages due to security alerts. (Refer to "How do I apply package updates from the Red Hat Network?" for information on upgrading packages.)
* Your issue is not security related.

In any of these cases, please contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/) instead.

## Who reads email sent to secalert@redhat.com?

Only members of Red Hat Product Security, a restricted
and carefully chosen group of Red Hat employees, will have access to
material sent to the secalert@redhat.com address. No outside users can subscribe to this list.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Offerings

Red Hat Product Security welcomes and encourages all potential vulnerability submissions. For us to provide the best customer service and address issues in a timely manner, please provide the following information, if known:

* The version number of the affected component, such as the rpm package, container image, and java component.
* The environment and corresponding version(s) where the issue was discovered, for example, the operating system's name, version, architecture, or container platform.
* The steps to reproduce, if available.
* The ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability on a system.
* Is the vulnerability already known to the public? If not, when is the planned date for disclosure?
* The immediate impact if an attacker exploits the vulnerability, such as a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.

## How to contact us securely

Red Hat Product Security uses an OpenPGP key to secure our email communications. Mail sent to secalert@redhat.com can be encrypted with this public key. We expect to change the key we use from time to time. Should we change the key, the previous keys will be revoked, and the [rhsa-announce](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhsa-announce) mailing list will be notified of the change.

#### DCE3823597F5EAC4: Red Hat, Inc. (Product Security)

This key is used for communicating securely with Red Hat Product Security and for signing the security advisories posted to mailing lists.

**Download:** [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/security/data/97f5eac4.txt)

**Fingerprint:** 77E7 9ABE 9367 3533 ED09 EBE2 DCE3 8235 97F5 EAC4

Please do not send messages encrypted with this public key to any address
other than security@redhat.com and secalert@redhat.com. We are unable to accept any non–security-related email that is encrypted with this public key.

## How we respond

Email sent to secalert@redhat.com is read and
acknowledged with a non-automated response within three working
days. For issues that are complicated and require significant attention, we will open an investigation and will provide you with a mechanism to check the status of our progress at any time.

Any information you share with us about security issues that are
not public knowledge is kept confidential within Red Hat. It is not
passed on to any third party without your permission.

## Notifications

Red Hat does not provide an advance notification service. Security
advisories are available from [Red Hat Product Security](/site/security/updates/) and via the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/site/security/updates/active/).

## Common Criteria Timely Updates

Refer to the [Life Cycle Security Update Policy](https://access.redhat.com/security/lifecycle-security-update-policy) for information on Red Hat's security update policy as well as information on embargoed (undisclosed) vulnerability handling.

### Resources include the following:

[Red Hat Security Updates (Advisories)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories)

[Red Hat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve)

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.

For more information on CVD, please review the information provided in the following links:

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
CVE-2013-2160: Denial of Service Attacks on Apache CXF
Severity: Critical
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected:
This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 2.5.10, 2.6.7
and 2.7.4.
Description:
It is possible to execute Denial of Service attacks on Apache CXF, exploiting
the fact that the streaming XML parser does not put limits on things like the
number of elements, number of attributes, the nested structure of the document
received, etc. The effects of these attacks can vary from causing high CPU
usage, to causing the JVM to run out of memory.
Apache CXF 2.5.10, 2.6.7 and 2.7.4 onwards pick up Woodstox 4.2.0 as the
streaming XML parser, which enforces appropriate limits to prevent these
attacks.
This has been fixed in revisions:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1460428
Migration:
CXF 2.5.x users should upgrade to 2.5.10 or later as soon as possible.
CXF 2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.7 or later as soon as possible.
CXF 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.4 or later as soon as possible.
Credit: This issue was reported by Andreas Falkenberg of SEC Consult
Deutschland GmbH, and Christian Mainka, Juraj Somorovsky and Joerg Schwenk of
Ruhr-University Bochum.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-29 13:16:20 UTC  ``` Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the way StAX parser implementation of Apache CXF, an open-source web services framework, performed processing of certain XML files. If a web service application utilized the services of the StAX parser, a remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when processed by the application would lead to excessive system resources (CPU cycles, memory) consumption by that application.  References: [1] <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/WSTX-287> [2] <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/WSTX-285>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-27 11:22:23 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2013-2160.txt.asc>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-27 11:30:12 UTC  ``` Upstream patch (picks up Woodstox 4.2.0 as the streaming XML parser):   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1460428>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-27 11:53:14 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the cxf package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17 and 18. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-27 12:11:50 UTC  ``` Regarding the jbossws-cxf packages in Fedora I am not sure if they are affected by this or not (someone more familiar with the jbossws-cxf code please advise).  I will file Fedora child bugs for cxf and jbossws-cxf packages, once jbossws-cxf doubt is cleared.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-27 14:58:22 UTC  ```  Created cxf tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 979086](show_bug.cgi?id=979086 "CLOSED ERRATA - cxf: CVE-2013-2160 cxf, jbossws-cxf, apache-cxf: Multiple denial of service flaws in the StAX parser [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-09 17:37:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0  Via RHSA-2013:1028 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1028.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=929197#c13)  Fedora Update System    2013-08-10 20:01:23 UTC  ``` cxf-2.6.9-1.fc18, jacorb-2.3.1-8.fc18, wss4j-1.6.10-1.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.
