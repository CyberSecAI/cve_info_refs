Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-2244

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way conditional access rules for user fields were handled in Moodle. Specifically, values for user fields used in conditional access rules were not properly escaped before being output to users. This allowed the inclusion of unescaped HTML/JS within these values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. By injecting malicious HTML/JS code into a user field used in a conditional activity, an attacker can have that script executed in the context of other usersâ€™ browsers when they view the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would execute in the browsers of users accessing content with the compromised conditional access rules.
- This could allow the attacker to:
    - Steal user session cookies.
    - Impersonate users.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the Moodle site for affected users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML/JS code into the values of user fields used in conditional activity settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify or create conditional access rules. This would require appropriate permissions within Moodle (e.g., teacher or administrator privileges).
- The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious code into the conditional access rule configuration.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified in Moodle tracker as MDL-37516.
- Affected Moodle versions include 2.5, and versions 2.4 to 2.4.4.
- Patched versions are 2.5.1 and 2.4.5.
- The issue was reported by Jean-Daniel Descoteaux.
- The Moodle git commit messages confirm that the fix involved translating field names on output only and also escaping user field conditions.
