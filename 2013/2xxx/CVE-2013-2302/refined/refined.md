Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from allowing shell access (or similar execution capabilities) to general Unix users on the server hosting Active! mail 6. This is exacerbated by the "external public interface" feature of Active! mail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is the potential for information disclosure.
*   **Insecure Permissions/Access Control:** Granting shell access or command execution rights to general users on the server is a significant security lapse.
*   **External Public Interface Weakness:** Enabling the "external public interface" function introduces a specific attack vector that amplifies the risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Theft:** A malicious user with shell access on the server can potentially steal other user's credentials. This includes potentially sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have the ability to log into the server itself, gaining a shell or similar access. This likely implies a compromised user account.
*   **External Public Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a user having a shell account and the "external public interface" enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Server Access:** The attacker must have some form of login access to the server hosting Active! mail 6.
*   **General User Account:** The attacker does not need administrator privileges, a standard user with shell access is sufficient.
*   **"External public interface" must be enabled.**

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Active! mail 6.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any actions from other legitimate users.
*   The attack is characterized as low to mid complexity
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-200: Information Exposure.
