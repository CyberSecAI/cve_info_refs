##### **Tips**

To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  Synonym expansion for FEP5 search is configured as follows:

  synoynms: a, s1, s2, s3
                      b, s4

  where s1 & s2, s3 are synoynms of a, and s4 is a synoym of b.

  If a search is entered on the storefront: 'a b c', synoynm
  expansion (with a search type of AND) will turn the search term
  into:

  (a AND b AND c) or (s1 AND b AND c) or (s2 and b AND c) or (s3
  AND b AND c) or (a AND s4 AND c) or (s1 AND s4 AND c) or (s2 AND
  s4 AND c) or (s3 AND s4 AND c)

  ```

  PROBLEM ABSTRACT:

  BUSINESS IMPACT:
  performance enhancements

  RECOMMENDATION:

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  Improvements include:

  Facet optimzation:
  1. Query out the facets belong to the category and put them into
  cache to remove the solr query to get the facets.
  2. Put fetching image and sequence for each facet into cache to
  avoid unnecessary request for multi-users that click the same
  category for getting facts.
  3. Fetch the facet fields in srchattr and srchattrprop table
  that belong to the relevant store, not all of the facets.
  4. Remove SolrSearchFacetConditionExpressionProvider from
  IBM_ComposeFacetListByCategoryIdand
  IBM_ComposeProductListByCategory profiles to prevent duplicate
  query for facets.
  5. Remove the getColumnType method for saving db calling in
  SolrExpressionProcessor.

  Entitlement optimization:
  1. Port data cache to cache the generated entitlement
  expression.
  2. To skip solr call when the generated entitlement expression
  is to APPLY_TO_ALL_PRODUCTS

  Payload reduction:
  Do not put empty CatalogGroupView into response noun
