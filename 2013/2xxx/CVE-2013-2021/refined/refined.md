  "CVE-2013-2021": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "CVE",
      "CVERecord": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when calculating the key length in PDF files.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the target system.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a malformed PDF file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the ability to supply the malformed PDF file to a vulnerable ClamAV installation. No special capabilities or network position is required beyond the ability to deliver the crafted PDF file."
    },
        "Additional Information": {
          "Affected Products": "ClamAV, OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Server, openSUSE, Ubuntu",
           "Details": "The vulnerability occurs within `libclamav/pdf.c` during the parsing of PDF documents, specifically within the `check_user_password` function. A logic error allowed a key length to be greater than 128, and the fix includes a length check and a check on the R value, which is the revision number. The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted PDF with a specific structure is scanned, resulting in a buffer overflow. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, if the clamav daemon is running, by sending an email with malicious attachment or scanning a malicous file. "
