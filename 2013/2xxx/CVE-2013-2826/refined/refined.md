The provided content relates to CVE-2013-2826.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper authentication for remote connections to the service. The service authenticates locally through the KAEClientManager console, but not against remote connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The application fails to properly authenticate remote connections. A remote attacker can send a specially crafted packet to port 8130/TCP to disclose credentials. Specifically, this allows acquisition of database login credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can obtain database login credentials for legitimate users.
- This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or further exploitation of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network attack via sending a specially crafted packet to TCP port 8130.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs knowledge of the proprietary protocol used by the application.
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to port 8130/TCP of the target system.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication or access to the local console to exploit the vulnerability.
