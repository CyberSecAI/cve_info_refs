{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect usage of `strncpy` in the network listening part of the iSCSI target driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to unbounded copy with `strncpy`."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative privileges by achieving arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted network traffic to the iSCSI target.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the machine running the vulnerable iSCSI target and send crafted packets. The iSCSI target service must also be running on the target machine. This means firewalls would also have to permit traffic to the iSCSI port."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "Linux kernel iSCSI target subsystem",
    "drivers/target/iscsi/iscsi_target_parameters.c"
  ],
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the `iscsi_add_notunderstood_response` function. The function uses `strncpy` to copy the attacker-provided key into a fixed-size buffer on the heap, but does not prevent copying more than the buffer's capacity. If the key is larger than 64 bytes (as checked by iscsi_check_key), the error response packet will still attempt to copy the entire key, overflowing the heap-allocated structure. The fix is to replace the usage of `strncpy` with `strlcpy`, which will limit the copied data length based on the buffer size."
