Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2884:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the DOM (Document Object Model) implementation of the Chromium web browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Use-after-free: This occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location that has already been freed. This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The use-after-free vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This could lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, or take other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is present within the DOM implementation, suggesting that malicious websites or crafted web content could trigger the vulnerability when rendered by the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would need to be able to deliver malicious web content to the user, likely via a website or a link. The attacker would not require any special privileges on the user's machine other than the ability to execute JavaScript within the browser.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team.
*   The fix was included in Chromium version 28.0.1500.95.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-2732-1 also addresses this vulnerability in chromium-browser package.

This vulnerability is considered a "High" severity issue due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.
