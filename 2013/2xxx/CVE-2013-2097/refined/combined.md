Ok and "joepie91" on reddit posted:

<http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1ee0eg/zpanel_support_team_calls_forum_user_fucken/c9zujzt>

======
It's a pretty basic (and more annoying than harmful) CSRF - basically,
<http://zpanel.whatever.com/?logout=anything> will log out the user from
a panel, no matter where it's called from. There's no logout key, and
no referer checking.

Insert <img src="<http://zpanel.whatever.com/?logout=anything>"> on any
site and anyone that visits the page will have their
zpanel.whatever.com session killed instantly.
======

I can't verify this, but even if true it appears that there is no real
trust boundary violation (user clicks the link, they get logged out,
or JavaScript is used to trigger it, whatever). Unless someone can
show otherwise not assigning a CVE for this issue.

Kurt: just to be clear, joepie91's attack didn't require javascript or
link-clicking or anything of the kind, because it's an img src -- as
long as your browser loads images automatically from non-origin hosts,
it will trigger this behavior.

That said, I agree with Kurt's general assessment here: this kind of DoS
is the nicest possible thing an attacker can do with a CSRF.

# ZPanel - 'templateparser.class.php' Crafted Template Remote Command Execution

#### EDB-ID:

###### 25519

#### CVE:

###### [2013-2097](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-2097)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Sven Slootweg](/?author=5801)

#### Type:

###### [webapps](/?type=webapps)

---

#### Platform:

###### [PHP](/?platform=php)

#### Date:

###### 2013-04-16

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Hi all,

There's an arbitrary (PHP) code execution in ZPanel, a free and
open-source shared hosting control panel. Using the included zsudo
binary, access can be escalated and commands can be run as root.

The vulnerability: ZPanel uses a poor "templater" system that
basically consists of a few str_replace calls and an eval... and as
could be expected from something like this, it does a very poor job at
preventing malicious code. The relevant code can be seen here:
https://github.com/bobsta63/zpanelx/blob/master/dryden/ui/templateparser.class.php
(note the poor attempt at stripping out <?php and ?> tags).

By effectively injecting the replacement that occurs in line 71, one
can run arbitrary PHP code. When combined with ZPanels `zsudo` binary,
one can execute arbitrary commands as root, with a maximum of 5
additional arguments (aside from the path to the
to-be-executed-command).

The scope: Custom templates/themes can be uploaded by resellers and
administrators. This effectively means that anyone that can get access
to a reseller account through any means, including by purchasing a
reseller service from a ZPanel-using host, can gain root access,
without detection.

PoC: Insert the following code anywhere in master.ztml or any other
template that is parsed by the template parser, replacing `touch derp`
with any command of choice:

<& bogus']; exec("/etc/zpanel/panel/bin/zsudo touch /root/derp"); echo
$value['bogus &>

Strangely, login.ztml does not appear to use the templater, and seems
to allow PHP execution by simply using <?php and ?> tags (which I
would consider a vulnerability in itself, but that aside).

Vendor notification: I have warned the ZPanel development team about
their insecure templater *months* ago, and explicitly pointed out that
their "PHP code filtering" was not going to work well. I have
submitted a patch for some other fixable aspects of the templater
(which was merged into the main repository), but the development team
insisted that the security in the templater was fine, and that it
wasn't a problem, basically telling me that they were not going to
change it. They have not fixed this vulnerability, nor do they appear
to have any interest in doing so in the near future.

How to solve it: Either remove the reseller template uploading
functionality (this would impair core functionality), or use a real
templating engine that does not use a few str_replace() calls strung
together in front of an eval().

I'm quite new to this list, and not exactly a pentesting expert, so if
I left out some important information in the above message, please do
let me know.

- Sven Slootweg

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
