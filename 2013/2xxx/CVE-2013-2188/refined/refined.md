Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-2188:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the `do_filp_open()` function in the Linux kernel handles cleanup when write access to a mount is denied.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A file descriptor leak occurs (`filp leak`) when a user attempts to open a file for writing on a read-only filesystem, but write access is denied. The cleanup process in `do_filp_open()` does not properly free the allocated resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local, unprivileged user with access to a read-only mount can exploit this flaw to crash the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker needs access to a read-only mount.
- The attacker attempts to open a file on the read-only filesystem for writing, which will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a local user.
- The attacker needs access to a read-only mounted file system.
- The attacker does not need elevated privileges.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mateusz Guzik of Red Hat.
- Only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is affected by the vulnerability.
- Upstream Linux kernel is not affected.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was addressed in RHSA-2013:0911.
