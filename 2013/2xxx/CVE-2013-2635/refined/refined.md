Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2635:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content is directly related to CVE-2013-2635. It discusses an information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's RTNETLINK component, which is consistent with the CVE description.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**
   - **Root Cause:** An uninitialized structure member within the `rtnl_fill_ifinfo` function in `net/core/rtnetlink.c` leads to an information leak. Specifically, the mac address buffer is not fully initialized. The driver specific function, while filling part of the buffer, will not fill the whole buffer and thus leaving kernel stack memory accessible to userland via the netlink interface.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Kernel stack information leak.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** A local, unprivileged user could read sensitive information from the kernel stack.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Local access. A local user can use a crafted application that utilizes the netlink interface.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system. No special privileges are required to trigger the information leak.

**3. Additional Notes:**
   - The bug is present in Linux kernel versions prior to 3.8.4.
   - Several sources confirm that the vulnerability can be triggered via the `RTM_GETLINK` request for VF devices over the netlink interface.
   - Red Hat has issued multiple security advisories (RHSA-2013:0829, RHSA-2013:1051, RHSA-2013:1080, RHSA-2013:1450) addressing this issue.
   - openSUSE has also released a security update to resolve this issue (openSUSE-SU-2013:1971-1).
   - Ubuntu has issued USN-1809-1, USN-1811-1, USN-1812-1, USN-1813-1, and USN-1814-1 to fix the vulnerability.
   - A patch is available upstream in the Linux kernel git repository `84d73cd3fb142bf1298a8c13fd4ca50fd2432372`
   - The fix involves initializing the MAC address buffer with 0s to prevent the leakage of stack data to userland.

**Summary:**
CVE-2013-2635 details an information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's RTNETLINK component. It occurs due to an uninitialized buffer in the `rtnl_fill_ifinfo` function, allowing local users to read kernel stack memory through the netlink interface.  This could potentially expose sensitive kernel data. The fix involves properly initializing the buffer before sending it to the userland.

**Additional Information present:**
- The content contains details about the fix that are not included in the official CVE description, such as specific function that needs to be patched and the nature of the buffer overflow.
