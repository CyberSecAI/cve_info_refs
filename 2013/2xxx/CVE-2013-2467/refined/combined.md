Alert
# Oracle Releases Updates for Javadoc and Other Java SE Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedOctober 07, 2016
Alert CodeTA13-169A

### Systems Affected

Any system using Oracle Java including

* JDK and JRE 7 Update 21 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 6 Update 45 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 45 and earlier
* JavaFX 2.2.21 and earlier

Website owners that host Javadoc HTML API documentation

### Overview

Oracle released the [June 2013 Critical Patch Update for Oracle Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujun2013-1899847.html). This patch contains 40 new security fixes across Java SE products and a fix to the [Javadoc Tool](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html). API documentation in HTML format generated by the Javadoc tool that contains a right frame may be vulnerable to frame injection when hosted on a web server.

Oracle's June Critical Patch Update includes a fix to the [Javadoc Tool](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html). API documentation in HTML format generated by the Javadoc tool that contains a right frame may be vulnerable to frame injection when hosted on a web server. Additional information can be found in [CERT Vulnerablity Report VU#225657](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/225657). It is recommened that sites hosting such pages should re-generate the API documentation using the latest Javadoc tool and replace the current pages with the re-generated Javadoc output. In cases where regenerating API documentation is not feasible, a Java API Documentation Updater Tool that updates API documentation "in place" is available [Oracle's Java SE Downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

### Impact

An attacker can cause one of the frames within a Javadoc-generated web page to be replaced with a malicious page. This vulnerability could be used for phishing or social engineering, or it could be used for browser exploitation if combined with another browser-related vulnerability.

### Solution

**Apply Updates**

Oracle has released the [June 2013 Java Critical Patch Update](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujun2013-1899847.html) to address this vulnerability. Oracle Java Development Toolkit (JDK) and Javadoc users are advised to apply the [June 2013 Java Critical Patch Update](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujun2013-1899847.html) and regenerate and republish affected Javadoc HTML pages.

**Fix-in-Place Tool**

Oracle has released a fix-in-place tool named [Java API Documentation Updater Tool](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html). This fix-in-place tool can process directories or folders to search for HTML files to be remediated without having to regenerate existing Javadocs. When presented directories/folders and their sub-directories or sub-folders, the [Java API Documentation Updater Tool](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html) will search for files with the following names:

* index.htm
* index.html
* toc.htm
* toc.html

For each file that matches the names noted above, the [Java API Documentation Updater Tool](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html) will search the file for the affected JavaScript text and replace it with the remediated version. Note that this tool will not detect Javadoc pages that have been renamed to something other than one of the above page names.

# Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - June 2013

## Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - June 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update and Security Alert. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update and Security Alert advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 40 new security fixes across Java SE products of which 4 are applicable to server deployments of Java.

### Supported Products Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PatchTable) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Affected product releases and versions:

| Java SE | Patch Availability |
| --- | --- |
| JDK and JRE 7 Update 21 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |

#### Patch Availability Table

| Product Group | Risk Matrix | Patch Availability and Installation Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oracle Java SE | [Oracle JDK and JRE Risk Matrix](#AppendixJAVA) | * Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update June 2013 [My Oracle Support Note 1560542.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1560542.1) * Developers can download the latest release from [http://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html.](/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) * Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com.](//java.com/) Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](//www.java.com/en/download/help/5000020700.xml) to get the latest release. * The latest JavaFX release is included with the latest update of JDK and JRE 7. |

### Risk Matrix Content

The risk matrix lists only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for [previous](/security-alerts/) security fixes can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Document, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply these fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Security advisories, please review [previous](/security-alerts/) advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer supported. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Credit Statement

The following people or organizations reported security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle: Adam Gowdiak of Security Explorations; Ben Murphy via HP's Zero Day Initiative; Hasegawa Yosuke; James Forshaw of Context Information Security; Sam Thomas of Pentest Limited; Tim Brown and Tim Varkalis of Portcullis Computer Security Ltd; and Vitaliy Toropov via HP's Zero Day Initiative.

#### Security-In-Depth Contributors

Oracle provides recognition to people that have contributed to our Security-In-Depth program (see [FAQ](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html)). People are recognized for Security-In-Depth contributions if they provide information, observations or suggestions pertaining to security vulnerability issues that result in significant modification of Oracle code or documentation in future releases, but are not of such a critical nature that they are distributed in Critical Patch Updates.

In this Critical Patch Update Advisory, Oracle recognizes Ben Murphy via HP's Zero Day Initiative; Fermin J Serna of Google; Vladimir Krivopalov of F5 Networks Inc; and Wouter Coekaerts for contributions to Oracle's Security-In-Depth program.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 40 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 37 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/javacpujun2013verbose.html).

This Critical Patch Update includes a fix to the [Javadoc Tool](/java/technologies/javase/javadoc-tool.html). API documentation in HTML format generated by the Javadoc tool that contains a right frame may be vulnerable to frame injection when hosted on a web server. Sites hosting such pages should re-generate the API documentation using the latest Javadoc tool and replace the current pages with the re-generated Javadoc output (see CVE-2013-1571 below). In cases where regenerating API documentation is not feasible, a Java API Documentation Updater Tool that updates API documentation "in place" is available [here](/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 release.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
