Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-2467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Java installer. It's a local privilege escalation issue that can occur during the installation process of a vulnerable version of Java.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** The core weakness is the ability for a local, unprivileged user to gain elevated privileges through a flaw in the Java installer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Compromise:** If exploited successfully, an attacker can gain complete control over the affected system, including full access to sensitive data (confidentiality), the ability to modify system resources (integrity), and disrupt system services (availability).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must already have some form of access to the target system. This is not an attack that can be launched remotely.
*   **Installer Exploit:** The attacker exploits a flaw within the Java installer itself during the installation process

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account (even one with limited privileges) on the target system.
*   **Installation Trigger:** The attacker must be able to trigger the installation process using a vulnerable version of the Java installer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the Java installer for Java 5.0 Update 45 and earlier versions.
*   It does not affect web-based Java execution scenarios such as Java applets or Web Start applications.
*   The CVSS score indicates a high severity (6.9), due to the potential for a complete system compromise
*   The issue is addressed in the June 2013 Java Critical Patch Update.

In summary, CVE-2013-2467 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Java installer. An attacker needs local access and the ability to trigger a vulnerable install process to gain complete control of the machine.
