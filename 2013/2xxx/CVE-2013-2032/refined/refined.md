      "root_cause": "Extensions were not consistently given the opportunity to disable password changes through Special:PasswordReset (using the AbortLogin hook) and Special:ChangePassword (via $wgAuth->authenticate). Some extensions might only implement one method, leading to bypasses.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inconsistent password change blocking methods",
         "Lack of 'AbortChangePassword' hook in Special:ChangePassword"
      ],
      "impact": "A bypass of two-factor authentication if the attacker has access to the victim's email, allowing password reset and subsequent account takeover.  An extension attempting to block password changes using one method might be bypassed by changes made via another method.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Password reset",
        "Direct password change"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Access to the victim's email account (for password reset)",
        "Ability to trigger a password change or reset flow within MediaWiki",
        "Knowledge of the bypass method"
      ],
       "additional_details": "The issue is described in the context of MediaWiki extensions not having a consistent method to prevent password changes. The lack of a unified approach (specifically, the absence of an 'AbortChangePassword' hook in Special:ChangePassword) allowed password changes even when extensions intended to block them. This could bypass two-factor authentication if an attacker also has access to the user's email to initiate a password reset, or if extensions are not consistently handling all forms of password change. A patch was developed to address this weakness by adding the 'AbortChangePassword' hook. This issue was also noted to affect the security by allowing a bypass of the two-factor authentication."
