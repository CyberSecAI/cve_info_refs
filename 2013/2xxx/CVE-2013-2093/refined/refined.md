Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper validation of user input within the `viewimage.php` and `barcode.lib.php` files of Dolibarr ERP/CRM 3.3.1. Specifically, the `barcode_encode_genbarcode` function in `barcode.lib.php` constructs shell commands using user-supplied input without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw.  The application uses `popen` to execute shell commands, and attacker-controlled input is passed as arguments to the shell command. Specifically the `$code` and `$encoding` variables, which are derived from user input, are passed to the `genbarcode` executable without sufficient sanitization. Although `escapeshellarg` is used, the parameters are being passed as separate arguments to the underlying shell command, meaning the shell command can be broken by passing malicious input containing shell metacharacters.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided input before using it in shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Dolibarr application. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server, including the ability to:
    - Steal sensitive data
    - Modify or delete files
    - Install backdoors
    - Launch further attacks on other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted requests to the `viewimage.php` and `barcode.lib.php` scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Dolibarr instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to identify the specific parameters that are used to construct the shell command (likely code and encoding parameters for barcode functionality).
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require prior authentication or authorization, which means an unauthenticated attacker can exploit it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is in Dolibarr ERP/CRM version 3.3.1.
- A fix was introduced in commit `526a80dd202bbca396687a502d52c27e06e97fff`
- The Debian security tracker indicates that a fix is included in version 3.3.4-1 of the dolibarr package.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" by Ubuntu with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8
