Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2876:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper enforcement of restrictions on how extensions can capture screenshots of the browser window, specifically when interstitials are displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Extensions Permissions Confusion:** The core issue is that extensions, with sufficient permissions, can potentially capture screenshots even when they should not. This indicates a flaw in how Chrome manages and isolates extension permissions, particularly in the context of interstitials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is information disclosure. Attackers could leverage this vulnerability to capture screenshots of previously visited web pages by exploiting the fact that extensions may be allowed to capture the screen content even when it is not explicitly intended (such as an interstitial). Sensitive data from those prior visits can be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Extension:** An attacker would need to create or compromise a Chrome extension.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to publish a malicious extension or compromise an existing extension to gain the necessary permissions to capture screenshots.
- The user must have installed the attacker-controlled extension in their browser.

**Additional notes**
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 2724-1) also mentions this vulnerability: *Chrome does not properly enforce restrictions on the capture of screenshots by extensions, which could lead to information disclosure from previous page visits*.
- The vulnerability was credited to Dev Akhawe.
