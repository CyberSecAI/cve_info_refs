ICS Advisory
# Mitsubishi Electric Automation MC-WorX Suite Unsecure ActiveX Control

Last RevisedSeptember 06, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-14-051-02

## OVERVIEW

This advisory is a follow-up to the original alert, titled ICS-ALERT-13-259-01 Mitsubishi MC-WorX Suite Unsecure ActiveX Control,ICS-ALERT-13-259-01 Mitsubishi MC-WorkX Suite Insecure ActiveX Control, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-13-259-01, web site last accessed February 20, 2014. published September 16, 2013, on the NCCIC/ICS‑CERT web site (this was originally incorrectly identified as MC-WorkX, the correct product name is MC-WorX). The original alert was prompted by an uncoordinated public web site release September 15, 2013, by an anonymous researcher.

The anonymous researcher, “Blake,” identified an insecure ActiveX control vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric Automation’s MC-WorX application with proof-of-concept (PoC) code, without coordination with NCCIC/ICS-CERT, the vendor, or any other coordinating entity known to NCCIC/ICS-CERT.

Mitsubishi Electric Automation, Inc has developed a patch for the vulnerable version (8.02). The currently available version of this product is MC-WorX v9.22 released in 2011, which is not vulnerable to this ActiveX vulnerability.

This vulnerability could be exploitable remotely, but requires user interaction. Exploits that target this vulnerability are known to be publicly available.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Mitsubishi Electric Automation, Inc product is affected:

* MC-WorX Suite Version 8.02.

## IMPACT

An attacker crafting a script could assign arbitrary code to the Login Client button. Using social engineering to get the victim to click the Login Client button, arbitrary malicious code could be launched from a remote share.

Mitsubishi Electric Automation, Inc has published a patch resolving this IcoLaunch.dll issue for the vulnerable version of the software.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Mitsubishi Electric Automation, Inc, located in Vernon Hills, Illinois, is the primary location of the MC-WorX software product.

MC-WorX Suite Version 8.02 is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water and Wastewater Systems in the United States.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

The insecure ActiveX control is located in the IcoLaunch.dll file. An attacker can fashion a script to launch any arbitrary executable code when the Login Client button is clicked, without any authentication or permission elevation. Social engineering would be needed to get the user to click the altered Login Client button to launch the loaded executable.

NCCIC/ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC/ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) NCCIC/ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B—Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC/ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

In addition, NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

1. Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
