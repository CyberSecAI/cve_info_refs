Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-2921:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue that occurs within the resource loader of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Use-after-free:** The core issue is that a resource is accessed after it has been freed from memory. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The provided text does not specify the direct impact of exploitation but a use-after-free vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary code.
    *   Cause a denial of service (crash).
    *   Leak sensitive information (though not explicitly mentioned here).
    *   Possibly gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted web page, or potentially any other content that uses the resource loading mechanism. The specific way to trigger the use-after-free is not detailed, but the issue lies within how Chromium's resource loader manages resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would need to be able to serve or get a user to load the malicious content with a crafted request that triggers the use-after-free in Chromium's resource loader. This could be through:
    *   Hosting a malicious web page.
    *   Injecting malicious content into a legitimate website.
    *   Email or other means that deliver HTML content.
    *   Man-in-the-middle attack on network traffic

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in Chromium versions prior to 30.0.1599.66.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Byoungyoung Lee and Tielei Wang of Georgia Tech Information Security Center (GTISC).
* The fix was included in Chromium 30.0.1599.66 and later versions.
* The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 2785-1) also mentions the fix for Debian users and their versions.
