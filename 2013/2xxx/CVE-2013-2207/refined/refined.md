{
  "CVE-2013-2207": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "The setuid installed pt_chown helper binary had a weak check on whether a file descriptor was a tty. This allowed an attacker to bypass the check using a FUSE filesystem.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Weak tty check",
        "Setuid binary"
      ],
      "Impact": "A local attacker could gain unauthorized read/write access to a victim's pseudoterminal.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "Local exploit",
        "FUSE filesystem to fake a pty"
      ],
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user account and a kernel with FUSE support and \"user_allow_other\" set in fuse.conf"
    },
    "additional_information": {
          "glibc_fix": "The fix is to disable building and installing pt_chown by default.  A configure option to enable building pt_chown was added for distributions that require this functionality. Note that distributions are discouraged from installing pt_chown due to security risk.",
           "devpts_note": "pt_chown is not needed in most modern distributions since devpts is enabled by default.",
          "affected_versions": "glibc versions prior to 2.18"
        }
