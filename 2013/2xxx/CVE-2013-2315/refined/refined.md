Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the password reminder functionality of EC-CUBE. Specifically, the application was using `LIKE` operators instead of `=` for comparing user inputs (email, name01, name02) in SQL queries, leading to a potential for information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application uses `LIKE` instead of `=` in SQL queries within the password reset function, allowing for broader matching than intended.
- **SQL Injection (Potential):** While not explicitly stated as SQL injection, the use of `LIKE` with user-controlled input makes it potentially vulnerable to SQL injection or information disclosure by crafting input that matches multiple user records.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially obtain customer information by exploiting the loose input validation. They might be able to gain access to customer details by providing partial or wildcard-like values for the parameters. The severity is considered "High" because it can be exploited over the internet and with no authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP requests to the password reminder function.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable EC-CUBE application.
- **No Prior Knowledge Required**: No account or prior interaction with the application is needed.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `LC_Page_Forgot.php` file within the password reset functionality.
- Specifically, the following SQL query lines were modified:

    ```
    // Before:
    $where = '(email Like ? OR email_mobile Like ?) AND name01 Like ? AND name02 Like ? AND del_flg = 0';

    // After:
    $where = '(email = ? OR email_mobile = ?) AND name01 = ? AND name02 = ? AND del_flg = 0';

    // Before:
    $where = '(email Like ? OR email_mobile Like ?)'
            . ' AND name01 Like ? AND name02 Like ?'

    // After:
    $where = '(email = ? OR email_mobile = ?)'
            . ' AND name01 = ? AND name02 = ?'
    ```

- The fix involves replacing `LIKE` operators with `=` operators to enforce exact matching for the provided user inputs.

**Affected Versions:**

- EC-CUBE versions 2.11.0 through 2.12.3, including variations such as 2.12.3en, 2.12.3enP1, and 2.12.3enP2
