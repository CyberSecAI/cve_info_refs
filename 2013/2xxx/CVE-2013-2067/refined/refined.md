Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2067:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content directly references "CVE-2013-2067" and provides details on the fix for this vulnerability in Apache Tomcat's `FormAuthenticator`. 
*   The included changelog messages, commit logs and Red Hat Security Advisory confirm that the described issue is directly related to CVE-2013-2067.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Tomcat's `FormAuthenticator` handles session IDs when configured to change session IDs upon successful authentication. The change was done *after* displaying the login form, creating a vulnerable window.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Session fixation. The session change was delayed, leaving a window where an attacker could inject an authentication request with a known session ID. 
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack could allow an attacker to inject a request that would be executed with a legitimate user's credentials. This enables session hijacking by an attacker using a known session id or by extracting the session id from log files.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A remote attacker sends requests while a user is logging in using the FormAuthenticator.
    *   The attacker exploits the delay in the session ID change and injects a request with a known jsessionid that will be associated with the user's session upon successful authentication.
    *  The attacker may extract the session ID from log files.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Remote attacker.
    *   No authentication needed initially. The attack relies on the attacker having a valid session id.
    *   Ability to send requests to the vulnerable application while a legitimate user is in the process of logging in.
    *   Ability to monitor/capture network traffic or have access to logs to extract a valid session id.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Tomcat versions 6.0.21 and later (where the `changeSessionIdOnAuthentication` was implemented) and 7.0.x.
*   The fix involves changing the session ID before displaying the login form.
*   The Red Hat advisory (RHSA-2013:0839) lists CVE-2013-2067 alongside other vulnerabilities fixed in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0.
*   The fix requires changes in FormAuthenticator.java and changelog.xml, as shown in the diff.
*   The `changeSessionIdOnAuthentication` is not enabled by default on Tomcat 6.x.

In summary, CVE-2013-2067 is a session fixation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat's FormAuthenticator that, under specific circumstances, allows a remote attacker to hijack user sessions. The fix implemented involves changing the session ID before displaying the login form to close the vulnerable window where the attack is possible.
