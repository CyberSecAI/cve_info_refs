# WordPress 3.5.2 Maintenance and Security Release

---

WordPress 3.5.2 is now available. This is the second maintenance release of 3.5, fixing [12 bugs](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=3.5.2). **This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.** The WordPress security team resolved seven security issues, and this release also contains some additional security hardening.

The security fixes included:

* Blocking server-side request forgery attacks, which could potentially enable an attacker to gain access to a site.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=976784#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-21 12:54:50 UTC  ``` On Friday, 2013-06-21 WordPress upstream is about to release new WordPress v3.5.2 version, correcting the following security flaws:  * [CVE-2013-2199](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2199) - SSRF, multiple vulnerabilities:    Inadequate SSRF protection for HTTP requests where the user can provide a URL   can allow for attacks against the intranet and other sites. This is a   continuation of work related to [CVE-2013-0235](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0235), which was specific to SSRF in   pingback requests and was fixed in 3.5.1.  * [CVE-2013-2200](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2200) - Privilege escalation allowing contributors to publish posts:    Inadequate checking of a user's capabilities could allow them to publish posts   when their user role should not allow for it; and to assign posts to other   authors.  * [CVE-2013-2201](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2201) - XSS, multiple vulnerabilities:    Inadequate escaping allowed an administrator to trigger a cross-site scripting   vulnerability through the uploading of media files and plugins.  * [CVE-2013-2202](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2202) - XXE via oEmbed:    The processing of an oEmbed response is vulnerable to an XXE.  * [CVE-2013-2203](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2203) - Full Path Disclosure during File Upload:    If the uploads directory is not writable, error message data returned via XHR   will include a full path to the directory.  And two security flaws in external products:  * [CVE-2013-2204](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2204) - Content Spoofing in the MoxieCode (TinyMCE) MoxiePlayer project:   Upstream patch: <https://github.com/moxiecode/moxieplayer/commit/b61ac518ffa2657e2dc9019b2>  * [CVE-2013-2205](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2205) - Cross-domain XSS in SWFUpload (again):   Fix: Removing security.allowDomain("*") and only allow access from the same domain.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=976784#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-06-22 16:36:48 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5.2>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=976784#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-06-22 16:38:57 UTC  ``` Created wordpress tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 977018](show_bug.cgi?id=977018 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2199 CVE-2013-2200 CVE-2013-2201 CVE-2013-2202 CVE-2013-2203 CVE-2013-2204 CVE-2013-2205 wordpress: Multiple security flaws to be corrected within upstream 3.5.2 version [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 977019](show_bug.cgi?id=977019 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2199 CVE-2013-2200 CVE-2013-2201 CVE-2013-2202 CVE-2013-2203 CVE-2013-2204 CVE-2013-2205 wordpress: Multiple security flaws to be corrected within upstream 3.5.2 version [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=976784#c3)  Fedora Update System    2013-07-03 01:35:46 UTC  ``` wordpress-3.5.2-1.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

Debian Bug     : 713947

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead of
backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

# Announcing a secure SWFUpload fork

The WordPress security team has officially forked the [long-abandoned SWFUpload project](https://code.google.com/p/swfupload/) and is strongly encouraging all web developers who use SWFUpload to update.

**We strongly suggest you do not use SWFUpload. But if you must, use this fork.** You can find it on GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the ‘pull request’ where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner. <https://github.com/> at [github.com/wordpress/secure-swfupload](http://github.com/wordpress/secure-swfupload).

WordPress does *not* use SWFUpload, but we continue to include it in WordPress coreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress. for plugins that have yet to be updated to use [Plupload](http://plupload.com/), our upload library of choice. Plupload is written and actively maintained by [Moxiecode](http://www.moxiecode.com/), the developers of [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/).

We do not condone the use of abandonware. We only wish to make the web a better place by ensuring that developers have access to a secure version of SWFUpload, when the only alternative may be to use insecure code.

This is a fork of SWFUpload 2.2.0.1 and includes cross-site scripting fixes that have been reported by Szymon Gruszecki (CVE-2013-2205 and CVE-2012-2399), and Neal Poole and Nathan Partlan (CVE-2012-3414). It also includes fixes from Yelp’s engineering team for CVE-2012-2399.

**WordPress 3.5.2**, [released moments ago](https://wordpress.org/news/2013/06/wordpress-3-5-2/), includes fixes for CVE-2013-2205 and CVE-2012-2399. WordPress 3.3.2 (2012-04-20) included a fix for CVE-2012-3414 and an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-2399.

**If you think you have found a vulnerability in this fork of SWFUpload, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.** Please email reports of security vulnerabilities to swfupload-security AT wordpress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users. This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization. <https://wordpress.org/>. These reports will be reviewed by the WordPress security team and by security researchers contributing to this project, including Neal and Szymon.

# WordPress 3.5.2 Maintenance and Security Release

---

WordPress 3.5.2 is now available. This is the second maintenance release of 3.5, fixing [12 bugs](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=3.5.2). **This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.** The WordPress security team resolved seven security issues, and this release also contains some additional security hardening.

The security fixes included:

* Blocking server-side request forgery attacks, which could potentially enable an attacker to gain access to a site.
* Disallow contributors from improperly publishing posts, reported by [Konstantin Kovshenin](http://kovshenin.com/), or reassigning the post’s authorship, reported by [Luke Bryan](http://www.sharefaith.com/).
* An update to the SWFUpload external library to fix cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Reported by [mala](http://ma.la) and [Szymon Gruszecki](http://mars.iti.pk.edu.pl/~grucha/). (Developers: More on SWFUpload [here](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/06/21/secure-swfupload/).)
* Prevention of a denial of service attack, affecting sites using password-protected posts.
* An update to an external TinyMCE library to fix a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Reported by [Wan Ikram](http://twitter.com/rinakikun).
* Multiple fixes for cross-site scripting. Reported by [Andrea Santese](http://webapplicationsecurity.altervista.org/) and Rodrigo.
* Avoid disclosing a full file path when a upload fails. Reported by [Jakub Galczyk](http://hauntit.blogspot.de/).

We appreciated [responsible disclosure](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security) of these issues directly to our security team. For more information on the changes, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5.2) or consult [the list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.5?rev=24498&stop_rev=23347).

[Download WordPress 3.5.2](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.5.2.zip) or update now from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site’s admin area.

*Also:* **WordPress 3.6 Beta 4:** If you are testing WordPress 3.6, please note that [WordPress 3.6 Beta 4](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.6-beta4.zip) (zip) includes fixes for these security issues.
