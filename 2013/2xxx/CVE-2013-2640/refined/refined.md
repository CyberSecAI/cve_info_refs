Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2640:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from an insecure method of checking if a user was logged in within the `wp-mailup` WordPress plugin. The plugin was relying on checking for the presence of a cookie named "wordpress_logged_in" to determine user authentication. This is unreliable because cookies can be manipulated by the client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Authentication:** The plugin used client-side cookie data to verify user login status instead of using a server-side method. This allowed an attacker to potentially bypass authentication by crafting or manipulating cookies, effectively impersonating a logged-in user.
*   **Lack of Proper Input Sanitization:** Although not explicitly mentioned as the root cause, the provided changeset shows that the plugin was later updated to use `stripslashes()` function which indicates a potential issue with data sanitization from user input in the ajax calls. This may be related to an additional vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially bypass the plugin's authentication mechanism and access administrative or other privileged features that should only be available to logged-in users. Specifically, based on the code diff, the attacker could potentially:
    - Modify plugin settings through AJAX calls that require an authenticated user. This is evident by the access control check on `$_REQUEST['formData'] == 'save'` and `$_REQUEST['formData'] == 'load'`.
    - Potentially load malicious configurations through the `wpmailup_load_config` function.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cookie Manipulation:** An attacker could forge or alter the "wordpress\_logged\_in" cookie to trick the plugin into thinking they are a logged-in user. This could be done through client-side manipulation or other methods of intercepting or modifying HTTP requests.
*   **Direct AJAX call:** An attacker could send malicious AJAX calls to the plugin, as the authentication bypass allowed access to the function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the WordPress site and manipulate the cookie values.
*   No specific user-level access is needed, only the ability to send requests.
*   The attacker does not need to be a user on the target website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided changeset indicates that the vulnerability was patched by replacing the cookie-based check with the `is_user_logged_in()` function.
*   The reference to `http://wpsecure.net/2013/03/mailup-plugin-ajax/` indicates that this vulnerability was publicly disclosed, and the patch was a direct response to that report.
*   The changelog also shows the introduction of `stripslashes()` on multiple input fields, which may imply other vulnerability vectors related to unescaped input data.
*   The plugin was ultimately closed by the author, and is no longer available for download.

**Summary**

The vulnerability in the `wp-mailup` plugin allowed an unauthenticated attacker to bypass the plugin's login check by manipulating cookies. This could result in unauthorized access to plugin settings and potentially other sensitive functionality. The vulnerability was addressed by utilizing the WordPress built in `is_user_logged_in()` function.
