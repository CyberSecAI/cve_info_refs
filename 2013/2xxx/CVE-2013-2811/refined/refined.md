The provided content relates to CVE-2013-2811.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Catapult Software DNP3 driver, used in GE's iFIX and CIMPLICITY products, does not properly validate input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The driver fails to validate input correctly, leading to a potential infinite loop and process crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful attack results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, crashing the HMI. The system must be manually shut down and restarted to recover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **IP-Based Network:** A specially crafted TCP packet sent from an outstation can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Serial Connection:** Physical access to the outstation allows the same attack via the serial connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **IP-Based:** The attacker must be able to send a specially crafted TCP packet to the affected system over the network.
- **Serial:** The attacker needs physical access to the outstation to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both IP-connected and serial-connected devices, resulting in two different CVSS scores.
- The vulnerability is considered remotely exploitable over IP.
- No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability, but it is considered moderately difficult to exploit.
- The affected software includes Catapult Software DNP driver versions 7.20.56 and prior, as well as GE Proficy HMI/SCADA iFIX or CIMPLICITY servers with the vulnerable driver installed.
- Mitigation includes updating the DNP driver to version 7.20.60 or newer.
