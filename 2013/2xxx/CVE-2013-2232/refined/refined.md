  "CVE-2013-2232": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "MULTIPLE",
      "Published": "2013-07-02",
      "Modified": "2021-02-17"
    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Description": "The ip6_sk_dst_check function in net/ipv6/ip6_output.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by using an AF_INET6 socket for a connection to an IPv4 interface.",
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect assumption within the `ip6_sk_dst_check` function. It assumes that a socket's dst cache will always point to an `rt6_info` structure, which is only valid for IPv6 destinations. However, when an AF_INET6 socket connects to an IPv4 address, the dst cache holds an `rtable` structure, which is intended for IPv4 routing, leading to a type mismatch.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect type assumption",
        "Type mismatch when using IPv6 socket for IPv4 destination"
      ],
      "Impact": "A local user can cause a denial of service by triggering a system crash.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Local user",
        "Using AF_INET6 socket",
        "Connecting to IPv4 interface"
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": [
        "Local user",
        "Ability to use system calls like `sendmsg()` to send messages using an IPv6 socket."
        , "No special privileges are needed."
      ],
	  "Additional Details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a local, unprivileged user using a crafted application. Systems without IPv6 support are not affected. The `ip6_sk_dst_check()` function fails to validate that the socket destination is IPv6 before dereferencing it as an `rt6_info` structure. When an IPv6 socket is used to communicate to an IPv4 address, the socket dst cache pointer will point to a IPv4 rtable entry, causing a crash due to invalid dereferencing of a type different from that expected, leading to potential system crashes and denial of service."
