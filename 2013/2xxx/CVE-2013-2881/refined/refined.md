Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-2881

**Vulnerability:** Same Origin Policy bypass in frame handling.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a result of an issue in how Chromium handles frames, allowing for a bypass of the Same Origin Policy.

**Weaknesses:** The Same Origin Policy, which is a core security mechanism in web browsers, is not being correctly enforced in frame handling. This allows for a potential violation of security boundaries between different origins.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access sensitive information from other origins, which could lead to data breaches and other malicious activities. 

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector would likely involve a crafted web page that manipulates frame handling in a way that bypasses the Same Origin Policy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to host a malicious webpage, and the victim would need to visit that page using a vulnerable version of the Chromium browser.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Karthik Bhargavan and was assigned a medium severity.
- This vulnerability was addressed in Chromium version 28.0.1500.95.
