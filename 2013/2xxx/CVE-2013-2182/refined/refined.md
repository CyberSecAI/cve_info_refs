Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Mandril security plugin within the Monkey HTTPD server. The plugin's URI validation process incorrectly handles encoded URIs. It checks configuration rules against the original, encoded URI, but fails to check the decoded version. This allows for a bypass of configured access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate URI Validation:** The core issue is the insufficient validation of request URIs within the Mandril plugin. It only checks the encoded URI string and ignores its decoded version.
- **Bypass of Access Control:** Due to the faulty URI validation, attackers can bypass configured rules that are intended to restrict access to certain directories or resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to protected areas of the web server that are supposed to be restricted.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** This bypass could potentially be a stepping stone to further attacks depending on the nature of the protected content and resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests that contain encoded URIs.
- **URI Encoding:** Specifically, using a double encoding of the forward slash `/` character as `%2f` or `//`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Monkey HTTPD server.
- **Knowledge of Protected Resources:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the resources that are protected by Mandril rules, or attempt to discover protected locations.

**Technical Details:**

- **PoC:**
  - **Configuration:** A rule is set to `Deny_URL /test/`.
  - **Vulnerable Request:** A request to `http://yourhost/%2ftest/` or `http://yourhost//test/` bypasses this rule because the plugin fails to decode the URI before performing the check.
- **Code Change:** The fix involved checking the decoded version of the URI ( `sr->uri_processed` ) in addition to the original encoded URI ( `sr->uri` ) within the `mk_security_check_url` function.
