### Summary of CVE-2013-2099

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `ssl.match_hostname()` function in Python's SSL module was vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to its inefficient handling of certificates containing excessive wildcard characters (`*`) in the hostname. Specifically, the function used regular expressions to match hostnames against certificate names, and the use of many wildcards caused the regex matching to become computationally expensive, leading to high CPU usage and a potential denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inefficient Wildcard Matching:** The `_dnsname_to_pat` function used regular expressions that scaled poorly with the number of wildcard characters in the hostname pattern, leading to performance issues.
- **Lack of Wildcard Limit:** There was no limit on the number of wildcard characters allowed in a certificate's hostname, making it possible for attackers to craft certificates that could trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by presenting a specially crafted certificate with multiple wildcards. The `ssl.match_hostname()` function would consume excessive CPU resources trying to validate the certificate, causing a denial of service for the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Certificate Manipulation:** The attacker needs to have control over the certificate presented during an SSL/TLS handshake. This typically implies the attacker must either compromise a Certificate Authority (CA) or be in a position to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack and present a crafted certificate.
- **Hostname Validation:** The attack is triggered when the `ssl.match_hostname()` function is used to validate a hostname against a certificate with excessive wildcards. This could occur in both client and server applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Obtain a Valid Certificate:** An attacker would need a certificate, likely signed by a compromised or attacker controlled CA, that included a large number of wildcard characters in the subject's common name.
- **MITM or Compromised CA:** Attackers need to be in a position to intercept or manipulate the SSL/TLS handshake by either being a Man-in-the-Middle or by having access to a compromised Certificate Authority.
- **Target Application using `ssl.match_hostname()`:**  Attackers need an application to be using vulnerable version of `ssl.match_hostname()` function which performs hostname verification.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability stems from how `_dnsname_to_pat` function generated a regex from the DNS name which was used by the `match_hostname` function.
- A patch was implemented that limits the number of wildcards allowed per domain fragment to a maximum of 1, preventing the exponential complexity.

**Affected Versions:**
- Python versions 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 were directly affected, and other packages bundling the affected code (such as `python-backports-ssl_match_hostname`, python-pip, etc) were also affected.

**Resolution:**

- The fix limits the number of wildcards allowed in the certificate name, specifically one per fragment of the domain name, resolving the DoS issue.
- Patches were backported to older versions such as python 2.7, python3.2.
