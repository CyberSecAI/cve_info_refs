# USN-1985-1: Python 3.3 vulnerabilities

1 October 2013

Several security issues were fixed in Python.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [python3.3](/security/cves?package=python3.3) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

Florian Weimer discovered that Python incorrectly handled matching multiple

wildcards in ssl certificate hostnames. An attacker could exploit this to

cause Python to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2013-2099](/security/CVE-2013-2099))

Ryan Sleevi discovered that Python did not properly handle certificates

with NULL characters in the Subject Alternative Name field. An attacker

could exploit this to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive

information or alter encrypted communications. ([CVE-2013-4238](/security/CVE-2013-4238))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963260#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-15 14:02:27 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way SSL module implementation of Python3, version 3 of the Python programming language (aka Python 3000), performed matching of the certificate's name in the case it contained many '*' wildcard characters. A remote attacker, able to obtain valid certificate with its name containing a lot of '*' wildcard characters could use this flaw to cause denial of service (excessive CPU consumption) by issuing request to validate such a certificate for / to an application using the Python's ssl.match_hostname() functionality.  Upstream bug report: [1] <http://bugs.python.org/issue17980>  CVE request: [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/05/15/6> (is for python-backports-ssl_match_hostname, but that code comes from Python 3.2 ssl module implementation) [3] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/05/15/7>  Acknowledgements:  Name: Florian Weimer (Red Hat Product Security)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=963260#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-15 14:03:50 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the python3 package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17 and 18.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-12-11 10:55:31 UTC  ``` Alex Gaynor reports:  """ When Python's standard library HTTP clients (httplib, urllib, urllib2, xmlrpclib) are used to access resources with HTTPS, by default the certificate is not checked against any trust store, nor is the hostname in the certificate checked against the requested host. It was possible to configure a trust root to be checked against, however there were no faculties for hostname checking.

This change affects urllib, urllib2, http, and httplib modules, and other modules that use one of the mentioned modules (e.g. xmlrpclib).  Upstream bugs linked by PEP 476:  <http://bugs.python.org/issue22366> <http://bugs.python.org/issue22417>  This change depends on another PEP 466 "Network Security Enhancements for Python 2.7.x":  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/>  The PEP 466 covers a set of not directly related enhancement, one of them being update of the ssl module.  The update adds few features relevant here - SSLContext support, which defines connections parameters and verification done during handshake, name checking functions (previously packages for python 2.7 via a separate python-backports-ssl_match_hostname package), and functionality for loading system trust store.  Upstream bug for the ssl module part of PEP 466:  <http://bugs.python.org/issue21308>  Following LWN article provides good overview of the changes and motivations:  <https://lwn.net/Articles/611243/>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c8)  Nick Coghlan    2015-05-04 05:12:27 UTC  ``` The key concern here is how to handle operating environments where defaulting to validation of HTTPS certificates is currently infeasible. Upstream we opted for the relatively straightforward solution of a hard break in 2.7.9 and 3.4.3, with a sitecustomize based solution for reverting to the old behaviour in a given environment: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0476/#opting-out>  Further discussion of the backport in the Linux distribution case showed that that approach wasn't going to be sufficient for redistributors that offer strong stability guarantees for controlled environments: we need a way to opt-out by default that doesn't rely on sitecustomize in order to provide an "opt-in" transition period that decouples the Python upgrade decision from the activation of default HTTPS certification verification in Python based scripts and applications.   The relevant upstream bug seeking a standardised approach to this is at <https://bugs.python.org/issue23857>  The two main candidates are:  * introduce a Python SSL configuration file under /etc that is read by the SSL module at import time. The default behaviour in the absence of that file would be to verify HTTPS certifications. If the file was present, there would be three options: verification forced off, verification forced on, and setting delegated to the platform vendor.  * use an environment variable with the same settings as suggested for the configuration file. The main problem with this is that the -E switch will ignore any environment variable based solution, so passing -E would also have the effect of opting back in to verifying HTTPS certificates by default.  While the latter approach was previously used for the Python hash randomisation change, the interaction with -E is likely to be far more problematic in this case.  So my recommendation is to proceed with the configuration file based approach, and write an upstream Python Enhancement Proposal seeking standardisation of the name, file format and behaviour for redistributors that opt-in to providing this behaviour. This would be similar to the existing PEP providing recommendations for management of the Python symlink: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c14)  Nick Coghlan    2015-05-10 05:37:30 UTC  ``` First draft of an upstream recommendations PEP: <https://hg.python.org/peps/rev/85bc7f13b295>  I listed Robert as a co-author, since the suggested design is actually his, I just added all the surrounding rationale.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c15)  Nick Coghlan    2015-05-12 03:46:32 UTC  ``` I referenced the draft PEP from an ongoing python-dev discussion (primarily with Marc-Andre Lemburg of eGenix): <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2015-May/139922.html>  The key technical point raised in that discussion so far is that any patch we apply should be "virtualenv aware", as it may be desirable to be able to have the certificate verification default behaviour be different in virtual environments.  We can detect that easily enough by looking for "sys.real_prefix": <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1871549/python-determine-if-running-inside-virtualenv>  My initial inclination is to just not read the global config file when running inside a virtual environment, and hence always apply the upstream default of verifying HTTPS certificates.  The alternative would be to always read the configuration file, but have separate global settings for running in the system Python directly vs running in virtual environments.  The latter approach does have the virtue of offering a phased migration path that looks like:  * initial default matches upstream 2.7.5 (no HTTPS certificate verification) * virtualenv default setting is updated to enable verification * system Python default setting updated to enable verification  Configuration of the setting within a *specific* virtual environment would be out of scope for this BZ, but rather a discussion to be had with the upstream virtualenv project: <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c16)  Tomas Hoger    2015-05-12 05:50:41 UTC  ``` Pre-formatted version of the PEP 493 proposal (source is linked from [comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c14)):  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0493/>  Link to python-dev discussion thread as archived on gmane.

It sounds like this would lead to the same problems we're trying to address with the global opt-in / opt-out switch - it forces the change of behaviour inside virtualenvs with no easy way to revert it.  AFAICS, virtualenv uses system stdlib and does not make a separate copy of it in ENV.  If this should be extra virtualenv friendly, ssl can look for the config file in ENV/etc before using /etc file.  However, this does not seem very important and may even be confusing (e.g. why should verification configuration be per virtualenv when there's no support for per virtualenv CA bundle?).  What's the argument for treating virtualenv as special?   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c18)  Robert Kuska    2015-05-12 07:46:48 UTC  ``` This could be one argument.  Lets say we have system with following settings in the config file:  [https] verify=enable virtualenv_verify=disable  Now those of users who aren't administrators may create their virtualenv in which the python will not verify certificates by default.  Or we could just simply support users config files in ~/.python/cert-verification.conf?   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2015-05-12 08:49:04 UTC  ``` The proposed patch we currently have can be extended in many ways - it can be made virtualenv aware, it can support per-user configuration, it can provide per-site configuration capabilities.  The original vision here was to give administrators an easy way to set what should be the global default.  It was not meant to provide per-application or per-invocation setting.  Global or user-specific config does not provide sufficient granularity.  Anyone building virtualenv only to disable verification for a specific application can use out-out mechanisms documented in PEP 476.  If we find it important to provide per-application or per-invocation setting that does not require any patching, I'd consider exploring mechanisms that are better suited for that - it seems other vendors shipping python are already looking at using PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY environment variable.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c20)  Nick Coghlan    2015-05-12 14:26:47 UTC  ``` Right, after a couple of iterations of the discussion with MAL on python-dev, I finally understood what problem he was trying to solve, and how it differed from our problem as a platform provider.  As a result, I pushed an update which describes both approaches (a config file and an environment variable), and the contexts where they may be appropriate: <https://hg.python.org/peps/rev/b395246d0af7>  For our use case of providing this as an opt-in feature on a per-system basis atop 2.7.5, I think the config file recommendation is good way to go. Relative to Robert's draft patch, the changes in the current PEP draft are:  * Using .cfg as the filename extension (based on pyvenv.cfg as the venv config extension in Python 3) * Adding "verify_in_virtualenv" as an optional override for the main "verify" setting if different behaviour is wanted in virtual environments  At the system Python level, I don't think supporting the environment variable *as well* is worth the extra complexity it introduces, especially given the availability of other tools like containers.  However, I'm not sure that's the right answer for the Python 2.7 software collection, though. The software collection potentially seems closer to MAL's PyRun use case, where the environment variable based solution might be a better fit.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2015-05-14 07:44:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to Nick Coghlan from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c20)) > Relative to Robert's draft patch, the changes in the current PEP draft are:  * When config file can not be read, or does not contain [https] section or verify option, or verify option value is unknown, PEP 493 defaults to enabled verification rather than platform default.  This may not be obvious from the patch that went into the upstream bug as platform default there is enable, hence these error paths also use enable.  I don't view fallback to platform default as completely unreasonable, at least when config file can be opened and does not contain [https] section (e.g. it's all commented out).  Cases when config can not be opened or verify has invalid value are more problematic.  > * Adding "verify_in_virtualenv" as an optional override for the main > "verify" setting if different behaviour is wanted in virtual environments  I do not find much explanation why this is worth it.  I believe it's coming from here:  <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2015-May/139932.html>  * Most applications use some kind of virtualenv   Python environment to run the code. These are   typically isolated from the system Python installation   and so wouldn't want to use a system wide global INI   neither.  As noted above, virtualenvs use system Python stdlib including ssl module, which is going to use system CA bundle.  So it seems unexpected that there's special handling only for the system config file.  > At the system Python level, I don't think supporting the environment > variable *as well* is worth the extra complexity it introduces,  The environment variable seems less interesting while defaulting to disabled verification (i.e. as opt-in mechanism), but is more useful when default is enabled and it can be used to easily opt-out in specific cases.  PEP 493 suggests both mechanisms can be implemented by distributors, but does not suggest how to combine them.  I do not believe combined approach is actually complex and this is how it should be done:  def _get_https_context_factory():     # check environment variable first     config_setting = os.environ.get('PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY')     if config_setting is not None:         if config_setting == '0':             return _create_unverified_context         return create_default_context      # use configured or platform default if not overridden by environment     config_file = '/etc/python/cert-verification.conf'     context_factories = {     ....  > especially given the availability of other tools like containers.  This is why I view verify_in_virtualenv as not really necessary.  virtualenv is container for python application and hence container specific overrides (sitecustomize or PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY if supported) seem more appropriate than global setting affecting all containers.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c22)  Nick Coghlan    2015-05-18 01:46:43 UTC  ``` OK, I like the idea of dropping the global virtualenv setting in favour of documenting how to combine the configuration file with the environment variable. I'll update the PEP accordingly.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c23)  Nick Coghlan    2015-05-19 13:32:47 UTC  ``` Update pushed at <https://hg.python.org/peps/rev/b5e0791f27bf>  Notable changes:  * PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY is now presented first * Separate verify_in_virtualenv setting is gone * New section covers combining the two recommendations * Comments about the attack surface area have been removed * The platform default setting is now used whenever the setting can't be accessed (I originally wrote the example implementation assuming 2.7.9 as the basis for the default behaviour, rather than 2.7.5. I missed a couple of logic branches in the commit linked above, fixed here: <https://hg.python.org/peps/rev/19c17ec83bcd>)  Minor fixes:  * example code now uses the ".cfg" extension * the unused "section" variable has been removed from the example code * the default factory is now always read from the mapping rather than being separately hard coded in the final mapping lookup   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1173041#c24)  Tomas Hoger    2015-06-04 08:00:12 UTC  ``` Thank you, the above changes look good to me.

## Topic

An updated python-backports-ssl\_match\_hostname package that fixes one
security issue is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
Platform 4.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the

## Description

The python-backports-ssl\_match\_hostname package provides RFC 6125 compliant
wildcard matching.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Python's SSL module
implementation performed matching of certain certificate names. A remote
attacker able to obtain a valid certificate that contained multiple
wildcard characters could use this flaw to issue a request to validate such
a certificate, resulting in excessive consumption of CPU. (CVE-2013-2099)

This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

All python-backports-ssl\_match\_hostname users are advised to upgrade to
this updated package, which contains a backported patch to correct this
issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963260#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-15 14:02:27 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way SSL module implementation of Python3, version 3 of the Python programming language (aka Python 3000), performed matching of the certificate's name in the case it contained many '*' wildcard characters. A remote attacker, able to obtain valid certificate with its name containing a lot of '*' wildcard characters could use this flaw to cause denial of service (excessive CPU consumption) by issuing request to validate such a certificate for / to an application using the Python's ssl.match_hostname() functionality.  Upstream bug report: [1] <http://bugs.python.org/issue17980>  CVE request: [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/05/15/6> (is for python-backports-ssl_match_hostname, but that code comes from Python 3.2 ssl module implementation) [3] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/05/15/7>  Acknowledgements:  Name: Florian Weimer (Red Hat Product Security)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=963260#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-15 14:03:50 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the python3 package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17 and 18.

| ``` If the name in the certificate contains many "*" characters, matching the compiled regular expression against the host name can take a very long time.  Certificate validation happens before host name checking, so I think this is a minor issue only because it can only be triggered in cooperation with a CA (which seems unlikely).  The fix is to limit the number of "*" wildcards to a reasonable maximum (perhaps even 1). ``` | | | |

| ``` I would like to know what is the expected scenario: - does the attacker only control the certificate? - or does the attacker control both the certificate and the hostname being validated?  The reason is that the matching cost for a domain name fragment seems to be O(n**k), where n is the fragment length and k is the number of wildcards. Therefore, if the attacker controls both n and k, even limiting k to 2 already allows a quadratic complexity attack. ``` | | | |

Thanks, this may be a nice enhancement for 3.4.  For 3.2 and 3.3, I'd prefer to go the safe way of simply limiting the number of wildcards. If OpenSSL only accepts one per fragment, accepting one or two is certainly fine for Python as well :-) ``` | | | |

See e.g. [http://search-hadoop.com/c/Hadoop:hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/security/ssl/SSLHostnameVerifier.java](http://search-hadoop.com/c/Hadoop%3Ahadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/security/ssl/SSLHostnameVerifier.java)||dns ``` | | | |

## Topic

Updated python27 packages are now available as a part of Red Hat Software Collections 2.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language that supports modules, classes, exceptions, high-level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. The python27 packages provide a stable release of Python 2.7 with a number of additional utilities and database connectors for MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Security Fix(es):

The following fix was applied to the python component:

* The Python standard library HTTP client modules (such as httplib or urllib) did not perform verification of TLS/SSL certificates when connecting to HTTPS servers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to hijack connections and eavesdrop or modify transferred data. (CVE-2014-9365)

Note: The Python standard library was updated to make it possible to enable certificate verification by default. However, for backwards compatibility, verification remains disabled by default. Future updates may change this default. Refer to the Knowledgebase article 2039753 linked to in the References section for further details about this change. (BZ#1311044, BZ#1319774)

The following fix was applied to the python-pymongo component:

* A denial of service flaw was found in the way Python's SSL module implementation performed matching of certain certificate names. A remote attacker able to obtain a valid certificate that contained multiple wildcard characters could use this flaw to issue a request to validate such a certificate, resulting in excessive consumption of CPU. (CVE-2013-2099)

The following fix was applied to the python-pymongo and python-virtualenv components:

* Multiple flaws were found in the way Python's SSL module performed matching of certificate names containing wildcards. A remote attacker able to obtain a valid certificate that contained certain names with wildcards could have them incorrectly accepted by Python SSL clients, not following the RFC 6125 recommendations. (CVE-2013-7440)

The CVE-2013-2099 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer (Red Hat Product Security).

Bug Fix(es) and Enhancement(s):

The python27 SoftwareÂ Collection has been updated to a later version, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. Among others:

* The python27-PyYAML package has been added, which contains a Python YAML module. PyYAML is a YAML parser and emitter for Python; it is applicable for a broad range of tasks from complex configuration files to object serialization and persistance.
* Network security enhancements, described in the Python Enhancent Proposal 466, have been backported to the Python standard library. The security enhancements include, for example, new features in the ssl module, such as support for Server Name Indication (SNI) as well as support for new TLSv1.x protocols, new hash algorithms in the hashlib module, and much more.
* The python27-python-pip package has been upgraded to version 7.1.0.
* The python27-python-virtualenv package has been upgraded to verion 13.1.0.
* The python27-python-pymongo package has been upgraded to version 3.2.1.

(BZ#1301481, BZ#1297784, BZ#1111464, BZ#1319774)

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# USN-1983-1: Python 2.7 vulnerabilities

1 October 2013

Several security issues were fixed in Python.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [python2.7](/security/cves?package=python2.7) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

Florian Weimer discovered that Python incorrectly handled matching multiple

wildcards in ssl certificate hostnames. An attacker could exploit this to

cause Python to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 13.04. ([CVE-2013-2099](/security/CVE-2013-2099))

Ryan Sleevi discovered that Python did not properly handle certificates

with NULL characters in the Subject Alternative Name field. An attacker

could exploit this to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive

information or alter encrypted communications. ([CVE-2013-4238](/security/CVE-2013-4238))

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâs source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâs CVE database.

When a technologyâenabled and most likely used by defaultâcompletely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Consequence: a directory is created under /opt/rh/<collection\_name>/root/usr/share/licenses/<package\_name>/ where the files tagged with %license are being placed, which directory is not owned by the collection. As a result when uninstalling the collection or a specific package of it, the directory and the license files are not removed. Fix: Replace the %license tag with the %doc tag until directory permissions are defined in scl-utils-build Result: License files and directories are owned by the collection. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2016-05-31 10:26:15 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1334447#c0)  Branislav NÃ¡ter    2016-05-09 15:59:48 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When trying to uninstall whole python27 collection, there seem to be leftovers. Caught by /CoreOS/scl-utils/Sanity/general-ownership test Related to new pytho27-python-pip package. But reproduced only on RHEL-7!  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): python27-python-pip-7.1.0-1.el7  Steps to Reproduce: 1. try to remove whole collection  Actual results: :: [   FAIL   ] :: No files left after the yum remove  :: [ 00:49:53 ] :: /opt/rh/python27/root/usr/share/licenses  Expected results: No files present.  Additional info: Directory /opt/rh/python27/root/usr/share/licenses is not removed. Content of directory:  # ll /opt/rh/python27/root/usr/share/licenses drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 May  6 08:52 python27-python-pip-7.1.0   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1334447#c1)  Branislav NÃ¡ter    2016-05-09 16:06:52 UTC  ``` Full test log can be found here: <http://beaker-archive.app.eng.bos.redhat.com/beaker-logs/2016/05/13291/1329159/2704218/40857240/TESTOUT.log>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1334447#c2)  Charalampos Stratakis    2016-05-10 09:23:05 UTC  ``` The issue here (and the similar one that was opened for rh-python35-python-pymongo) is that rpm-4.11.3 introduced the %license tag for RHEL 7, however scl-utils-build package was not modified in regards to the addition of %license and %_licensedir macros.  As a result the macros are being expanded but the directories are not owned by the collection.

# USN-1984-1: Python 3.2 vulnerabilities

1 October 2013

Several security issues were fixed in Python.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [python3.2](/security/cves?package=python3.2) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

Florian Weimer discovered that Python incorrectly handled matching multiple

wildcards in ssl certificate hostnames. An attacker could exploit this to

cause Python to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2013-2099](/security/CVE-2013-2099))

Ryan Sleevi discovered that Python did not properly handle certificates

with NULL characters in the Subject Alternative Name field. An attacker

could exploit this to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive

information or alter encrypted communications. ([CVE-2013-4238](/security/CVE-2013-4238))

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [python3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python3.2)
  -
  [3.2.3-6ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python3.2/3.2.3-6ubuntu3.4)
* [python3.2-minimal](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python3.2)
  -
  [3.2.3-6ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python3.2/3.2.3-6ubuntu3.4)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [python3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python3.2)
  -
  [3.2.3-0ubuntu3.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python3.2/3.2.3-0ubuntu3.5)
