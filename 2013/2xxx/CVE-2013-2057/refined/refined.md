- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsanitized use of the "guestlanguage" cookie in file paths, combined with predictable file upload locations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user-controlled input (the "guestlanguage" cookie) when constructing file paths, and predictable locations of uploaded files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** File upload combined with manipulating the "guestlanguage" cookie. An attacker would upload a malicious file and then manipulate the "guestlanguage" cookie to force the application to execute the uploaded file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to upload a file and manipulate the "guestlanguage" cookie.
