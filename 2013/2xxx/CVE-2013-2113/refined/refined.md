{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-2113",
      "root_cause": "The `create` method in `app/controllers/users_controller.rb` improperly handles the `admin` attribute of a user during creation. It extracts the `admin` parameter from the params hash, deletes it, saves it to a local variable and then assigns it to the newly created user object bypassing the `:attr_protected` mechanism. This allows a non-admin user to set the admin flag during user creation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Mass assignment vulnerability",
        "Improper access control",
        "Bypassing of attribute protection mechanisms"
      ],
      "impact": "A non-admin user with permissions to create other (non-admin) users can create arbitrary admin users, leading to privilege escalation and potentially complete control over the Foreman system and managed systems.",
      "attack_vectors": "A non-admin user with the permission to create users sends a specially crafted POST request setting the `admin` parameter to `true` during user creation.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a valid account with permission to create new (non-admin) users in the Foreman application."
    },
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-2121",
      "root_cause": "The `create` method in `app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb` uses the `controller` attribute of the new bookmark in an `eval` statement without sanitization. This allows for arbitrary code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Code injection",
        "Unsafe use of `eval`",
         "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Any user with permissions to create bookmarks can execute arbitrary code and system commands with the privileges of the Foreman application, leading to full system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": "A user with permissions to create bookmarks sends a specially crafted POST request containing malicious code in the `controller` attribute.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a valid account with permission to create bookmarks in the Foreman application."
