| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=968166#c0)  Garth Mollett    2013-05-29 07:08:18 UTC  ``` Ramon de C Valle (rcvalle) reports:  There is a code injection vulnerability in the create method of the Bookmarks controller. The create method uses the (mass-assigned) controller attribute of the newly created bookmark in an eval statement without sanitizing it:  def create @bookmark = Bookmark.new(params[:bookmark])  respond_to do |format| if @bookmark.save format.html { redirect_to(eval(@bookmark.controller+"_path"), :notice => _('Bookmark was successfully created.')) } else format.html { render :action => "new" } end end end  Any user with permissions to create a bookmark can execute arbitrary code and arbitrary system commands by sending a specially-crafted POST request. The controller attribute is validated with the regular expression /\A(\S+)\Z/, which prevents us from using code containing spaces. However, this can be easily circumvented (see example (a)). The following are some possible example attacks, including arbitrary command execution.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=968166#c4)  Murray McAllister    2013-05-30 22:20:50 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Ramon de C Valle of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=968166#c5)  Dominic Cleal    2013-06-07 09:48:22 UTC  ``` Upstream tracker: <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2631>  A fix has been committed: commit ef4b97d177c58c9532730d53dca0517bc869a0ce Author: Joseph Mitchell Magen <jmagen> Date:   Mon Jun 3 18:11:32 2013 +0100      fixes #2631 - fix remote code execution via controller name ([CVE-2013-2121](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2121))  And cherry-picked to stable branches: 1.2-stable: 2f3839eb9928bd04876c2e1bfe509cd9ed120991 1.1-stable: 8920e796a285201e9e0f6af0220e79d257077d7d  The fix will be packaged as part of Foreman 1.2.0-RC2.  foreman-users announcement: <http://groups.google.com/group/foreman-users/browse_thread/thread/e96a4eff7ba08975>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=968166#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 16:05:18 UTC  ``` This issue is public: <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2631>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=968166#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-27 16:45:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0995 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0995.html>   ``` |  |

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0995)

## Topic

Updated Foreman packages that fix two security issues and multiple bugs
are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Foreman packages provide facilities for rapidly deploying Red Hat
OpenStack 3.0 ("Grizzly") Preview. These packages are provided as a
Technology Preview. For more information on the scope and nature of support
for items marked as Technology Preview, refer to
<https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/>

A flaw was found in the create method of the Foreman Bookmarks controller.
A user with privileges to create a bookmark could use this flaw to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Foreman, giving them
control of the system running Foreman (such as installing new packages) and
all systems managed by Foreman. (CVE-2013-2121)

A flaw was found in the way the Foreman UsersController controller handled
user creation. A non-admin user with privileges to create non-admin
accounts could use this flaw to create admin accounts, giving them control
of the system running Foreman (such as installing new packages) and all
systems managed by Foreman. (CVE-2013-2113)

These issues were discovered by Ramon de C Valle of the Red Hat Product
Security Team.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The cron job for Puppet had an incorrect path when installed via the

Foreman installer. (BZ#969531)

* This update removes provisioning templates and installation media for

unsupported client operating systems. (BZ#971545)

* Previously, the init script for Foreman was installed in the /opt/

directory, resulting in errors when attempting to use the "service"
command to control Foreman, and errors when installing or upgrading the
Foreman packages. As the Foreman service is not needed for Red Hat
OpenStack, this update removes the init script. (BZ#972755)

* Previously, after using Foreman to install controller and compute nodes,

it was not possible to launch compute instances. (BZ#972780)

* Previously, Foreman compiled assets for an incorrect path. The assets

were configured for "[fully qualified domain name]/foreman", which is not
where Foreman is served from in Red Hat OpenStack. (BZ#975068)

* Previously, the Foreman installer used a reference to an OpenStack

host's network interface instead of its own secondary interface when
creating a subnet, which could cause subnet creation to fail and a "rake
aborted!" message to be displayed. (BZ#976907)

Users of Foreman are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. In Red Hat OpenStack, Foreman runs on the Apache HTTP
Server using mod\_passenger. As such, after installing the updated packages,
the httpd service must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

The create method in app/controllers/users_controller.rb deletes the  user-controlled user[admin] parameter from the params hash but saves it to a  local variable and assigns it to the newly created user object bypassing the  :attr_protected mechanism.    def create     admin = params[:user].delete :admin     @user = User.new(params[:user]){|u| u.admin = admin }     if @user.save       @user.roles << Role.find_by_name("Anonymous") unless @user.roles.map(&:name).include? "Anonymous"       process_success     else       process_error     end   end  Any non-admin user with permissions to create other (non-admin) users (i.e. with Manager role) can create arbitrary admin users by sending a specially-crafted POST request.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=966804#c4)  Dominic Cleal    2013-06-07 09:48:17 UTC  ``` Upstream tracker: <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2630>  A fix has been committed: commit bae665de387d63f93740670ec2542db90084d0eb Author: Marek Hulan <mhulan> Date:   Thu Jun 6 11:25:17 2013 +0200      fixes #2630 - restrict assignment of roles to those a user has ([CVE-2013-2113](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2113))  And cherry-picked to stable branches: 1.2-stable: b52383d075abe611ac18db3925a787fa4b94b33b 1.1-stable: 7eadf32c83381aadc092cded68efff04ef20e07a  The fix will be packaged as part of Foreman 1.2.0-RC2.  foreman-users announcement: <http://groups.google.com/group/foreman-users/browse_thread/thread/e96a4eff7ba08975>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=966804#c5)  Murray McAllister    2013-06-13 07:20:19 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Ramon de C Valle of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=966804#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 16:05:30 UTC  ``` This issue is public: <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2630>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=966804#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-27 16:44:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0995 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0995.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=968166#c0)  Garth Mollett    2013-05-29 07:08:18 UTC  ``` Ramon de C Valle (rcvalle) reports:  There is a code injection vulnerability in the create method of the Bookmarks controller. The create method uses the (mass-assigned) controller attribute of the newly created bookmark in an eval statement without sanitizing it:  def create @bookmark = Bookmark.new(params[:bookmark])  respond_to do |format| if @bookmark.save format.html { redirect_to(eval(@bookmark.controller+"_path"), :notice => _('Bookmark was successfully created.')) } else format.html { render :action => "new" } end end end  Any user with permissions to create a bookmark can execute arbitrary code and arbitrary system commands by sending a specially-crafted POST request. The controller attribute is validated with the regular expression /\A(\S+)\Z/, which prevents us from using code containing spaces. However, this can be easily circumvented (see example (a)). The following are some possible example attacks, including arbitrary command execution.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=968166#c4)  Murray McAllister    2013-05-30 22:20:50 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Ramon de C Valle of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=968166#c5)  Dominic Cleal    2013-06-07 09:48:22 UTC  ``` Upstream tracker: <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2631>  A fix has been committed: commit ef4b97d177c58c9532730d53dca0517bc869a0ce Author: Joseph Mitchell Magen <jmagen> Date:   Mon Jun 3 18:11:32 2013 +0100      fixes #2631 - fix remote code execution via controller name ([CVE-2013-2121](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2121))  And cherry-picked to stable branches: 1.2-stable: 2f3839eb9928bd04876c2e1bfe509cd9ed120991 1.1-stable: 8920e796a285201e9e0f6af0220e79d257077d7d  The fix will be packaged as part of Foreman 1.2.0-RC2.  foreman-users announcement: <http://groups.google.com/group/foreman-users/browse_thread/thread/e96a4eff7ba08975>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=968166#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 16:05:18 UTC  ``` This issue is public: <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2631>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=968166#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-27 16:45:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0995 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0995.html>   ``` |  |

**Description**

Any non-admin user with permissions to create or edit other users is able to change the admin flag, or assign roles that they themselves don't have, enabling a privilege escalation.

By default, Foreman ships with a "Site manager" role which has the edit\_users permission. Any user assigned this role, or another with equivalent permissions, would be able to enable the admin flag or other roles on a user account.

This security issue has been assigned the identifier CVE-2013-2113. It affects all Foreman versions prior to 1.2.0-RC2.

Thank you to Ramon de C Valle for identifying and notifying us of this vulnerability.

# Technology Preview Features - Scope of Support

Technology Preview features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling you to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. However, these features are not fully supported under Red Hat Subscription Level Agreements, may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use. As Red Hat considers making future iterations of Technology Preview features generally available, we will attempt to resolve any issues that customers experience when using these features.

During the development of a Technology Preview feature, additional components may become available to the public for testing. Because Technology Preview features are still under development, Red Hat cannot guarantee the stability of such features. As a result, if you are using Technology Preview features, you may not be able to seamlessly upgrade to subsequent releases of that feature. While Red Hat intends to fully support Technology Preview features in future releases, we may discover that a feature does not meet the standards for enterprise viability. If this happens, we cannot guarantee that Technology Preview features will be released in a supported manner. Some Technology Preview features may only be available for specific hardware architectures.

Red Hat Global Support Services may create bug reports on behalf of support cases filed by subscribed customers. These bug reports will then be forwarded to Red Hat Engineering as proposed for inclusion in a future release.

**NOTE:** Customers exploring Technology Preview content must accept that there may not be any migration path from the Developer Preview to General Availability (GA) release installations. A full installation of the GA version may be required and any customer data may be need to be migrated or may be lost.
