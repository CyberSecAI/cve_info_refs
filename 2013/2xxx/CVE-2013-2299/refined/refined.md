- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the Advantech WebAccess application. Specifically, the server does not properly verify input sent from a malicious client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in another user's browser session, within the context of the vulnerable WebAccess application.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker sends invalid input through the WebAccess client interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated and able to send requests through the WebAccess client interface. The attack is performed remotely.
