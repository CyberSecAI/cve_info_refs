## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-235-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-235.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-235.51)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Dan Carpenter discovered an information leak in the HP Smart Array and

Compaq SMART2 disk-array driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-2147](/security/CVE-2013-2147))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-235-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-235.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-235.51)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-2016-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities

8 November 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

Dan Carpenter discovered an information leak in the HP Smart Array and

Compaq SMART2 disk-array driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-2147](/security/CVE-2013-2147))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-358-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-358.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-358.71)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1000429#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-08-23 12:40:20 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the Human Interface Device(CONFIG_HID) bus support along with the Pantherlord/GreenAsia game controller(CONFIG_HID_PANTHERLORD) driver, is vulnerable to a heap overflow flaw. It could occur when an HID device sends malicious output report to the kernel driver.  A local user with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the kernel resulting in DoS or potential privilege escalation to gain root access via arbitrary code execution.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1000429#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2013-08-23 12:44:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the version of the kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue affects the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 may address this issue.  Note: user would need physical access to the system to exploit this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1000429#c5)  Prasad Pandit    2013-08-29 13:05:06 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1002570](show_bug.cgi?id=1002570 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2892 Kernel: HID: pantherlord: heap overflow flaw [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1000429#c6)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-13 01:04:41 UTC  ``` kernel-3.10.11-200.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

# USN-2020-1: Linux kernel (Raring HWE) vulnerabilities

8 November 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-raring](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-raring) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Raring

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Dan Carpenter discovered an information leak in the HP Smart Array and

Compaq SMART2 disk-array driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-2147](/security/CVE-2013-2147))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LENOVO\_TPKBD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service via

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2894](/security/CVE-2013-2894))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Miroslav Vadkerti discovered a flaw in how the permissions for network

sysctls are handled in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to have privileged access to files in /proc/sys/net/.

([CVE-2013-4270](/security/CVE-2013-4270))

Wannes Rombouts reported a vulnerability in the networking tuntap interface

of the Linux kernel. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could

leverage this flaw to gain full admin privileges. ([CVE-2013-4343](/security/CVE-2013-4343))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-33-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-33.48~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-33.48~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-43-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-43.66~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-43.66~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Dan Carpenter discovered an information leak in the HP Smart Array and

Compaq SMART2 disk-array driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-2147](/security/CVE-2013-2147))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LENOVO\_TPKBD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service via

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2894](/security/CVE-2013-2894))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Miroslav Vadkerti discovered a flaw in how the permissions for network

sysctls are handled in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to have privileged access to files in /proc/sys/net/.

([CVE-2013-4270](/security/CVE-2013-4270))

Wannes Rombouts reported a vulnerability in the networking tuntap interface

of the Linux kernel. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could

leverage this flaw to gain full admin privileges. ([CVE-2013-4343](/security/CVE-2013-4343))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-33-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.8.0-33.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.8.0-33.48)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Subject: Linux HID security flaws

Hi,

I've found several issues in the Linux HID code. They are making their way
into the Linux kernel via the linux-input tree now:

<http://marc.info/?l=linux-input&m=137772180514608&w=1>
0001-HID-validate-HID-report-id-size.patch
CVE-2013-2888
Requires CONFIG_HID
Memory write via arbitrary heap array index. This is the most serious,
IMO, as it allows (on 32-bit) access to the entire memory range (the
index is unsigned 32 bit). This is mitigated slightly by the fact that
the starting address is at an "unknown" location on the heap, and that
the value written is an "arbitrary" kernel pointer. Still, this could
almost certainly be turned into full kernel execution given enough
study.

<http://marc.info/?l=linux-input&m=137772181214612&w=1>
0002-HID-provide-a-helper-for-validating-hid-reports.patch

Can leak up to 12K of kernel memory contents to device, or NULL deref Oops
DoS

<http://marc.info/?l=linux-input&m=137772189314633&w=1>
0010-HID-ntrig-validate-feature-report-details.patch

vulnerable with this check.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Dan Carpenter discovered an information leak in the HP Smart Array and

Compaq SMART2 disk-array driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-2147](/security/CVE-2013-2147))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](/security/CVE-2013-4470))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-236-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-236.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-236.52)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1441-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1441.60](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1441.60)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

crash) via a malformed ASCONF chunk, related to
net/sctp/sm\_make\_chunk.c and net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c (bnc#902346).
\* CVE-2014-3687: The sctp\_assoc\_lookup\_asconf\_ack function in
net/sctp/associola.c in the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel
through 3.17.2 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(panic) via duplicate ASCONF chunks that trigger an incorrect uncork
within the side-effect interpreter (bnc#902349).
\* CVE-2014-3688: The SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel before
3.17.4 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption) by triggering a large number of chunks in an
associations output queue, as demonstrated by ASCONF probes, related
to net/sctp/inqueue.c and net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c (bnc#902351).
\* CVE-2014-3690: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 3.17.2 on Intel processors did not ensure that the
value in the CR4 control register remains the same after a VM entry,
which allowed host OS users to kill arbitrary processes or cause a
denial of service (system disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access,
as demonstrated by PR\_SET\_TSC prctl calls within a modified copy of
QEMU (bnc#902232).
\* CVE-2014-4608: Multiple integer overflows in the
lzo1x\_decompress\_safe function in lib/lzo/lzo1x\_decompress\_safe.c in
the LZO decompressor in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 allowed
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) via a crafted Literal Run (bnc#883948).
\* CVE-2014-4943: The PPPoL2TP feature in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ppp.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.15.6 allowed local users to gain privileges
by leveraging data-structure differences between an l2tp socket and
an inet socket (bnc#887082).
\* CVE-2014-5471: Stack consumption vulnerability in the
parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allowed local users to cause a denial of
service (uncontrolled recursion, and system crash or reboot) via a
crafted iso9660 image with a CL entry referring to a directory entry
that has a CL entry (bnc#892490).
\* CVE-2014-5472: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allowed local
users to cause a denial of service (unkillable mount process) via a
crafted iso9660 image with a self-referential CL entry (bnc#892490).
\* CVE-2014-7826: kernel/trace/trace\_syscalls.c in the Linux kernel
through 3.17.2 did not properly handle private syscall numbers
during use of the ftrace subsystem, which allowed local users to
gain privileges or cause a denial of service (invalid pointer
dereference) via a crafted application (bnc#904013).
\* CVE-2014-7841: The sctp\_process\_param function in
net/sctp/sm\_make\_chunk.c in the SCTP implementation in the Linux
kernel before 3.17.4, when ASCONF is used, allowed remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system
crash) via a malformed INIT chunk (bnc#905100).
\* CVE-2014-7842: Race condition in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux
kernel before 3.17.4 allowed guest OS users to cause a denial of
service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application that performs an
MMIO transaction or a PIO transaction to trigger a guest userspace
emulation error report, a similar issue to CVE-2010-5313
(bnc#905312).
\* CVE-2014-8134: The paravirt\_ops\_setup function in
arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c in the Linux kernel through 3.18 uses an
improper paravirt\_enabled setting for KVM guest kernels, which made
it easier for guest OS users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism
via a crafted application that reads a 16-bit value (bnc#909078).
\* CVE-2014-8369: The kvm\_iommu\_map\_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c
in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 miscalculates the number of pages
during the handling of a mapping failure, which allowed guest OS
users to cause a denial of service (host OS page unpinning) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging guest OS
privileges. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect
fix for CVE-2014-3601 (bnc#902675).
\* CVE-2014-8559: The d\_walk function in fs/dcache.c in the Linux
kernel through 3.17.2 did not properly maintain the semantics of
rename\_lock, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(deadlock and system hang) via a crafted application (bnc#903640).
\* CVE-2014-8709: The ieee80211\_fragment function in net/mac80211/tx.c
in the Linux kernel before 3.13.5 did not properly maintain a
certain tail pointer, which allowed remote attackers to obtain
sensitive cleartext information by reading packets (bnc#904700).
\* CVE-2014-9584: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 did not validate a
length value in the Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field,
which allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image (bnc#912654).
\* CVE-2014-9585: The vdso\_addr function in arch/x86/vdso/vma.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.18.2 did not properly choose memory locations
for the vDSO area, which made it easier for local users to bypass
the ASLR protection mechanism by guessing a location at the end of a
PMD (bnc#912705).

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1490)

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way IP packets with an Internet Header Length

(ihl) of zero were processed in the skb\_flow\_dissect() function in the
Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger an infinite
loop in the kernel, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4348,
Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-4387, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the creation of

temporary IPv6 addresses. If the IPv6 privacy extension was enabled
(/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use\_tempaddr set to '2'), an attacker on
the local network could disable IPv6 temporary address generation, leading
to a potential information disclosure. (CVE-2013-0343, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled HID (Human Interface

Device) reports with an out-of-bounds Report ID. An attacker with physical
access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888,
Moderate)

* Heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the

Pantherlord/GreenAsia game controller driver, the Logitech force feedback
drivers, and the Logitech Unifying receivers driver handled HID reports.
An attacker with physical access to the system could use these flaws to
crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-2892, CVE-2013-2893, CVE-2013-2895, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the N-Trig touch

screen driver handled HID reports. An attacker with physical access to the
system could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2013-2896, Moderate)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's device

mapper subsystem, under certain conditions, interpreted data written to
snapshot block devices. An attacker could use this flaw to read data from
disk blocks in free space, which are normally inaccessible. (CVE-2013-4299,
Moderate)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the tun\_set\_iff() function in the

Universal TUN/TAP device driver implementation in the Linux kernel.
A privileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
further escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4343, Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in

the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead
to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected
when ANSI CPRNG was used. (CVE-2013-4345, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 SCTP implementation

interacted with the IPsec subsystem. This resulted in unencrypted SCTP
packets being sent over the network even though IPsec encryption was
enabled. An attacker able to inspect these SCTP packets could use this flaw
to obtain potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-4350, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Fujitsu for reporting CVE-2013-4299 and Stephan
Mueller for reporting CVE-2013-4345. The CVE-2013-4348 issue was discovered
by Jason Wang of Red Hat.

Bug fix:

* RoCE appeared to be supported in the MRG Realtime kernel even when the

required user space packages from the HPN channel were not installed.
The Realtime kernel now checks for the HPN channel packages before exposing
the RoCE interfaces. RoCE devices appear as plain 10GigE devices if the
needed HPN channel user space packages are not installed. (BZ#1012993)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
kernel to version kernel-rt-3.8.13-rt14, and correct these issues.
The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

From: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>

A HID device could send a malicious output report that would cause the
lg, lg3, and lg4 HID drivers to write beyond the output report allocation
during an event, causing a heap overflow:

[  325.245240] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=046d, idProduct=c287
...
[  414.518960] BUG kmalloc-4096 (Not tainted): Redzone overwritten

Additionally, while lg2 did correctly validate the report details, it was
cleaned up and shortened.

CVE-2013-2893
