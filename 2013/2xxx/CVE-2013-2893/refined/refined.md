CVE-2013-2893: Linux Kernel HID Subsystem Vulnerability

The provided content reveals a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem, specifically affecting Logitech force feedback drivers.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of output report details within the HID subsystem, specifically when either of `CONFIG_LOGITECH_FF`, `CONFIG_LOGIG940_FF`, or `CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF` are enabled. This allows a malicious HID device to send specially crafted output reports to the kernel, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The core weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking when handling HID output reports. This allows a crafted report to write beyond the allocated heap memory.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The drivers fail to validate the length and content of the incoming HID reports, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most direct impact is a kernel crash due to the heap overflow, resulting in a DoS.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The heap overflow can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to gain root privileges. The content states that it's "Userspace-assisted small past-end-of-heap-alloc zeroing", this indicates that the attacker has control over some of the data being written.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physically Proximate Attack:** The attacker needs physical access to the system and must be able to plug in a specially crafted malicious HID device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs to be physically present to connect a malicious HID device.
*   **Crafted HID Device:** The attacker must possess or be able to create a malicious HID device capable of sending specially formatted output reports to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Target System Configured with HID driver enabled:** The targeted system must have one of the vulnerable configurations enabled, namely `CONFIG_LOGITECH_FF`, `CONFIG_LOGIG940_FF`, or `CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple drivers which are responsible for handling the different kinds of Logitech devices.
*   The patch for this vulnerability introduces a helper function to validate HID report sanity and utilizes it to prevent out-of-bounds writes.
*   Red Hat states that this issue does not affect the versions of Linux kernel shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, but affects Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.
*   Ubuntu states that multiple versions of the Linux Kernel are vulnerable, which include Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04, 12.10 and 13.04
*   openSUSE also patched this vulnerability for their Evergreen 11.4 Linux kernel.
