Based on the provided commit message and code diff, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `AuthorManager::fetch()` function of the Symphony CMS. The vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `$sortby` variable, before it's incorporated into a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The `$sortby` variable, intended to control the ordering of results, is directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:**  An attacker could inject malicious SQL code that could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration/disclosure: Access to sensitive data in the database.
    - Data modification/corruption: Altering or deleting data within the database.
    - Privilege escalation: potentially gaining higher privileges within the database.
    - Denial of service:  Causing the database to become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker would need to manipulate the value of the `sortby` parameter in the HTTP request that triggers the affected functionality in the CMS, injecting SQL code there.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The commit message indicates the vulnerability affects the "Authors page," implying that an attacker would need to have a valid authenticated session to access and exploit this vulnerability. It is not clear from the provided information if the level of privileges is relevant to the exploitation.
