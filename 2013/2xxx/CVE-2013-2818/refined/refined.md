- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the Alstom e-terra*control* DNP Master Driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not correctly validate input, allowing for the possibility of sending the software into an infinite loop, causing a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause the software to enter an infinite loop, resulting in a crash. The device must be shut down and restarted to reset the loop state.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **IP-based:** A specially crafted TCP packet sent from an outstation on an IP-based network. This attack can be performed remotely.
    - **Serial-based:** A specially crafted packet is sent through a serial connection. This attack requires physical access to the master station.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **IP-based:** Moderate skill level to craft the malicious packet, remote access.
    - **Serial-based:** High skill level, physical access to the device or social engineering.
