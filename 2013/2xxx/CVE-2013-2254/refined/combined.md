#### Description

While updating the AbstractCreateOperation to use new CRUD support in POST servlet has been some lost in translation.

The previous code looked like

```

    protected Node deepGetOrCreateNode(Session session, String path,
            Map<String, RequestProperty> reqProperties, List<Modification> changes,
            VersioningConfiguration versioningConfiguration)
            throws RepositoryException {
        if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
            log.debug("Deep-creating Node '{}'", path);
        }
        if (path == null || !path.startsWith("/")) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("path must be an absolute path.");
        }
        // get the starting node
        String startingNodePath = path;
        Node startingNode = null;
        while (startingNode == null) {
            if (startingNodePath.equals("/")) {
                startingNode = session.getRootNode();
            } else if (session.itemExists(startingNodePath)) {
                startingNode = (Node) session.getItem(startingNodePath);
                updateNodeType(session, startingNodePath, reqProperties, changes, versioningConfiguration);
                updateMixins(session, startingNodePath, reqProperties, changes, versioningConfiguration);
            } else {
                int pos = startingNodePath.lastIndexOf('/');
                if (pos > 0) {
                    startingNodePath = startingNodePath.substring(0, pos);
                } else {
                    startingNodePath = "/";
                }
            }
        }

```

while the updated is

```
protected Resource deepGetOrCreateNode(final ResourceResolver resolver,
                    final String path,
                    final Map<String, RequestProperty> reqProperties,
                    final List<Modification> changes,
                    final VersioningConfiguration versioningConfiguration)
    throws PersistenceException, RepositoryException {
        if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
            log.debug("Deep-creating resource '{}'", path);
        }
        if (path == null || !path.startsWith("/")) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("path must be an absolute path.");
        }
        // get the starting resource
        String startingResourcePath = path;
        Resource startingResource = null;
        while (startingResource == null) {
            if (startingResourcePath.equals("/")) {
                startingResource = resolver.getResource("/");
            } else if (resolver.getResource(startingResourcePath) != null) {
                startingResource = resolver.getResource(startingResourcePath);
                updateNodeType(resolver, startingResourcePath, reqProperties, changes, versioningConfiguration);
                updateMixins(resolver, startingResourcePath, reqProperties, changes, versioningConfiguration);
            } else {
                int pos = startingResourcePath.lastIndexOf('/');
                if (pos > 0) {
                    startingResourcePath = startingResourcePath.substring(0, pos);
                } else {
                    startingResourcePath = "/";
                }
            }
        }

```

The main difference is in that the

startingNode = session.getRootNode(); could throw a RepositoryException e.g. if the session did not have enough permission while startingResource = resolver.getResource("/"); would just return null.

This might cause a theoretical infinite loop.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
