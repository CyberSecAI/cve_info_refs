Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2261:

**CVE-2013-2261: Cryptocat for Chrome manifest.json img/keygen.gif Software Detection Weakness**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** This CVE relates to a weakness in how Cryptocat for Chrome is detected based on the presence of `img/keygen.gif` in `manifest.json`. This suggests a flawed method of detecting the software, which could potentially be exploited to either misidentify the software or bypass detection mechanisms.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a software detection weakness. Relying on the presence of a specific file in the manifest for software identification is not robust and could be easily spoofed or manipulated. This is a weakness that can lead to issues with software identification or version detection.

*  **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is related to software detection mechanisms. While not directly leading to data breaches, this vulnerability could be leveraged to bypass detection mechanisms or potentially misinform users or system about the version or legitimacy of Cryptocat for Chrome.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through manipulating or spoofing the `manifest.json` file of Cryptocat, or creating a fake extension which includes the `img/keygen.gif` to impersonate Cryptocat.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would require the ability to modify or control the manifest.json file or create an extension to exploit this vulnerability.
