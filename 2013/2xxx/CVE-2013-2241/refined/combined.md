| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=981198#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-04 09:06:03 UTC  ``` Multiple information exposure flaws were found in the way data rest core module of Gallery version 3, an open source project with the goal to develop and support leading photo sharing web application solutions, used to previously restrict access to certain items of the photo album. A remote attacker, valid Gallery 3 user, could use this flaw to possibly obtain sensitive information (file, resize or thumb path of the item in question).  References: [1] <http://galleryproject.org/gallery_3_0_9>  Upstream ticket: [2] <http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gallery/ticket/2074>  Relevant upstream patch (against 3.0.x branch): [3] <https://github.com/gallery/gallery3/commit/cbbcf1b4791762d7da0ea7b6c4f4b551a4d9caed>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=981198#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-04 09:21:28 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the gallery3 package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17, 18, and 19. Please schedule an update.  --  This issue affects the versions of the gallery3 package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL-6. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=981198#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-04 09:22:29 UTC  ``` CVE Request:   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/07/04/7>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=981198#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-04 09:24:46 UTC  ```  Created gallery3 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 981218](show_bug.cgi?id=981218 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2138 gallery3 various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 981219](show_bug.cgi?id=981219 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2138 gallery3 various flaws [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=981198#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-08 15:24:00 UTC  ``` Further [CVE-2013-2241](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2241) issue details clarification from Shad Laws of Gallery 3 upstream (<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/07/05/3>):  A quick clarification on issue #2: the problem wasn't the item information or paths, but rather the original-sized image file.  A legitimate user with "view" privileges for an item should be able to: - get the item info and image file links (e.g. ".../rest/data/123?size=thumb", etc.) - follow the links and get the "thumb" and "resize" image files themselves. - guess the "full" image file link without thinking too hard (e.g. ".../rest/data/123?size=full") - follow the link and get the "full" image file itself **ONLY** if they have "view_full" access.  The problem was that this last condition wasn't being properly enforced.   ``` |  |

Subject: Re: CVE Request -- gallery3 (3.0.9): Fixing two security flaws

Hello everyone,

A quick clarification on issue #2: the problem wasn't the item information
or paths, but rather the original-sized image file.

A legitimate user with "view" privileges for an item should be able to:
- get the item info and image file links (e.g.
".../rest/data/123?size=thumb", etc.)
- follow the links and get the "thumb" and "resize" image files themselves.
- guess the "full" image file link without thinking too hard (e.g.
".../rest/data/123?size=full")
- follow the link and get the "full" image file itself **ONLY** if they
have "view_full" access.

The problem was that this last condition wasn't being properly enforced.

Thanks again, and sorry for the delay in response!
Shad
