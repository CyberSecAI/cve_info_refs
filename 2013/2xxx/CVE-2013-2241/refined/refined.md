Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2241:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `data_rest` core module of Gallery 3, specifically in how it enforces access control when serving full-sized images. The module failed to properly check if a user had "view_full" access before allowing them to obtain the original, full-sized image file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The system did not enforce the "view_full" permission requirement for accessing full-sized images via the `data_rest` module, leading to unauthorized information exposure.
- **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability allowed users with only "view" permissions to bypass access restrictions and retrieve full-sized images, which they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A valid Gallery 3 user with "view" access could bypass intended restrictions to obtain full-sized image files, potentially exposing sensitive content.
- **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** Users could access resources (full-size images) without having the correct permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL manipulation:**  A user with view access could guess or manipulate the URL to request a full-sized image (e.g., ".../rest/data/123?size=full") even if they lack "view_full" permissions, and the system would incorrectly provide the full image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Gallery 3 user account:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the vulnerable Gallery 3 instance.
- **"View" access:** The attacker must have at least "view" privileges for the target album item.
- **Knowledge of URL structure:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how to construct the URL to request the full-sized image

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Gallery 3 versions prior to 3.0.9.
- The fix involves ensuring the `access::required("view_full", $item)` is checked before serving the full sized image.
- The vulnerability is located in the `modules/gallery/helpers/data_rest.php` file, specifically in the `static function get($request)` method, where access control checks were not properly enforced.
