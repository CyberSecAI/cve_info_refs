Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-2017

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's Virtual Ethernet (veth) driver. This flaw occurs due to incorrect handling of socket buffers (sk\_buffs) when the network experiences congestion. Specifically, an sk\_buff was being freed twice in certain situations due to the interaction between `netif_rx()` and `dev_forward_skb()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The core vulnerability is a double-free condition. The `veth_xmit` function was freeing the skb, and then `dev_forward_skb()` was also freeing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Crash:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a system crash due to the double free.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Congestion:** The vulnerability is triggered during network congestion when the virtual ethernet driver is in use. An attacker could potentially create or exacerbate network congestion to trigger this condition and cause a crash.
- **Remote Exploitation:**  The issue is reachable by a remote attacker through network traffic manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send network traffic to a system utilizing a vulnerable veth driver.
- **Congestion Creation:**  The attacker needs to create a condition where the veth driver has to deal with congestion causing it to double free the `sk_buff`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel version 2.6.33-rc1.
- It was fixed in Linux kernel version 2.6.34.
- The fix involves ensuring that `dev_forward_skb()` always consumes the sk\_buff, preventing the double-free in the veth driver.
- The fix was implemented in commit `6ec82562ffc6f297d0de36d65776cff8e5704867`.
