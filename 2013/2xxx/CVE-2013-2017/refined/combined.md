veth: Dont kfree\_skb() after dev\_forward\_skb()

```
In case of congestion, netif_rx() frees the skb, so we must assume
dev_forward_skb() also consume skb.

Bug introduced by commit [4454096](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/445409602c09219767c06497c0dc2285eac244ed)
(veth: move loopback logic to common location)

We must change dev_forward_skb() to always consume skb, and veth to not
double free it.
