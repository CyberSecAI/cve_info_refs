Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-2106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is present in WebAuth versions before 4.6.1. It is described as an "authentication credential disclosure" issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Credential Disclosure:** The core weakness is that the software was leaking authentication credentials. The specific mechanism of disclosure isn't detailed, but it implies a vulnerability that could expose sensitive user authentication information.
*   Vulnerable versions are specifically identified as 4.4.1 through 4.5.2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact:** The primary impact is a high confidentiality risk. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user credentials.
*   **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not impact the integrity or availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network. This implies the vulnerability is accessible to remote attackers.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low meaning it is easy to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any existing privileges or accounts on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any required interaction from a user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the central server component of WebAuth.
*   The affected timeframe was relatively short (four months) between the release of vulnerable and fixed versions.
*   WebAuth was distributed with Debian and Ubuntu, suggesting a widespread potential impact.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The vulnerability allows for unauthorized disclosure of user credentials. Exploitation is network-based, does not require special privileges or user interaction and has a high impact on confidentiality. The affected component is the server side of WebAuth, specifically versions 4.4.1 to 4.5.2.

The vulnerability was found in WebAuth, a web single sign-on system.
