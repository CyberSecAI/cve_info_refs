Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2851:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's block layer, specifically in the `register_disk` function within `block/genhd.c`. The `disk_name` field, which is used to name block devices, is treated as a format string in several places within the kernel's block layer. This means that if the `disk_name` contains format string specifiers (e.g., %x, %n), these specifiers can be processed by the kernel leading to various issues depending on the specifier used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The core weakness is that the `disk_name` field, which is intended to be a simple name, is used as a format string in `dev_set_name` within `register_disk`, as well as a few other places, making it exploitable. This is particularly exploitable in the `md` driver which allows a user to set the disk name.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local, privileged user (with UID 0) can exploit this vulnerability to gain kernel-level (ring 0) privileges. This could be achieved by crafting a disk name using format string specifiers, which when processed by the kernel leads to arbitrary code execution.  The most obvious examples include the use of the '%n' specifier which will cause memory corruption and a crash, which, when done correctly could be used for exploitation.
*   **Denial of Service:** By using a format string specifier like %n, the kernel would attempt to write to the memory addresses specified by the format string, resulting in a kernel crash (denial of service).

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The vulnerability is triggered through local access.
*   **md driver:**  The `md` (multiple devices) driver provides a mechanism to define arbitrary disk names, which are then used in the format string vulnerability. Specifically, setting the `/sys/module/md_mod/parameters/new_array` parameter to a name with format string specifiers leads to the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*  **Privileged user:**  The attacker needs to be a privileged user with UID 0 to leverage the ability to modify the device names using the `/sys/module/md_mod/parameters/new_array` parameter or through the `b43` `fwpostfix` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as "not too serious" except for "certain environments" which is generally not specific enough for proper impact assessment.
*   The provided test case is trivial, involving creating a device with a disk name containing format string specifiers using `/sys/module/md_mod/parameters/new_array`.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in the upstream kernel and has been backported in various distributions (Red Hat, Ubuntu, and SUSE).
*  The vulnerability is triggered in `dev_set_name`, `kthread_create`, and the `osd_probe` functions.

In summary, CVE-2013-2851 is a format string vulnerability in the Linux kernel's block layer, specifically in the way disk names are used. It can be exploited by local privileged users to escalate their privileges or cause a denial of service. This vulnerability highlights the importance of treating external inputs, even seemingly benign ones like device names, with appropriate security measures to prevent format string vulnerabilities.
