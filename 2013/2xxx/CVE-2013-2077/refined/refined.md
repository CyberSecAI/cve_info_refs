Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2077:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Xen handles the `XRSTOR` instruction. Processors perform validity checks on the data passed to `XRSTOR`. While Xen controls the memory location for this data, it does not restrict the contents. This allows a fault to occur during `XRSTOR` execution. The hypervisor lacked exception recovery code for `XRSTOR` (similar to `FXRSTOR`)

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Exception Handling:** The core issue is the lack of proper exception handling within the hypervisor when the `XRSTOR` instruction encounters an invalid data input, leading to a crash.
*   **Unrestricted XRSTOR Data:** The hypervisor fails to validate or sanitize the content of the data passed to the `XRSTOR` instruction, creating a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious or buggy unprivileged user space within a PV guest can cause the entire host system to crash by triggering the vulnerability. This results in a complete disruption of the hypervisor.
*   **Hypervisor Crash:** The vulnerability leads to an unhandled exception and a hypervisor crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local PV Guest User:** A malicious or buggy process running within a Paravirtualized (PV) guest can trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attack vector requires the usage of the `XRSTOR` instruction with crafted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a PV guest that has access to the `XRSTOR` instruction.
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the content of the memory used in the XRSTOR instruction.

**Affected Xen Versions:**

*   Xen versions 4.0 and onwards are vulnerable when run on systems with processors supporting XSAVE.
*   Xen versions 4.0.2 through 4.0.4 as well as in Xen 4.1.x have XSAVE support disabled by default and are not vulnerable unless explicitly enabled.
*   Xen 3.x and earlier are not vulnerable.
*   HVM guests are not directly vulnerable, as the hypervisor functions for XRSTOR are only accessible to control tools.

**Mitigation:**

*   Disabling XSAVE support via the "no-xsave" hypervisor command line option avoids the vulnerability.
*   Applying the provided patches resolves this issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by the lack of error checking for data being restored by the `XRSTOR` instruction
* The vulnerability allows local PV guests to cause a DoS via unhandled exception/hypervisor crash.
*   The vulnerability is related to "missing exception recovery".
*   The content of the memory used in the XRSTOR instruction is not properly restricted.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "high" severity and "exploitable locally" in the Gentoo Security Advisory.
* This issue affects all architectures running vulnerable versions of Xen, as stated in Gentoo Security Advisory.
