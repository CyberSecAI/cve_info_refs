{
  "CVE-2013-2004": {
    "Description": "Unbounded recursion in GetDatabase() and _XimParseStringFile() when parsing include files. These calls read in files and handle C-style '#include' directives to include other files, and have no limit for how many levels deep they will go, including allowing files to #include themselves, until the stack overflows from the recursive function calling patterns.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of a limit on the recursion depth when processing include directives in configuration files. The functions `GetDatabase()` and `_XimParseStringFile()` recursively call themselves when encountering an `#include` directive, leading to a stack overflow if a file includes itself or if there are too many nested includes.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded Recursion",
      "Stack Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "The unbounded recursion leads to a stack overflow, causing the application to crash, resulting in a denial of service. The vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious configuration file with nested or self-referencing `#include` directives. The crafted file is then processed by a vulnerable application or library using `GetDatabase()` or `_XimParseStringFile()`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a file that will be parsed by the vulnerable code, which can be done through environment variables."
