## Installation

1. Upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

## FAQ

### I‚Äôm finished with it, and disabled the plugin, but the ‚Äúunder construction‚Äù message is still showing up!

If you‚Äôve disabled the plugin, it won‚Äôt show anything anymore. To be extra super-sure, try deleting the plugin files. Usually, though, the issue is that you‚Äôre seeing a cached version of the page. Try force-refreshing your browser, and then try clearing your cache on the server and force refreshing again. If you have a caching plugin like W3 Total Cache, make sure you clear that too!

### I can‚Äôt see the under construction page!

As long as you‚Äôre logged in, you won‚Äôt be able to see it. That‚Äôs a feature! This way, while you‚Äôre logged in you can work as usual. To preview what it looks like, either a) log out, or b) try viewing it in another browser

### What kind of HTML can I put in?

You enter the contents of the entire HTML file. You can include inline styles, or links to external style sheets and external images.

### I have an idea for your plugin!

That‚Äôs great. I‚Äôm always open to user input, and I‚Äôd like to add anything I think will be useful to a lot of people. Visit the homepage for this plugin and leave a comment, and I‚Äôll add the functionality as soon as I can.

### I found a bug!

Oops. That‚Äôs sure awkward. If you find a problem with this plugin that you can reproduce, if you wouldn‚Äôt mind leaving a message on the homepage for this plugin with how you made it break, I‚Äôd really like to try and fix it! Also, this is incompatible with a couple plugins out there, specifically ones that change the default login url.

### This plugin has helped me a lot, how can I support it?

I‚Äôve had a few people ask me this. If you like it, please go to WordPress.org and rate it! Then more people can enjoy it. If you REALLY like it, you can always buy me a coffee. üôÇ There‚Äôs a donate link on my site.

### You didn‚Äôt answer my question here

Sorry, I get a lot of questions. But visit the homepage for this plugin and leave me a comment. They go right to my inbox, and well I might not be able to for a few days, I promise I‚Äôll get back to you.

Figured out my caching issue, though changing to 3 stars because it‚Äôs still a frustrating UI. Why are <style> tags not allowed in the HTML view?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
