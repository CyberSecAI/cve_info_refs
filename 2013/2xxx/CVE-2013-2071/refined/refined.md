Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the way Apache Tomcat handled `RuntimeExceptions` thrown within `AsyncListener` implementations. Specifically, the `AsyncContextImpl.fireOnComplete` method only caught `IOExceptions`, not `RuntimeExceptions`. When a `RuntimeException` was thrown, the `Request` object was not properly recycled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incorrect Exception Handling**: The `AsyncContextImpl` class had inadequate exception handling in its `fireOnComplete`, `fireOnTimeout`, `fireOnStartAsync`, and `fireOnError` methods when dealing with `AsyncListeners`. These methods were only catching `IOExceptions`, while `AsyncListeners` can potentially throw other types of exceptions like `RuntimeExceptions`.
2.  **Request Object Not Recycled**: When a `RuntimeException` was thrown by an `AsyncListener`, the associated `Request` object was not recycled. This led to state persistence from the previous request being available for subsequent requests.
3. **State Leakage**: Due to improper recycling, attributes or state of a previous request could persist into a new request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Information Disclosure**:  Information from a previous request, such as session data or other attributes, could be exposed to a subsequent, unrelated request, potentially leading to information disclosure.
2.  **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Although not explicitly described as a main vector, the bugzilla entry mentions a stack overflow and incorrect handling that could have been related to a resource consumption DoS.
3. **Application malfunction**: Inconsistent behaviour, where one request may be handled by the servlet of another request if they happen to reuse the same processor.
4. **Incorrect Request Processing**:  A new request would potentially be handled by the wrong servlet/application, due to the servlet and its data not being cleared. This could lead to unexpected errors, access to wrong resources, and overall application malfunction.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  An attacker does not directly trigger the vulnerability but exploits application bugs that trigger a `RuntimeException` in a `AsyncListener`.
2. An attacker would depend on another request triggering a `RuntimeException` in an `AsyncListener`, so that his own request reuses the unreleased request object and its associated state.
3. It is an opportunistic issue, where a "victim" request must first trigger the bug before another request is affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Ability to make requests**: An attacker should be able to make a request to the server, which will cause a listener to throw a `RuntimeException`.
2.  **Knowledge or Opportunity**: The attacker would need to know that a specific application is vulnerable, or opportunistically send enough requests, hoping that one will trigger the exception.
3.  **No direct server access is needed**: The attacker doesn't need any sort of server access, just the ability to send requests to a vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details (from the content):**

*   **Affected Versions:** Apache Tomcat 7.0.x versions prior to 7.0.40.
*   **Fix:** The fix involved modifying `AsyncContextImpl.java` to catch `Throwable` instead of just `IOException` in the `fireOnComplete`, `fireOnTimeout`, `fireOnStartAsync`, and `fireOnError` methods. This ensured that all exceptions, including `RuntimeExceptions`, were properly caught, thus allowing the proper recycling of the `Request` object.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability was classified as "moderate" because it was difficult to exploit deliberately, but the risk was that it would occur unexpectedly if the vulnerable `AsyncListener` was present.
*   **Test case:** A test case was provided that demonstrates that the state of previous requests is available in subsequent requests after an exception in an AsyncListener.
* **Real world exploit:** Initially, the bug was reported as an occurrence of a POST request reaching the doGet method.

In summary, CVE-2013-2071 is a moderate severity vulnerability arising from improper exception handling in Apache Tomcat's `AsyncContextImpl`, leading to request state leakage and potentially incorrect request processing when an application's `AsyncListener` throws a `RuntimeException`. This could result in information disclosure and potentially other unexpected application behavior. The fix was to catch all `Throwables` instead of just `IOExceptions` in the listener handling methods.
