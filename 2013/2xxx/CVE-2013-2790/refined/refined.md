- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the IOServer DNP3 driver on the master station. The software does not validate or incorrectly validates input received on Port 20000/TCP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the IOServer driver's failure to properly validate input, allowing an attacker to craft unexpected input, which leads to unintended system behavior. Specifically, the vulnerability is caused by improper input validation (CWE-20).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability causes the master station device to enter an infinite loop, requiring manual restart to recover. This results in a denial of service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a specially crafted TCP packet sent to the master station on Port 20000/TCP, referred to as "TCP Connection Hijacking".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable IOServer device (master station) and the ability to send crafted TCP packets. The attacker is described as needing moderate skill.
