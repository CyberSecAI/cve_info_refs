The provided content is related to CVE-2013-2226.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in three different scripts within GLPI (Gestionnaire libre de parc informatique) version 0.83.8. Specifically, the `users_id_assign` parameter in `/ajax/ticketassigninformation.php`, the `filename` parameter in `/front/document.form.php`, and the `table` parameter in `/ajax/comments.php` are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is error-based SQL injection. The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
* Exposure of system information: Attackers can retrieve sensitive database schema details, potentially revealing further vulnerabilities.
* Exposure of sensitive information: Attackers can read sensitive data stored in the database, such as user credentials or other confidential information.
* Manipulation of data: Attackers could alter or delete database records, leading to data corruption or loss.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are the POST parameters:
* `users_id_assign` in `/ajax/ticketassigninformation.php`
* `filename` in `/front/document.form.php`
* `table` in `/ajax/comments.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable GLPI application. The attacker does not require prior authentication or access privileges.
