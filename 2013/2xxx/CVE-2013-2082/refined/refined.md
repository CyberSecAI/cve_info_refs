Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the blog comment functionality of Moodle. Specifically, the system did not verify if a user had the necessary permissions to view a blog post before allowing them to view its comments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of an authorization check when viewing blog comments. This allowed users to bypass intended access controls.
- **Information Disclosure:** As a result, users who should not have had access to a blog post and its contents, could view comments made on that blog post.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially view comments on blog posts that they should not be able to access, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- **Privacy Breach:** The exploitation could lead to a privacy breach by revealing comments intended for a restricted audience.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access:** An attacker could directly attempt to access blog comments through the vulnerable endpoint without proper authorization.
- **Indirect Access:** An attacker might be able to discover direct links to comments through other means, and then access those links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Moodle User Account:** The attacker would need a valid user account on the affected Moodle platform.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Moodle platform over the network.

In summary, CVE-2013-2082 describes a serious permission issue in Moodle's blog comments functionality, where the lack of an authorization check allowed unauthorized users to view comments on blog posts they should not have access to. This could result in the unauthorized disclosure of information.
