{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the usage of httplib.HTTPSConnection in OpenStack components, which fails to validate server-side SSL certificates. This means that client connections are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper certificate validation when establishing HTTPS connections, specifically the lack of verification of server-side SSL certificates, which includes: checking if the certificate is signed by a CA I recognize, if the CA has revoked the certificate, and if the common name on the certificate matches the server being reached.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with access to network traffic between two endpoints relying on HTTPSConnection can trivially create a certificate that will be accepted as valid, allowing them to intercept, read, and modify traffic intended to be encrypted by SSL. This allows for potential spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attacks achieved by intercepting communication between OpenStack components that rely on HTTPS connections. This vulnerability affects communication between servers and can also affect client to server connections.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be positioned within the network to intercept traffic between the affected components that utilize HTTPS connections, with the ability to create a false certificate."
