| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-07-12 20:19:13 UTC  ``` From <https://secunia.com/advisories/54089/> :  Description  A security issue has been reported in various OpenStack products, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct spoofing attacks.  The security issue is caused due to the application not verifying the validity of the SSL certificates presented when connecting to the server. This can be exploited to spoof a valid server and e.g. conduct Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.  Please see the vendor's advisory for a list of affected products.   Solution: No official solution is currently available.  Original Advisory: OSSN: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1188189](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/%2Bbug/1188189) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2013-08-23 20:12:36 UTC  ``` From what I understand about this bug, it is a core python bug for python 2, and documented in [bug 480856](show_bug.cgi?id=480856 "RESOLVED FIXED - <dev-lang/python-{2.6.8-r3,2.7.5-r2,3.2.5-r2}: Hostname check bypassing vulnerability in SSL module (CVE-2013-4238)").  Would this bug be solved by running dev-lang/python-2.7.5-r2 or newer? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2013-09-11 17:57:12 UTC  ``` ya, this has been fixed in [bug 480856](show_bug.cgi?id=480856 "RESOLVED FIXED - <dev-lang/python-{2.6.8-r3,2.7.5-r2,3.2.5-r2}: Hostname check bypassing vulnerability in SSL module (CVE-2013-4238)")  This doesn't do anything on the m68k.  So, I'm removing myself from cc as this is fixed in the python update.  Feel free to readd if necessary. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-09-13 18:51:13 UTC  ``` Sorry, wrong bug.  Should be closed as noglsa? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-09-13 19:03:52 UTC  ``` Guess so. ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

### Bug Description

Grant Murphy from Red Hat reported usage of httplib.HTTPSConnection objects. In Python 2.x those do not perform CA checks so client connections are vulnerable to MiM attacks.

"""

The following files use httplib.HTTPSConnection :

keystone/middleware/s3\_token.py

keystone/middleware/ec2\_token.py

keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py

vendor/python-keystoneclient-master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth\_token.py

AFAICT HTTPSConnection does not validate server certificates and

should be avoided. This is fixed in Python 3, however in 2.X no

validation occurs. I suspect this is also applicable to most OpenStack

modules that make HTTPS client calls.

Similar problems were found in ovirt:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=851672> (CVE-2012-3533)

With solutions for ovirt:

Note: at first glance some calls seem to be used for test connections which are likely to be local and/or not contain any useful information. We need to carefully review the various cases before calling this a vulnerability.

So, for Keystone:

\* keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py is apparently used nowhere ?

\* keystone/middleware/{s3,ec2}\_token.py seem to use HTTPSConnection for a server-to-server request (in most cases connecting to the same host)

I suspect most of the others will be in the same case (servers making HTTPS connections to other local servers) so the MiM risk is limited. To give another data point, most Swift internal server-to-server communications are not even encrypted.

So for Swift:

swift.common.bufferedhttp has the capability to instantiate an https connection, but is not used directly in any of the swift code (this is likely due to the original swift client using it before it was pulled out). Internal services (for example from proxy -> object) communicate over plain http on a private network. So unless there is something else that I missed, I don't see a security vulnerability in swift.

For Cinder:

HTTPSConnection is used in Zadara driver to send commands to VPSA controller (if use\_ssl = True), as well as in the Solidfire driver to communicate with SolidFire devices.

./cinder/volume/drivers/zadara.py

./cinder/volume/drivers/solidfire.py

The third instance is in unit tests where it's not so much of a problem.

So all the occurences seem to be for serverside node-to-node communication that could be assumed to happen on private networks. That said, all those "use\_ssl" give a false sense of security (about the same as communicating unencrypted). The inability to specify a ca\_file should serve as a hint that it's not really safe, but that subtlety may be lost on most.

I'm not 100% certain to classify this as an exploitable vulnerability that warrants embargoed disclosure -- we could consider this as missing proper internal encryption features between internal nodes and remind people (through OSSN) to deploy over secure private management networks (as Swift already does). The only thing which makes this a potential vulnerability is that the "use\_ssl" parameters where available may induce people into thinking they are safe while they are not...

Thoughts ?

So all the occurences seem to be for serverside node-to-node communication that could be assumed to happen on private networks. That said, all those "use\_ssl" give a false sense of security (about the same as communicating unencrypted). The inability to specify a ca\_file should serve as a hint that it's not really safe, but that subtlety may be lost on most.

SSL/TLS capability likely still needs to remain available for compatibility with third-party systems, where administrators may be deploying canned configurations with all plaintext protocols disabled. I agree the short term fix is to disable any default unauthenticated encryption across the board, surround the config knobs for it with shouty disclaimers and possibly also log warning/info level messages when services are started running in this manner.

Long-term fix is of course to pathologically assume compromised/hostile internal networks, encrypt everywhere and perform peer validation using some pluggable mechanism (Kerberos, private CA, DNSSec+SSHFP, whatever) but I expect that's a very long way off.

Indeed... The SSL support in there is more to support the case where that other service is configured to only accept SSL client connections... not to really encrypt internal traffic.

I'm leaning towards issuing an OSSN about this, and fix it over time with additional features. Adding Rob Clark to the discussion.

@Dolph: now /that/ is a clear vulnerability. Client to server connections should always be properly encrypted. Could you open a separate (private security) bug about that ?

Well, generally keystoneclient.middleware.auth\_token will be deployed on an internal network, so I don't see it as being different from any other service-service communication identified here.

We need to move away from this pervasive assumption that private networks are secure. You only have to look at the 6 different hypervisor vulnerabilities released in the last 2ish months to understand that people are starting to come after virt tech in a big way and a full IaaS stack has a hell of an attack surface.

NSA, HP and a bunch of others all design their networks assuming some hostile actor is already inside and use various methods to try and contain an attacker. If an option to enable SSL is made available to deployers then it should provide most of the protections that you'd expect. Now we all know that SSL is actually quite the pain to configure correctly and perhaps there are areas we can help make life easier for deployers there too.

I vote for keeping this embargoed. OpenStack as-is offers SSL on some connections. Deployers who've turned on SSL for x,y,z connections will have done so to meet assurance requirements they've decided upon for their deployment. If this issue is disclosed without a fix it leaves deployers in a difficult position.

If you believe there's warrant for a wider OSSN on this issue I'd be happy to arrange for one to be drafted.

> We need to move away from this pervasive assumption that private networks are secure.

I can certainly relate to that. The question is, when does a missing important security feature become a vulnerability ?

Advertising encryption between components while not properly implementing it is definitely a vulnerability in my book (we issued OSSAs for that in the past, and have another in the pipe coming up). In the precise case of this bug it's slightly more blurry: "use\_ssl" parameters are more to allow servers to connect to other services that are configured to only accept SSL, than to "encrypt internal communications". I agree that it can still be seen as "advertising encryption while not properly encrypting" though... so I'm OK with embargo/OSSA on this.

The remaining question is how to fix this in stable branches ? We are not supposed to introduce new configuration parameters in stable branches. We also need to not break anyone on upgrade, and there is no good default value for ca\_file. Could we piggyback on a Python library that uses the local system cert store ?

Python libs in general seem pretty dire at using the default store, I think perhaps M2Crypto does, but that's really just wrapping OpenSSL anyway...

It's a perennial debate in the Python community, the most recent thread on the python-dev ML being <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2013-June/126671.html> . There's also an unassigned bug open for the past couple years ( <http://bugs.python.org/issue13655> ).

The python-nss module is LGPL and could be leveraged to access the builtin default NSS certdata... the real questions are around maturity and cross-platform support if you're wanting something which can leverage system-level cert databases and platform-specific trustdb management tools.

But by turning on certificate verification in existing deployments you're going to instabreak people who enabled HTTPS to talk to some random third-party device which has an expired, self-signed, CN-mismatched or otherwise nonconformant certificate on it because they saw there was a crypto option and decided to turn the knob all the way up without understanding the benefits (or lack thereof in this case).

So... It looks like something we can't "fix" as a simple security patch (as it would add a new feature and break on upgrade), but that we should definitely:

\* implement as a new feature in an upcoming version (the sooner the better)

\* document as unsafe in previous versions (OSSN ?)

Does that work for everyone ?

I agree that sounds like the most pragmatic approach. I don't see a reasonable way to "fix" this in stable releases without introducing new dependencies, adding config options, and potentially breaking existing production deployments. An OSSN and documentation improvements describing the actual intent for internal HTTPS support in these components seems like the only way to avoid having this embargoed more or less indefinitely.

Also, once the bug is an open/public hardening feature request it becomes much easier to pool the developer community to collectively solve instances of this much more quickly.

Some SSL-Enabled connections fail to perform basic certificate checks

----

### Summary ###

In many places OpenStack components use Python 2.x HTTPSConnection to establish an SSL connection between endpoints. This does not provide many of the assurances one would expect when using SSL and leaves connections open to potential man-in-the-middle attacks

### Affected Services / Software ###

keystone/middleware/s3\_token.py

keystone/middleware/ec2\_token.py

keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py

vendor/python-keystoneclient-master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth\_token.py

<<<<OTHERS NEED TO BE ADDED HERE>>>>>

### Discussion ###

A secure SSL session relies on validation of a X.509 certificate. Basic checks include:

\* Is the certificate signed by a CA I recognize

\* Has the CA revoked this certificate

\* Does the common name on the certificate match the server I'm trying to reach

The HTTPSConnection class is used in a large number of locations and fails to check that certificates are signed by a valid authority. Without that check in place, the following checks (some highlighted above) are largely invalid.

The result is that an attacker who has access to the network traffic between two endpoints relying on HTTPSConnection can trivially create a certificate that will be accepted by HTTPSConnection as valid - allowing the attacker to intercept, read and modify traffic that should be encrypted by SSL.

### Affected Services / Software ###
keystone/middleware/s3\_token.py
keystone/middleware/ec2\_token.py
keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py
vendor/python-keystoneclient-master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth\_token.py
### Discussion ###
A secure SSL session relies on validation of a X.509 certificate. Basic checks include:
\* Is the certificate signed by a CA I recognize
\* Has the CA revoked this certificate
\* Does the common name on the certificate match the server I'm trying to reach
The HTTPSConnection class is used in a large number of locations and fails to check that certificates are signed by a valid authority. Without that check in place, the following checks (some highlighted above) are largely invalid.
The result is that an attacker who has access to the network traffic between two endpoints relying on HTTPSConnection can trivially create a certificate that will be accepted by HTTPSConnection as valid - allowing the attacker to intercept, read and modify traffic that should be encrypted by SSL.
### Recommended Actions ###
Consider using an up to date version of the keystone client http://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/commit/20e166fd8a943ee3f91ba362a47e9c14c7cc5f4c

Some projects have updated their code to be more secure, others have not. The OSSG suggest cloud deployers check the status of bug [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1188189](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/%2Bbug/1188189) to see if the projects they require have updated.

So Daniel I have to say AWESOME job picking this up and running with it. I'm working on figuring out how to do this without breaking existing setups; although maybe somebody already has an idea off the top of their head.

I did want to clarify though, I think we need to make sure that everywhere this is proposed it doesn't break existing setups or upgrades. I'm not sure I was clear about that in the one version but it's going to be a critical piece of this. If we can automate the switch (which I think and hope we can) then at the very least we're going to need a very BOLD and EXPLICIT warning and instructions in the Release Notes and in the documents on how to keep from losing your cloud.

Random idea:

Maybe this is something which should be discussed/handled by the individual OpenStack distributors/vendors?

They could handle this inside their packages of cinder (or other components)? With pre-/post-scripts while upgrading the package?

All other automatic approaches were it disables SSL verification - or tolerates failing verification would let us end-up with the same security issue again - I guess.

I do not have a better idea either. But maybe we could use the Icehouse release and stress this fundamental change in Upgrade notes/instruction. And switch to SSL verification by default across all the identified OpenStack components.

Introducing some logic like: if the configured HTTPS URL holds an IP address instead of a DNS name, "very likely" SSL verification is not going to succeed so the code falls back to ssl\_insecure=True .... or something like that - I would not recommend to do. Since it would silently hide the fact that the current setup is not as secure as one would think.

Not quite sure if just logging that SSL verification failed and continuing with ssl\_insecure=True would "solve" it either in a correct fashion.

Maybe security- and release folks should decide to go once through this burden with the Icehouse release or not. And try to warn the admins ahead in Release Notes and Upgrade Instruction to verify if their setup would pass SSL verification - or not.

Replace httplib.HTTPSConnection in unittests

SSL Verification is from now on enabled by default for the

    TestOpenStackClient. So far no unittests was making actively use of

    httplib.HTTPSConnection.

Intention is to reduce noise of audits/scanners which look for Python 2.x

    httplib.HTTPSConnection missing SSL verification. By completely abandoning the use

    of httplib.HTTPSConnection.

    validation on the backend controller using SSH-style

    sticky authentication, individual trusted

    certificates, and/or certificate authorities.

    Also adds caching of connections to deal with

    increased overhead of TLS/SSL handshake.

Default is now sticky-style enforcement.

Replace HTTPSConnection in NEC plugin

Replace HTTPSConnection in NEC plugin PFC driver with Requests.

SSL Verification is from now on enabled by default.

This changes the default behaviour and is the primary intention of this

    change: verify SSL certificates.

This might break existing configuration/setups where the SSL certificate

    used by the NEC PFC driver would not pass the verification.

This is definitely still in nova in a few places. I kind of thing this should be an RC bug to actually clean up the rest of this.

So, for this to remain RC for nova I need a list of patches that need review. If we don't have that basically now, then we're going to need to drop this from rc1.

(That doesn't mean its important, just that I don't think we can hold rc1 waiting for it).

Now that the solidfire driver has switched from httplib to requests in the current development cycle (see <https://review.openstack.org/127399> for details) would it be possible to switch certificate validation on for it prior to the Kilo release, or do we need to wait for Liberty?

@Jeremy

I'll look at making the switch, frankly the overwhelming response I had received from the field was that is was a "don't care", that being said it's certainly a supported capability that I can adjust. Even if I make it an option that for now defaults to False I think it at least addresses the heart of the matter here.

While I agree that secure defaults are preferable, even if only to provide a good example to operators and prove that we as a project are doing all we can to keep them and their users safe, from what I've seen in the field most will be disinterested in running a CA or purchasing and tracking certificates for the various bits of hardware to which these drivers are communicating.

The additional complexity and liability of spontaneous breakage from certificate expiration often outweighs concerns over attacks by malicious entities infiltrating an isolated management network in ways which internal server-to-server and driver-to-hardware HTTPS might mitigate.

I appreciate the degree to which our developers already make security a priority in our software, and recognize that sometimes user demands for other fixes and features pragmatically outweigh some particular security improvements in the absence of specific developers focused on driving and implementing the latter.

Eek, I didn't realize that would be such a big wall of text.

It looks like this has been stagnant for a while and the requirements are pretty simple, so I am going to reassign this to myself and start working through the drivers that are using six.moves.http\_client and migrating them to requests instead.

I'm sorry to bail on this after grabbing it @d-gollub. I spent some time on this, but got stuck on updating tests. I reached out in a couple related tickets but got no replies. I'd hand this back but I don't have permission to do so.

It's been time since @killface007 had updated this.

Right now only QNAP Storage drivers use six.moves.http\_client's HTTPSConnection.

cinder/volume/drivers/qnap.py

    34 from six.moves import http\_client

   979 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(management\_ip,

   983 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(management\_ip,

   987 http\_client.HTTPConnection(management\_ip, management\_port))

  1006 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(nas\_ip,

  1010 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(

  1013 connection = http\_client.HTTPConnection(nas\_ip, self.port)

Rest of the files refer only HTTP codes, which I presume is safe.

### Bug Description

Grant Murphy from Red Hat reported usage of httplib.HTTPSConnection objects. In Python 2.x those do not perform CA checks so client connections are vulnerable to MiM attacks.

"""

The following files use httplib.HTTPSConnection :

keystone/middleware/s3\_token.py

keystone/middleware/ec2\_token.py

keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py

vendor/python-keystoneclient-master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth\_token.py

AFAICT HTTPSConnection does not validate server certificates and

should be avoided. This is fixed in Python 3, however in 2.X no

validation occurs. I suspect this is also applicable to most OpenStack

modules that make HTTPS client calls.

Similar problems were found in ovirt:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=851672> (CVE-2012-3533)

With solutions for ovirt:

<http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/7209/>

Note: at first glance some calls seem to be used for test connections which are likely to be local and/or not contain any useful information. We need to carefully review the various cases before calling this a vulnerability.

So, for Keystone:

\* keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py is apparently used nowhere ?

\* keystone/middleware/{s3,ec2}\_token.py seem to use HTTPSConnection for a server-to-server request (in most cases connecting to the same host)

I suspect most of the others will be in the same case (servers making HTTPS connections to other local servers) so the MiM risk is limited. To give another data point, most Swift internal server-to-server communications are not even encrypted.

So for Swift:

swift.common.bufferedhttp has the capability to instantiate an https connection, but is not used directly in any of the swift code (this is likely due to the original swift client using it before it was pulled out). Internal services (for example from proxy -> object) communicate over plain http on a private network. So unless there is something else that I missed, I don't see a security vulnerability in swift.

For Cinder:

HTTPSConnection is used in Zadara driver to send commands to VPSA controller (if use\_ssl = True), as well as in the Solidfire driver to communicate with SolidFire devices.

./cinder/volume/drivers/zadara.py

./cinder/volume/drivers/solidfire.py

So all the occurences seem to be for serverside node-to-node communication that could be assumed to happen on private networks. That said, all those "use\_ssl" give a false sense of security (about the same as communicating unencrypted). The inability to specify a ca\_file should serve as a hint that it's not really safe, but that subtlety may be lost on most.

I'm not 100% certain to classify this as an exploitable vulnerability that warrants embargoed disclosure -- we could consider this as missing proper internal encryption features between internal nodes and remind people (through OSSN) to deploy over secure private management networks (as Swift already does). The only thing which makes this a potential vulnerability is that the "use\_ssl" parameters where available may induce people into thinking they are safe while they are not...

Thoughts ?

SSL/TLS capability likely still needs to remain available for compatibility with third-party systems, where administrators may be deploying canned configurations with all plaintext protocols disabled. I agree the short term fix is to disable any default unauthenticated encryption across the board, surround the config knobs for it with shouty disclaimers and possibly also log warning/info level messages when services are started running in this manner.

Long-term fix is of course to pathologically assume compromised/hostile internal networks, encrypt everywhere and perform peer validation using some pluggable mechanism (Kerberos, private CA, DNSSec+SSHFP, whatever) but I expect that's a very long way off.

Indeed... The SSL support in there is more to support the case where that other service is configured to only accept SSL client connections... not to really encrypt internal traffic.

I'm leaning towards issuing an OSSN about this, and fix it over time with additional features. Adding Rob Clark to the discussion.

Well, generally keystoneclient.middleware.auth\_token will be deployed on an internal network, so I don't see it as being different from any other service-service communication identified here.

We need to move away from this pervasive assumption that private networks are secure. You only have to look at the 6 different hypervisor vulnerabilities released in the last 2ish months to understand that people are starting to come after virt tech in a big way and a full IaaS stack has a hell of an attack surface.

NSA, HP and a bunch of others all design their networks assuming some hostile actor is already inside and use various methods to try and contain an attacker. If an option to enable SSL is made available to deployers then it should provide most of the protections that you'd expect. Now we all know that SSL is actually quite the pain to configure correctly and perhaps there are areas we can help make life easier for deployers there too.

I vote for keeping this embargoed. OpenStack as-is offers SSL on some connections. Deployers who've turned on SSL for x,y,z connections will have done so to meet assurance requirements they've decided upon for their deployment. If this issue is disclosed without a fix it leaves deployers in a difficult position.

If you believe there's warrant for a wider OSSN on this issue I'd be happy to arrange for one to be drafted.

> We need to move away from this pervasive assumption that private networks are secure.

I can certainly relate to that. The question is, when does a missing important security feature become a vulnerability ?

Advertising encryption between components while not properly implementing it is definitely a vulnerability in my book (we issued OSSAs for that in the past, and have another in the pipe coming up). In the precise case of this bug it's slightly more blurry: "use\_ssl" parameters are more to allow servers to connect to other services that are configured to only accept SSL, than to "encrypt internal communications". I agree that it can still be seen as "advertising encryption while not properly encrypting" though... so I'm OK with embargo/OSSA on this.

The remaining question is how to fix this in stable branches ? We are not supposed to introduce new configuration parameters in stable branches. We also need to not break anyone on upgrade, and there is no good default value for ca\_file. Could we piggyback on a Python library that uses the local system cert store ?

Python libs in general seem pretty dire at using the default store, I think perhaps M2Crypto does, but that's really just wrapping OpenSSL anyway...

It's a perennial debate in the Python community, the most recent thread on the python-dev ML being <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2013-June/126671.html> . There's also an unassigned bug open for the past couple years ( <http://bugs.python.org/issue13655> ).

The python-nss module is LGPL and could be leveraged to access the builtin default NSS certdata... the real questions are around maturity and cross-platform support if you're wanting something which can leverage system-level cert databases and platform-specific trustdb management tools.

But by turning on certificate verification in existing deployments you're going to instabreak people who enabled HTTPS to talk to some random third-party device which has an expired, self-signed, CN-mismatched or otherwise nonconformant certificate on it because they saw there was a crypto option and decided to turn the knob all the way up without understanding the benefits (or lack thereof in this case).

So... It looks like something we can't "fix" as a simple security patch (as it would add a new feature and break on upgrade), but that we should definitely:

\* implement as a new feature in an upcoming version (the sooner the better)

\* document as unsafe in previous versions (OSSN ?)

Does that work for everyone ?

I agree that sounds like the most pragmatic approach. I don't see a reasonable way to "fix" this in stable releases without introducing new dependencies, adding config options, and potentially breaking existing production deployments. An OSSN and documentation improvements describing the actual intent for internal HTTPS support in these components seems like the only way to avoid having this embargoed more or less indefinitely.

Also, once the bug is an open/public hardening feature request it becomes much easier to pool the developer community to collectively solve instances of this much more quickly.

Some SSL-Enabled connections fail to perform basic certificate checks

----

### Summary ###

In many places OpenStack components use Python 2.x HTTPSConnection to establish an SSL connection between endpoints. This does not provide many of the assurances one would expect when using SSL and leaves connections open to potential man-in-the-middle attacks

### Affected Services / Software ###

keystone/middleware/s3\_token.py

keystone/middleware/ec2\_token.py

keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py

vendor/python-keystoneclient-master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth\_token.py

<<<<OTHERS NEED TO BE ADDED HERE>>>>>

### Discussion ###

A secure SSL session relies on validation of a X.509 certificate. Basic checks include:

\* Is the certificate signed by a CA I recognize

\* Has the CA revoked this certificate

\* Does the common name on the certificate match the server I'm trying to reach

The HTTPSConnection class is used in a large number of locations and fails to check that certificates are signed by a valid authority. Without that check in place, the following checks (some highlighted above) are largely invalid.

The result is that an attacker who has access to the network traffic between two endpoints relying on HTTPSConnection can trivially create a certificate that will be accepted by HTTPSConnection as valid - allowing the attacker to intercept, read and modify traffic that should be encrypted by SSL.

### Recommended Actions ###

Requests is becoming the standard way of doing http communication, it

    also vastly simplifies adding other authentication mechanisms. Use it in

    the auth\_token middleware.

This adds the ability to specify a CA file that will be used to verify a

    HTTPS connections or insecure to specifically ignore HTTPS validation.

Some SSL-Enabled connections fail to perform basic certificate checks

----

### Summary ###

In many places OpenStack components use Python 2.x HTTPSConnection to establish an SSL connection between endpoints. This does not provide many of the assurances one would expect when using SSL and leaves connections open to potential man-in-the-middle attacks

### Affected Services / Software ###

keystone/middleware/s3\_token.py

keystone/middleware/ec2\_token.py

keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py

vendor/python-keystoneclient-master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth\_token.py

### Discussion ###

A secure SSL session relies on validation of a X.509 certificate. Basic checks include:

\* Is the certificate signed by a CA I recognize

\* Has the CA revoked this certificate

\* Does the common name on the certificate match the server I'm trying to reach

The HTTPSConnection class is used in a large number of locations and fails to check that certificates are signed by a valid authority. Without that check in place, the following checks (some highlighted above) are largely invalid.

The result is that an attacker who has access to the network traffic between two endpoints relying on HTTPSConnection can trivially create a certificate that will be accepted by HTTPSConnection as valid - allowing the attacker to intercept, read and modify traffic that should be encrypted by SSL.

### Recommended Actions ###

Consider using an up to date version of the keystone client <http://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/commit/20e166fd8a943ee3f91ba362a47e9c14c7cc5f4c>

So Daniel I have to say AWESOME job picking this up and running with it. I'm working on figuring out how to do this without breaking existing setups; although maybe somebody already has an idea off the top of their head.

I did want to clarify though, I think we need to make sure that everywhere this is proposed it doesn't break existing setups or upgrades. I'm not sure I was clear about that in the one version but it's going to be a critical piece of this. If we can automate the switch (which I think and hope we can) then at the very least we're going to need a very BOLD and EXPLICIT warning and instructions in the Release Notes and in the documents on how to keep from losing your cloud.

Random idea:

Maybe this is something which should be discussed/handled by the individual OpenStack distributors/vendors?

They could handle this inside their packages of cinder (or other components)? With pre-/post-scripts while upgrading the package?

All other automatic approaches were it disables SSL verification - or tolerates failing verification would let us end-up with the same security issue again - I guess.

I do not have a better idea either. But maybe we could use the Icehouse release and stress this fundamental change in Upgrade notes/instruction. And switch to SSL verification by default across all the identified OpenStack components.

Introducing some logic like: if the configured HTTPS URL holds an IP address instead of a DNS name, "very likely" SSL verification is not going to succeed so the code falls back to ssl\_insecure=True .... or something like that - I would not recommend to do. Since it would silently hide the fact that the current setup is not as secure as one would think.

Not quite sure if just logging that SSL verification failed and continuing with ssl\_insecure=True would "solve" it either in a correct fashion.

Maybe security- and release folks should decide to go once through this burden with the Icehouse release or not. And try to warn the admins ahead in Release Notes and Upgrade Instruction to verify if their setup would pass SSL verification - or not.

Replace httplib.HTTPSConnection in unittests

SSL Verification is from now on enabled by default for the

    TestOpenStackClient. So far no unittests was making actively use of

    httplib.HTTPSConnection.

Intention is to reduce noise of audits/scanners which look for Python 2.x

    httplib.HTTPSConnection missing SSL verification. By completely abandoning the use

    of httplib.HTTPSConnection.

This patch adds the option to use SSL certificate

    validation on the backend controller using SSH-style

    sticky authentication, individual trusted

    certificates, and/or certificate authorities.

    Also adds caching of connections to deal with

    increased overhead of TLS/SSL handshake.

Default is now sticky-style enforcement.

commit 5bd4c2984d329625a2a8442b316fa235dbb88a3d

Author: Daniel Gollub <email address hidden>

Replace httplib.HTTPSConnection in ec2\_token

httplib.HTTPSConnection is known to not verify SSL certificates in Python 2.x.

    Implementation got adapted to make use of the requests module instead.

SSL Verification is from now on enabled by default.

Can be disabled via an additional introduced configuration option:

`keystone\_ec2\_insecure=True`

This changes the default behaviour and is the primary intention of this

This is definitely still in nova in a few places. I kind of thing this should be an RC bug to actually clean up the rest of this.

So, for this to remain RC for nova I need a list of patches that need review. If we don't have that basically now, then we're going to need to drop this from rc1.

(That doesn't mean its important, just that I don't think we can hold rc1 waiting for it).

Now that the solidfire driver has switched from httplib to requests in the current development cycle (see <https://review.openstack.org/127399> for details) would it be possible to switch certificate validation on for it prior to the Kilo release, or do we need to wait for Liberty?

@Jeremy

I'll look at making the switch, frankly the overwhelming response I had received from the field was that is was a "don't care", that being said it's certainly a supported capability that I can adjust. Even if I make it an option that for now defaults to False I think it at least addresses the heart of the matter here.

While I agree that secure defaults are preferable, even if only to provide a good example to operators and prove that we as a project are doing all we can to keep them and their users safe, from what I've seen in the field most will be disinterested in running a CA or purchasing and tracking certificates for the various bits of hardware to which these drivers are communicating.

The additional complexity and liability of spontaneous breakage from certificate expiration often outweighs concerns over attacks by malicious entities infiltrating an isolated management network in ways which internal server-to-server and driver-to-hardware HTTPS might mitigate.

I appreciate the degree to which our developers already make security a priority in our software, and recognize that sometimes user demands for other fixes and features pragmatically outweigh some particular security improvements in the absence of specific developers focused on driving and implementing the latter.

Eek, I didn't realize that would be such a big wall of text.

It looks like this has been stagnant for a while and the requirements are pretty simple, so I am going to reassign this to myself and start working through the drivers that are using six.moves.http\_client and migrating them to requests instead.

I'm sorry to bail on this after grabbing it @d-gollub. I spent some time on this, but got stuck on updating tests. I reached out in a couple related tickets but got no replies. I'd hand this back but I don't have permission to do so.

It's been time since @killface007 had updated this.

Right now only QNAP Storage drivers use six.moves.http\_client's HTTPSConnection.

cinder/volume/drivers/qnap.py

    34 from six.moves import http\_client

   979 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(management\_ip,

   983 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(management\_ip,

   987 http\_client.HTTPConnection(management\_ip, management\_port))

  1006 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(nas\_ip,

  1010 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(

  1013 connection = http\_client.HTTPConnection(nas\_ip, self.port)

Rest of the files refer only HTTP codes, which I presume is safe.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=829080#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2013-07-11 14:59:12 UTC  ``` public, via openstack  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1188189](https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/%2Bbug/1188189)  CVE-2013-2255  Grant Murphy from Red Hat reported usage of httplib.HTTPSConnection objects. In Python 2.x those do not perform CA checks so client connections are vulnerable to MiM attacks.

As an aside, the ovirt "solution's" only improvement seems to be that they check if the server cert is valid. They still don't check if it actually belongs to the host.  Upstream doesn't yet seem to have decided on any solution, but IMO it's best to move to the "requests" lib everywhere. It does cert validation and hostname checking.  For Cloud-1, it's the same issue, keystoneclient uses httplip.HTTPSConnection when auth_protocol is https (default), so it won't validate the (keystone) server cert nor if the cert matches the hostname. I would recommend backporting the upstream solution for Folsom once it's there.  About the impact: I don't want to play down the issue but if the keystone server is captured, the whole cloud is considered compromised anyway. The keystone server certs are owned by the (openstack-)keystone user (usually in /etc/keystone/ssl...), but an attacker wouldn't waste time replacing SSL certs, he already owns all (user/admin) tokens anyway. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=829080#c6)  Alexander Bergmann   2013-09-20 09:50:18 UTC  ``` The following was suggested over the OpenStack Security ML:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1188189/comments/32](https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/%2Bbug/1188189/comments/32)  ... ### Recommended Actions ### Consider using an up to date version of the keystone client <http://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/commit/20e166fd8a943ee3f91ba362a47e9c14c7cc5f4c> ...

### Bug Description

Grant Murphy from Red Hat reported usage of httplib.HTTPSConnection objects. In Python 2.x those do not perform CA checks so client connections are vulnerable to MiM attacks.

"""

The following files use httplib.HTTPSConnection :

keystone/middleware/s3\_token.py

keystone/middleware/ec2\_token.py

keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py

vendor/python-keystoneclient-master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth\_token.py

AFAICT HTTPSConnection does not validate server certificates and

should be avoided. This is fixed in Python 3, however in 2.X no

validation occurs. I suspect this is also applicable to most OpenStack

modules that make HTTPS client calls.

Similar problems were found in ovirt:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=851672> (CVE-2012-3533)

Note: at first glance some calls seem to be used for test connections which are likely to be local and/or not contain any useful information. We need to carefully review the various cases before calling this a vulnerability.

So, for Keystone:

\* keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py is apparently used nowhere ?

\* keystone/middleware/{s3,ec2}\_token.py seem to use HTTPSConnection for a server-to-server request (in most cases connecting to the same host)

I suspect most of the others will be in the same case (servers making HTTPS connections to other local servers) so the MiM risk is limited. To give another data point, most Swift internal server-to-server communications are not even encrypted.

So for Swift:

swift.common.bufferedhttp has the capability to instantiate an https connection, but is not used directly in any of the swift code (this is likely due to the original swift client using it before it was pulled out). Internal services (for example from proxy -> object) communicate over plain http on a private network. So unless there is something else that I missed, I don't see a security vulnerability in swift.

For Cinder:

HTTPSConnection is used in Zadara driver to send commands to VPSA controller (if use\_ssl = True), as well as in the Solidfire driver to communicate with SolidFire devices.

./cinder/volume/drivers/zadara.py

./cinder/volume/drivers/solidfire.py

The third instance is in unit tests where it's not so much of a problem.

So all the occurences seem to be for serverside node-to-node communication that could be assumed to happen on private networks. That said, all those "use\_ssl" give a false sense of security (about the same as communicating unencrypted). The inability to specify a ca\_file should serve as a hint that it's not really safe, but that subtlety may be lost on most.

I'm not 100% certain to classify this as an exploitable vulnerability that warrants embargoed disclosure -- we could consider this as missing proper internal encryption features between internal nodes and remind people (through OSSN) to deploy over secure private management networks (as Swift already does). The only thing which makes this a potential vulnerability is that the "use\_ssl" parameters where available may induce people into thinking they are safe while they are not...

Thoughts ?

SSL/TLS capability likely still needs to remain available for compatibility with third-party systems, where administrators may be deploying canned configurations with all plaintext protocols disabled. I agree the short term fix is to disable any default unauthenticated encryption across the board, surround the config knobs for it with shouty disclaimers and possibly also log warning/info level messages when services are started running in this manner.

Long-term fix is of course to pathologically assume compromised/hostile internal networks, encrypt everywhere and perform peer validation using some pluggable mechanism (Kerberos, private CA, DNSSec+SSHFP, whatever) but I expect that's a very long way off.

Indeed... The SSL support in there is more to support the case where that other service is configured to only accept SSL client connections... not to really encrypt internal traffic.

I'm leaning towards issuing an OSSN about this, and fix it over time with additional features. Adding Rob Clark to the discussion.

@Dolph: now /that/ is a clear vulnerability. Client to server connections should always be properly encrypted. Could you open a separate (private security) bug about that ?

Well, generally keystoneclient.middleware.auth\_token will be deployed on an internal network, so I don't see it as being different from any other service-service communication identified here.

We need to move away from this pervasive assumption that private networks are secure. You only have to look at the 6 different hypervisor vulnerabilities released in the last 2ish months to understand that people are starting to come after virt tech in a big way and a full IaaS stack has a hell of an attack surface.

NSA, HP and a bunch of others all design their networks assuming some hostile actor is already inside and use various methods to try and contain an attacker. If an option to enable SSL is made available to deployers then it should provide most of the protections that you'd expect. Now we all know that SSL is actually quite the pain to configure correctly and perhaps there are areas we can help make life easier for deployers there too.

I vote for keeping this embargoed. OpenStack as-is offers SSL on some connections. Deployers who've turned on SSL for x,y,z connections will have done so to meet assurance requirements they've decided upon for their deployment. If this issue is disclosed without a fix it leaves deployers in a difficult position.

If you believe there's warrant for a wider OSSN on this issue I'd be happy to arrange for one to be drafted.

We need to move away from this pervasive assumption that private networks are secure. You only have to look at the 6 different hypervisor vulnerabilities released in the last 2ish months to understand that people are starting to come after virt tech in a big way and a full IaaS stack has a hell of an attack surface.
NSA, HP and a bunch of others all design their networks assuming some hostile actor is already inside and use various methods to try and contain an attacker. If an option to enable SSL is made available to deployers then it should provide most of the protections that you'd expect. Now we all know that SSL is actually quite the pain to configure correctly and perhaps there are areas we can help make life easier for deployers there too.

> We need to move away from this pervasive assumption that private networks are secure.

I can certainly relate to that. The question is, when does a missing important security feature become a vulnerability ?

Advertising encryption between components while not properly implementing it is definitely a vulnerability in my book (we issued OSSAs for that in the past, and have another in the pipe coming up). In the precise case of this bug it's slightly more blurry: "use\_ssl" parameters are more to allow servers to connect to other services that are configured to only accept SSL, than to "encrypt internal communications". I agree that it can still be seen as "advertising encryption while not properly encrypting" though... so I'm OK with embargo/OSSA on this.

The remaining question is how to fix this in stable branches ? We are not supposed to introduce new configuration parameters in stable branches. We also need to not break anyone on upgrade, and there is no good default value for ca\_file. Could we piggyback on a Python library that uses the local system cert store ?

Python libs in general seem pretty dire at using the default store, I think perhaps M2Crypto does, but that's really just wrapping OpenSSL anyway...

It's a perennial debate in the Python community, the most recent thread on the python-dev ML being <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2013-June/126671.html> . There's also an unassigned bug open for the past couple years ( <http://bugs.python.org/issue13655> ).

The python-nss module is LGPL and could be leveraged to access the builtin default NSS certdata... the real questions are around maturity and cross-platform support if you're wanting something which can leverage system-level cert databases and platform-specific trustdb management tools.

But by turning on certificate verification in existing deployments you're going to instabreak people who enabled HTTPS to talk to some random third-party device which has an expired, self-signed, CN-mismatched or otherwise nonconformant certificate on it because they saw there was a crypto option and decided to turn the knob all the way up without understanding the benefits (or lack thereof in this case).

So... It looks like something we can't "fix" as a simple security patch (as it would add a new feature and break on upgrade), but that we should definitely:

\* implement as a new feature in an upcoming version (the sooner the better)

\* document as unsafe in previous versions (OSSN ?)

Does that work for everyone ?

I agree that sounds like the most pragmatic approach. I don't see a reasonable way to "fix" this in stable releases without introducing new dependencies, adding config options, and potentially breaking existing production deployments. An OSSN and documentation improvements describing the actual intent for internal HTTPS support in these components seems like the only way to avoid having this embargoed more or less indefinitely.

Also, once the bug is an open/public hardening feature request it becomes much easier to pool the developer community to collectively solve instances of this much more quickly.

Some SSL-Enabled connections fail to perform basic certificate checks

----

### Summary ###

In many places OpenStack components use Python 2.x HTTPSConnection to establish an SSL connection between endpoints. This does not provide many of the assurances one would expect when using SSL and leaves connections open to potential man-in-the-middle attacks

### Affected Services / Software ###

keystone/middleware/s3\_token.py

keystone/middleware/ec2\_token.py

keystone/common/bufferedhttp.py

vendor/python-keystoneclient-master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth\_token.py

<<<<OTHERS NEED TO BE ADDED HERE>>>>>

### Discussion ###

A secure SSL session relies on validation of a X.509 certificate. Basic checks include:

\* Is the certificate signed by a CA I recognize

\* Has the CA revoked this certificate

\* Does the common name on the certificate match the server I'm trying to reach

The HTTPSConnection class is used in a large number of locations and fails to check that certificates are signed by a valid authority. Without that check in place, the following checks (some highlighted above) are largely invalid.

The result is that an attacker who has access to the network traffic between two endpoints relying on HTTPSConnection can trivially create a certificate that will be accepted by HTTPSConnection as valid - allowing the attacker to intercept, read and modify traffic that should be encrypted by SSL.

### Recommended Actions ###

So Daniel I have to say AWESOME job picking this up and running with it. I'm working on figuring out how to do this without breaking existing setups; although maybe somebody already has an idea off the top of their head.

I did want to clarify though, I think we need to make sure that everywhere this is proposed it doesn't break existing setups or upgrades. I'm not sure I was clear about that in the one version but it's going to be a critical piece of this. If we can automate the switch (which I think and hope we can) then at the very least we're going to need a very BOLD and EXPLICIT warning and instructions in the Release Notes and in the documents on how to keep from losing your cloud.

Random idea:

Maybe this is something which should be discussed/handled by the individual OpenStack distributors/vendors?

They could handle this inside their packages of cinder (or other components)? With pre-/post-scripts while upgrading the package?

All other automatic approaches were it disables SSL verification - or tolerates failing verification would let us end-up with the same security issue again - I guess.

I do not have a better idea either. But maybe we could use the Icehouse release and stress this fundamental change in Upgrade notes/instruction. And switch to SSL verification by default across all the identified OpenStack components.

Introducing some logic like: if the configured HTTPS URL holds an IP address instead of a DNS name, "very likely" SSL verification is not going to succeed so the code falls back to ssl\_insecure=True .... or something like that - I would not recommend to do. Since it would silently hide the fact that the current setup is not as secure as one would think.

Not quite sure if just logging that SSL verification failed and continuing with ssl\_insecure=True would "solve" it either in a correct fashion.

Maybe security- and release folks should decide to go once through this burden with the Icehouse release or not. And try to warn the admins ahead in Release Notes and Upgrade Instruction to verify if their setup would pass SSL verification - or not.

Replace httplib.HTTPSConnection in unittests

SSL Verification is from now on enabled by default for the

    TestOpenStackClient. So far no unittests was making actively use of

    httplib.HTTPSConnection.

Intention is to reduce noise of audits/scanners which look for Python 2.x

    httplib.HTTPSConnection missing SSL verification. By completely abandoning the use

    of httplib.HTTPSConnection.

BigSwitch: Add SSL Certificate Validation

This patch adds the option to use SSL certificate

    validation on the backend controller using SSH-style

    sticky authentication, individual trusted

    certificates, and/or certificate authorities.

    Also adds caching of connections to deal with

    increased overhead of TLS/SSL handshake.

Default is now sticky-style enforcement.

This is definitely still in nova in a few places. I kind of thing this should be an RC bug to actually clean up the rest of this.

Sean, I agree. Here's one that's almost through gerrit after \*only\* seven months of review for a tiny change.

So, for this to remain RC for nova I need a list of patches that need review. If we don't have that basically now, then we're going to need to drop this from rc1.

(That doesn't mean its important, just that I don't think we can hold rc1 waiting for it).

Now that the solidfire driver has switched from httplib to requests in the current development cycle (see <https://review.openstack.org/127399> for details) would it be possible to switch certificate validation on for it prior to the Kilo release, or do we need to wait for Liberty?

@Jeremy

I'll look at making the switch, frankly the overwhelming response I had received from the field was that is was a "don't care", that being said it's certainly a supported capability that I can adjust. Even if I make it an option that for now defaults to False I think it at least addresses the heart of the matter here.

While I agree that secure defaults are preferable, even if only to provide a good example to operators and prove that we as a project are doing all we can to keep them and their users safe, from what I've seen in the field most will be disinterested in running a CA or purchasing and tracking certificates for the various bits of hardware to which these drivers are communicating.

The additional complexity and liability of spontaneous breakage from certificate expiration often outweighs concerns over attacks by malicious entities infiltrating an isolated management network in ways which internal server-to-server and driver-to-hardware HTTPS might mitigate.

I appreciate the degree to which our developers already make security a priority in our software, and recognize that sometimes user demands for other fixes and features pragmatically outweigh some particular security improvements in the absence of specific developers focused on driving and implementing the latter.

In Cinder, the following drivers are using six.moves.http\_client, which on python 2.7 I believe calls httplib:

Eek, I didn't realize that would be such a big wall of text.

It looks like this has been stagnant for a while and the requirements are pretty simple, so I am going to reassign this to myself and start working through the drivers that are using six.moves.http\_client and migrating them to requests instead.

It's been time since @killface007 had updated this.

Right now only QNAP Storage drivers use six.moves.http\_client's HTTPSConnection.

cinder/volume/drivers/qnap.py

    34 from six.moves import http\_client

   979 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(management\_ip,

   983 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(management\_ip,

   987 http\_client.HTTPConnection(management\_ip, management\_port))

  1006 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(nas\_ip,

  1010 connection = http\_client.HTTPSConnection(

  1013 connection = http\_client.HTTPConnection(nas\_ip, self.port)

Rest of the files refer only HTTP codes, which I presume is safe.

## Notes

---

### [jdstrand](https://launchpad.net/~jdstrand)

swift not-affected per upstream
per upstream, all occurences are "for serverside node-to-node
communication that could be assumed to happen on private networks". 'use\_ssl'
does convey protection, but there is no way to specify a ca\_file. Adjusting
priority to low since client to server communications are not affected (just
server to server and middleware to server) and upstream and Ubuntu
documentation all state the OpenStack components should be on a trusted
network segment
uses httplib.HTTPSConnection objects which are not fixed in Ubuntu.
Could use pycurl, python3, or httplib2.
upstream will fix as a secure feature in a future version because
this will break upgrades. Nothing to be done at this time. Leaving 13.10
open, but deferred, since the 13.10 will have a newer version.
Ubuntu 13.10 released before fix from upstream, ignoring keystone
Ubuntu 13.10 released with python-keystoneclient 0.3, ignoring
Ubuntu 13.10 released before fix from upstream, ignoring cinder
Ubuntu 13.10 released before fix from upstream, ignoring nova
