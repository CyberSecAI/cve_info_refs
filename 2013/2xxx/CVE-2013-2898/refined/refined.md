Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2898:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `sensor_hub_get_feature` function in the `drivers/hid/hid-sensor-hub.c` file of the Linux kernel's HID subsystem.
- A lack of proper bounds checking when accessing fields of a HID report allows for out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Past-end-of-heap-allocation read**: A malicious HID device can send a crafted feature report that causes the `sensor_hub_get_feature` function to read beyond the allocated heap memory for the report.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Leak**: Reading past the end of the heap allocation can leak kernel memory contents to the caller (potentially userspace). This leaked information might contain sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Physically proximate attacker**: An attacker needs to be able to connect a malicious HID device to the target machine.
- **Specially crafted HID device/report**: The attacker needs to send a feature report designed to trigger the out-of-bounds read in the `sensor_hub_get_feature` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the target system to connect the malicious HID device.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to craft a malicious HID feature report.
- The system must have the `CONFIG_HID_SENSOR_HUB` option enabled in its kernel configuration.
