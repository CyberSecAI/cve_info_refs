**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the browser handles the "204 No Content" HTTP status code, leading to an address bar spoofing issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The core vulnerability is **address bar spoofing**. The browser's display of the URL is manipulated by exploiting the "204 No Content" status code, potentially tricking users into believing they are on a legitimate site when they are not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
*   **Deceive users:** The attacker can make a malicious site appear as a legitimate one, increasing the chances of the user interacting with it, such as entering sensitive information.
*   **Phishing:** The spoofed address bar can be used to create convincing phishing attacks, where users are tricked into submitting credentials or other sensitive data on a fake website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through a malicious website sending a specific "204 No Content" HTTP status code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host or control a malicious website.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious website via a means the victim uses, such as a link.
