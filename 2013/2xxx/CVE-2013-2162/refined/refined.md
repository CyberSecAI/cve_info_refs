Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

-   A race condition exists in the `mysql-server-5.5` post-installation script (`mysql-server-5.5.postinst`). The script creates the `/etc/mysql/debian.cnf` configuration file with world-readable permissions before restricting them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability lies in the time gap between the creation of the file with default (world-readable) permissions and the subsequent restriction of those permissions.
-   **Insecure File Creation:** The post-installation script creates the `/etc/mysql/debian.cnf` file, which contains the plain text credentials for the `debian-sys-maint` MySQL user, with insecure default permissions (644) before changing them to 600.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** A local, non-privileged user can exploit the race condition and read the `/etc/mysql/debian.cnf` file during the brief period when it has world-readable permissions.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining the `debian-sys-maint` user's credentials, an attacker can perform administrative tasks on the MySQL server.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system where MySQL Server 5.5 is being installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Non-privileged Local User:**  The attacker needs to be a non-privileged local user on the affected system.
-   **Timing:** The attacker must be able to access the file during the race condition window between file creation and permission restriction, which can be exploited by opening a file descriptor to the file when the permissions are world-readable.
