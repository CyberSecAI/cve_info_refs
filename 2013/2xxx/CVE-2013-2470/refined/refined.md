Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2470:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents directly mention CVE-2013-2470 in the context of security updates for Java.  Specifically, the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2013:1060 and SUSE security update SUSE-SU-2013:1257-1 explicitly list CVE-2013-2470 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed. The Red Hat Bugzilla entry Bug 975099 is also specifically for CVE-2013-2470, and the description of the vulnerability matches what is expected based on the CVE description. This confirms that the provided content is relevant to CVE-2013-2470.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from incorrect processing of byte lookups within the ImagingLib of the 2D component in OpenJDK/Java. Specifically, the `IntegerComponentRaster` class did not properly verify that the data buffer size fits the raster attributes.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Improper bounds checking/verification of the data buffer size against raster attributes in `IntegerComponentRaster`
    *   Incorrect processing of byte lookups
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Sandbox Bypass:** An untrusted Java applet or application could potentially bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
    *  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the improperly handled byte lookup, it's possible for an attacker to trigger a memory corruption within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution within the JVM's context.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A malicious or untrusted Java applet or application
    *  The vulnerability is triggered by incorrect processing of byte lookups in the imaging library.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would need to be able to execute malicious Java code, either through a specially crafted application or by tricking a user into running an untrusted applet.
    *   A user with a vulnerable JRE/JDK.
    *   No special network position is required
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The `IntegerComponentRaster` class was specifically mentioned in the bugzilla and Red Hat advisories.
    * The `ImagingLib` and the 2D component were mentioned as the vulnerable components in openSUSE mailing lists.
    *   The resolution involved fixing how the data buffer size is checked against raster attributes in `IntegerComponentRaster` and fixing the `ImagingLib` and 2D component.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information includes links to external resources, such as the Oracle and IBM security pages, as well as mailing list discussions and bug reports from Red Hat.
*   The updates are described as "important" or "critical," highlighting the potential risk associated with this vulnerability.
* The fixes are part of a larger set of fixes bundled in the respective vendors' security updates.
*   The fixes address multiple other vulnerabilities in addition to CVE-2013-2470.
*   The vulnerability also affected `java-1.5.0-ibm` and `java-1.6.0-ibm`.
*   The fix also includes changes to access restrictions in several modules, including Sound, AWT, CORBA, JDBC, JMX and Libraries.

In summary, CVE-2013-2470 is a significant vulnerability related to byte lookup processing within Java's 2D imaging library. It could allow an attacker to bypass sandbox restrictions or cause a denial of service, with the potential to achieve arbitrary code execution. The fixes involved corrections of the buffer size validation in `IntegerComponentRaster` and other related components within Java libraries, all aiming to prevent the incorrect byte lookups and memory corruption.
