Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-2901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an integer overflow issue within ANGLE (Almost Native Graphics Layer). This means a calculation involving an integer variable exceeded its maximum value, wrapping around to a small or negative value and causing incorrect processing in memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** Specifically, the integer overflow occurs in the handling of triangle fans and line loops in ANGLE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided information does not specify the exact impact. However, integer overflows in graphics libraries can potentially lead to memory corruption, which in turn can cause application crashes or enable arbitrary code execution. 
*   The severity of this issue is marked as High in the Chrome release notes and Debian security advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the processing of graphics data, specifically triangle fans and line loops. An attacker would need to be able to influence the parameters used in those rendering processes. This could potentially be achieved by crafting malicious web content that utilizes WebGL or other graphics rendering features, causing ANGLE to perform an overflowing calculation.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during graphics rendering, implying that exploitation is possible through the browser rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the parameters of graphics rendering within the browser's context
*   The attacker would likely need to craft a web page or other form of content that uses WebGL to trigger the integer overflow.

**Additional Details**

*   The fix was applied in ANGLE commit `c7de4feb6b7f98bc9939238283f3a43ad6653901` which involved changes to `src/common/version.h`, `src/libGLESv2/renderer/Renderer11.cpp`, and `src/libGLESv2/renderer/Renderer9.cpp`.
*   The fix includes a check for underflow as well as overflow issues
