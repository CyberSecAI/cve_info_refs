Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Moodle Gradebook's Overview report calculates and displays grade totals. Specifically, the method used to determine whether to include hidden grades in the totals (`showtotalsifcontainhidden`) was flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** The Gradebook's Overview report could inadvertently display grade totals that included hidden grades. This would expose information that was intended to be concealed from users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Minor Information Exposure:** The primary impact was the potential exposure of hidden grade information. This could lead to students or other users seeing grade totals that they should not have access to, potentially creating confusion or distrust in the grading system. The severity of the risk is considered minor.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Accessing the Gradebook Overview Report:** The vulnerability was triggered by simply accessing the Gradebook's Overview report, which is a standard feature of the Moodle platform. No specific malicious user actions are required beyond normal report access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker would need to be an authenticated user with the ability to access the Gradebook and its Overview report. This would typically include students, teachers, and administrators. No special privileges are required beyond basic access to the relevant gradebook reports.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected versions of Moodle include 2.4 to 2.4.3, 2.3 to 2.3.6, and earlier unsupported versions.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Moodle versions 2.5, 2.4.4 and 2.3.7.
- A workaround was to ensure all courses have the same value for the setting that controls the hiding of grades in the gradebook (Administration > Grades > Course grade settings > Hide totals if they contain hidden items).
