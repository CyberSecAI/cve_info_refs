Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-2678:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a file path traversal vulnerability in the Cisco Linksys E4200 wireless router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory. This is achieved through the `next_page` parameter in a specific POST request to `/storage/apply.cgi`. Specifically, the `next_page` parameter is vulnerable and allows directory traversal via `../../` sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially read sensitive system files, such as `/etc/passwd`, by manipulating the `next_page` parameter. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to `/storage/apply.cgi`, with a modified `next_page` parameter, including directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router's web interface. The attacker does not need prior authentication, as the vulnerability exists in the web interface component that processes the request.
