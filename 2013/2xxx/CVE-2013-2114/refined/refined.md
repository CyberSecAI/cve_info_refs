Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2114:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content directly references CVE-2013-2114 and describes a vulnerability in MediaWiki related to chunked uploads, which aligns with the CVE description.
*   The provided bugzilla link (T50306) is about the same issue with chunked uploads in MediaWiki, and it is confirmed to be related to CVE-2013-2114 in the comment section of the bugzilla page.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is that MediaWiki's API for handling chunked uploads, as well as asynchronous uploads, did not properly perform security checks on the uploaded file chunks. Specifically, the `verifyUpload()` function was not being called during chunked uploads, and during async uploads.
*   The vulnerability is present when uploading files in chunks via the API or with asynchronous uploads enabled.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when using the API action=upload with chunked uploads, which allows bypassing the file verification checks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate File Verification:**  The primary weakness is the lack of proper file verification during chunked and asynchronous uploads. The server was not verifying file types, allowing the upload of arbitrary content with incorrect file extensions.
*    **Missing Mime-Type Checks:** Specifically, the code path for chunked/async uploads was missing a step that compared the detected MIME type of the uploaded file with its extension.
*   **Temp Directory Exposure:** The temporary directory used to store chunks of uploaded files was publicly accessible by default in MediaWiki. Combined with missing mime type verifications, this allows an attacker to upload a malicious file, such as an HTML file in chunks, and have a publicly accessible URL to this file on the same server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** An attacker could potentially upload and execute malicious code if the server's configuration allows it (e.g. php files, or other executable formats).
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to upload arbitrary file types (e.g. html files) can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. This could allow the attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page and compromise other users.
*   **Bypass Security Checks:** Attackers could bypass file type restrictions implemented by the system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The temporary files were publicly accessible, which, while not a primary vulnerability, could disclose potentially sensitive information if the temporary files contain any.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The ability to upload files without proper checks could allow for the upload of large files that could exhaust server resources.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Chunked Uploads:** An attacker can use the chunked upload functionality of the MediaWiki API to upload files in pieces, bypassing the security checks that are only triggered on the final combined file.
*   **Asynchronous Uploads:** The vulnerability also applies when the async parameter is set to 1 during upload, even for non-chunked uploads.
*   **API Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the MediaWiki API's `action=upload` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to a MediaWiki instance.
*   **Upload Permissions:** The attacker would require the ability to upload files to the MediaWiki installation, which is normally limited to registered users with upload permissions.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the MediaWiki API and how to perform chunked or async uploads.
*   **Ability to craft malicious files**: Attackers need to be able to create malicious files with specific extensions to bypass MIME type checks when uploading.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in MediaWiki versions 1.19 and 1.20, and likely prior versions.
*   Patches were released to address the vulnerability in MediaWiki versions 1.19.7 and 1.20.6, which are the versions that should be upgraded to.
*   The patches address the vulnerability by properly verifying the file type during chunked/async uploads, ensuring all chunks conform with what is expected.
*   An attempt to disable chunked uploads by default was made, but was ultimately abandoned.

In summary, CVE-2013-2114 refers to a critical vulnerability in MediaWiki that allows attackers to bypass file verification checks during chunked or asynchronous uploads, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, XSS, or information disclosure. The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 1.19.7 and 1.20.6 and was addressed by the implementation of proper file type verification.
