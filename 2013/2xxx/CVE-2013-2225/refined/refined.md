Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of the `unserialize()` function in multiple places within the GLPI codebase. Specifically, user-supplied data passed through the `_predefined_fields` parameter in the `ticket.form.php` script is being unserialized without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **PHP Object Injection/Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502):** The core issue is that the `unserialize()` function in PHP can be exploited if it processes untrusted, serialized data. When a serialized object is unserialized, PHP might execute the object's `__wakeup()` and `__destruct()` magic methods, which an attacker can manipulate to achieve code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious serialized PHP objects, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code in the context of the vulnerable GLPI application. This can lead to a full compromise of the application and the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `ticket.form.php` script, including a serialized PHP object in the `_predefined_fields` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable GLPI server to send the malicious HTTP request.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Based on the provided information, it seems that no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `ticket.class.php`, within the `showFormHelpdesk` function.
*   The attack involves providing a crafted serialized PHP object via the `_predefined_fields` parameter.
*   The `stripslashes` and `rawurldecode` functions are applied before passing the data to `unserialize`.
*   The vulnerability is present in GLPI version 0.83.9.
*   The fix involved modifying the code to avoid using `unserialize()` with untrusted data in commits 21169 to 21180.
