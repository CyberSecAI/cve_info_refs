Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2233:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The default configuration of Ansible, when using the `paramiko_ssh` connection plugin, did not cache SSH host keys. This effectively disabled host key checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Host Key Verification:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of SSH host key verification in Ansible's default setup when using the `paramiko_ssh` plugin. Paramiko's `AutoAddPolicy` was hardcoded, which automatically accepts any host key, making it vulnerable to Man-in-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.
- **No Caching Mechanism:** Ansible was not loading or saving host keys by default, so there was no mechanism to verify the identity of remote hosts when establishing SSH connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **MITM Attacks:** An attacker could intercept the initial SSH connection, present a fake host key, and perform a man-in-the-middle attack. This would allow the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to systems being managed by Ansible, or intercept and manipulate data in transit.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exposed when Ansible establishes an SSH connection using `paramiko_ssh` connection plugin to a target system. An attacker would need to be positioned in the network to intercept the connection between the Ansible control machine and the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the Ansible control machine and the target systems. This could be achieved by being on the same network segment or by compromising a network device along the path.
- **Interception of Connection:** The attacker would need to be able to intercept the SSH connection attempt.
- **Spoofing of Host Key:** The attacker would need to be able to present a spoofed SSH host key to the Ansible control machine during the initial handshake.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was initially reported and rejected on GitHub.
- The fix involves calling `ssh.load_system_host_keys()` within the `paramiko_ssh.py` connection plugin, which loads known host keys.
- The vulnerability affected Ansible versions shipped with Fedora 17, 18, 19 and EPEL-6.
- Patched versions for Fedora 17,18,19 and EPEL-6 are `ansible-1.2.2-1.fc17`, `ansible-1.2.2-1.fc18`, `ansible-1.2.2-1.fc19`, and `ansible-1.2.2-1.el6` respectively.
