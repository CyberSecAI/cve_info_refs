So the thing is it can be completely random, just like a coin flip.
But the search space might be to small (e.g. a 1 bit key based on a
coin flip wouldn't be "secure"). I suspect 2^32 isn't enough any more
either, assuming a 480 core GPU, if you can run 250 cracking attempts
per second per core you can brute force a 2^32 search space in 10
hours or so. Needless to say GPUs are getting pretty cheap. So this
appears to be a textbook example of CWE-334 "Small Space of Random
Values".

Please use CVE-2013-2213 for KDE KRandom::random() CWE-334: Small
Space of Random Values.

Subject: Re: KDE Paste Applet

Ok, so the fix for this uses KRandom::random()...

I suggest leaving the KDE Paste fix as-is and replacing KRandom with
something that just fills an integer from /dev/urandom - then we can save a
few CVE numbers for the rest of the year.

qrand() should probably also do the same, especially since cnonces for HTTP
auth are using it - that means there's only 2^32 (at best) possible
cnonces...

  Michael

Sidhpurwala    2013-07-08 03:24:46 UTC  ``` The KRandom::random() function is written using the glibc srand()/rand() functions.   kdecore/util/krandom.cpp:       39       int fd = KDE_open("/dev/urandom", O_RDONLY);      40       if (fd < 0 || ::read(fd, &seed, sizeof(seed)) != sizeof(seed))      41       {      42             // No /dev/urandom... try something else.      43             srand(getpid());      44             seed = rand()+time(0);      45       }      46       if (fd >= 0) close(fd);      47       srand(seed);      48    }      49    return rand();  Krandom::random() tries to read the seed from /dev/urandom. If it is not able to open /dev/urandom, it uses a combination of the pid and system time to derive a seed (more predictable then /dev/urandom ofcourse). This seed is then used to derive random numbers via the glibc, rand() function.  Note: glibc's rand() function is based on Linear congruential generator and is not recommended to be used for cryptographic purposes which includes generation of random passwords/keys for desktop applications.  The same applies to other pseudo-random number generator functions like KRandom::random() which are based on glibc's rand().  Red Hat recommends use of the following functions for generating unpredictable and non-repeating values pseudo-random numbers.  <http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora_Security_Team//html/Defensive_Coding/ch10s02.html>   ``` |  |
