Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2163:

*   **Vulnerability:** Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Affected Software:** Monkey HTTPD
*   **Root Cause:** The Monkey HTTPD server enters an infinite loop when handling a Range HTTP header with a specific format.  Specifically, when the `Range` header is `Range: bytes=N-N` where `N` is equal to the exact file size, the server gets stuck in a loop attempting to send data.
*   **Vulnerability Details:**
    *   The `mk_http.c` code calculates `bytes_to_send` as `labs(sh->ranges[1] - sh->ranges[0]) + 1;`. When `sh->ranges[0]` and `sh->ranges[1]` are equal (as in `N-N`), `bytes_to_send` becomes 1.
    *   In `mk_http_send_file`, `mk_socket_send_file` returns 0 for `nbytes`, but the function itself returns `sr->bytes_to_send`, which is 1.
    *   `mk_handler_write` checks `sr_node->bytes_to_send > 0`. Since `mk_http_send_file` returns 1, `mk_handler_write` also returns 1.
    *   `mk_conn_write` then receives a return value of 1 from  `mk_handler_write`, indicating data still needs to be sent and returns 0.
    *   `mk_epoll_init` then continues looping because the return value is not `< 0`, causing the infinite loop.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending an HTTP request to the Monkey HTTPD server with a `Range` header crafted as `Range: bytes=N-N`, where N is the file size.
*   **Impact:**  The server thread processing the request enters an infinite loop, consuming resources and potentially leading to a denial of service. The server becomes busy until shutdown.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
