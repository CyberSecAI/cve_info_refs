How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Please use CVE-2013-2221 for this issue.

Please use CVE-2013-2222 for this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

|  |  | == GNU ZRTP 3.2.0 == |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The main ZRTP modules contain fixes for three vulnerabilities found by Mark |
|  |  | Dowd. Thus we advise application developers to use this version of the |
|  |  | library. The vulnerabilities may lead to application crashes during ZRTP |
|  |  | negotiation if an attacker sends prepared ZRTP packets. The fixes remove these |
|  |  | attack vectors. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Some small other enhancements and cleanup, mainly inside client code. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Some enhancements in cache handling and the handling of retained shared |
|  |  | secrets. This change was proposed by Phil, is a slight security enhacement and |
|  |  | is fully backward comaptible. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Because of some API changes clients must be compiled and linked with the new |
|  |  | library. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For details please refer to the Git logs. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | == GNU ZRTP 3.1.0 == |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This version adds some new features and code that supports some other |
|  |  | client and this accounts for the most changes inside this release. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The ZRTP core functionality was not changed as much (bug fixes, cleanup |
|  |  | mainly) and remains fully backward compatible with older library |
|  |  | versions. However, one nice enhancement was done: the addition of a standalone |
|  |  | SDES support module. This module supports basic SDES only without the fancy |
|  |  | stuff like many other SDES implementations. Thus it's pretty interoperable. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Some other features are: |
|  |  | - add some android support for a client, may serve as template for others |
|  |  | - documentation and code cleanup |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Because of some API changes clients must be compiled and linked with the new |
|  |  | library. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | == GNU ZRTP 3.0.0 == |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This is a major enhancement and restructuring of the overall ZRTP |
|  |  | distribution. This was necessary because more and more other clients use ZRTP |
|  |  | and add their specific glue code. Also some clients are not prepared to use |
|  |  | openSSL or other crypto libraries to their code and distributions. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Here a summary of the changes |
|  |  | - a new directory layout to accomodate various clients |
|  |  | - add standalone crypto modules, for example for AES, to have a real |
|  |  | standalone ZRTP/SRTP library that does not require any other crypto library |
|  |  | (optional via CMake configuration) |
|  |  | - Re-structure ZRTP cache and add SQlite3 as optional storage backend |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The default settings for CMake build the normal ZRTP library that use openSSL |
|  |  | as crypto backend, use the normal file based cache and include the GNU ccRTP |
|  |  | modules. This is a librray that is to a large degree compatible with the |
|  |  | earlier builds. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Please refer to the top level CMakeFile.txt for options how to switch on the |
|  |  | standalone crypto mode or the SQlite3 based cache storage. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | == GNU ZRTP 2.3.0 == |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Add a "paranoid" mode to ZRTP. If and applications switches to this mode then |
|  |  | the ZRTP stack \_always\_ asks the user to confirm the SAS thus ZRTP behaves as |
|  |  | if it does not have a cache to store the retained secrets. However, setting |
|  |  | the paranoid mode does not diable the cache, only the GUI behaviour. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Enhance the CMake scripts to build a ZRTP library that does not contain GNU |
|  |  | ccRTP modules and does not require ccRTP dependencies. |
|  |  |  |
