- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PI Interface for IEEE C37.118 could corrupt or exhaust memory when processing C37.118 configuration packets. This is due to an Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in how the software handles C37.118 configuration packets, potentially leading to memory corruption or exhaustion. Specifically, the software does not properly restrict operations within the bounds of the memory buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to shut down the PI Interface for IEEE C37.118 instance, resulting in a data gap for PI points connected to it.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low skill level is required.
