### unvalidated lengths in XQueryDeviceState() [CVE-2013-1998 3/3]

```

If the lengths given for each class state in the reply add up to more
than the rep.length, we could read past the end of the buffer allocated
to hold the data read from the server.

### buffer overflow in XvQueryPortAttributes() [CVE-2013-2066]

```

Each attribute returned in the reply includes the number of bytes
to read for its marker.  We had been always trusting it, and never
validating that it wouldn't cause us to write past the end of the
buffer we allocated based on the reported text_size.

Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1989 CVE-2013-2066

Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive discovered several security issues in
multiple components of the X.org graphics stack and the related
libraries: Various integer overflows, sign handling errors in integer
conversions, buffer overflows, memory corruption and missing input
sanitising may lead to privilege escalation or denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.0.5-1+squeeze1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.0.7-1+deb7u1.

### buffer overflow in XvQueryPortAttributes() [CVE-2013-2066]

```

Each attribute returned in the reply includes the number of bytes
to read for its marker.  We had been always trusting it, and never
validating that it wouldn't cause us to write past the end of the
buffer we allocated based on the reported text_size.

X.Org Security Advisory:  May 23, 2013
Protocol handling issues in X Window System client libraries
============================================================

Description:
============

Ilja van Sprundel, a security researcher with IOActive, has discovered
a large number of issues in the way various X client libraries handle
the responses they receive from servers, and has worked with X.Org's
security team to analyze, confirm, and fix these issues.

Most of these issues stem from the client libraries trusting the server
to send correct protocol data, and not verifying that the values will
not overflow or cause other damage.   Most of the time X clients & servers
are run by the same user, with the server more privileged from the clients,
so this is not a problem, but there are scenarios in which a privileged
client can be connected to an unprivileged server, for instance, connecting
a setuid X client (such as a screen lock program) to a virtual X server
(such as Xvfb or Xephyr) which the user has modified to return invalid
data, potentially allowing the user to escalate their privileges.

The X.Org security team would like to take this opportunity to remind
X client authors that current best practices suggest separating code
that requires privileges from the GUI, to reduce the attack surface of
issues like this.

The vulnerabilities include:

- integer overflows calculating memory needs for replies

     These calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory
     is needed to handle the returned data have not overflowed, so can
     result in allocating too little memory and then writing the returned
     data past the end of the allocated buffer.

     * CVE-2013-1981: libX11 1.5.99.901 (1.6 RC1) and earlier

       and earlier
       Affected functions:  uniDRIOpenConnection(), uniDRIGetClientDriverName()

- sign extension issues calculating memory needs for replies

     These calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory
     is needed to handle the returned data have not had sign extension
     issues when converting smaller integer types to larger ones, leading
     to negative numbers being used in memory size calculations that can
     result in allocating too little memory and then writing the returned
     data past the end of the allocated buffer.

     * CVE-2013-1995: libXi 1.7.1 and earlier
       Affected functions:  XListInputDevices()

     * CVE-2013-1996: libFS 1.0.4 and earlier
       Affected functions:  FSOpenServer()

- buffer overflows due to not validating length or offset values in replies

     These calls do not check that the lengths and/or indexes returned by the
     server are within the bounds specified by the caller or the bounds of the
     memory allocated by the function, so could write past the bounds of
     allocated memory when storing the returned data.

     * CVE-2013-1997: libX11 1.5.99.901 (1.6 RC1) and earlier
       Affected functions:  XAllocColorCells(), _XkbReadGetDeviceInfoReply(),
           _XkbReadGeomShapes(), _XkbReadGetGeometryReply(), _XkbReadKeySyms(),

       Affected functions:  XDGAQueryModes(), XDGASetMode()

     * CVE-2013-2001: libXxf86vm 1.1.2 and earlier
       Affected functions:  XF86VidModeGetGammaRamp()

     * CVE-2013-2002: libXt 1.1.3 and earlier
       Affected functions:  _XtResourceConfigurationEH()

- integer overflows parsing user-specified files

     These calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory
     is needed to handle the data being read have not overflowed, so can
     result in allocating too little memory and then writing the returned
     data past the end of the allocated buffer.

     * CVE-2013-1981: libX11 1.5.99.901 (1.6 RC1) and earlier
       Affected functions:  LoadColornameDB(), XrmGetFileDatabase(),
           _XimParseStringFile(), TransFileName()

     * CVE-2013-2003: libXcursor 1.1.13 and earlier
       Affected functions:  _XcursorFileHeaderCreate()

- unbounded recursion parsing user-specified files

     These calls read in files and handle C-style '#include' directives
     to include other files, and have no limit for how many levels deep
     they will go, including allowing files to #include themselves, until
     the stack overflows from the recursive function calling patterns.

     * CVE-2013-2004: libX11 1.5.99.901 (1.6 RC1) and earlier
       Affected functions:  GetDatabase(), _XimParseStringFile()

- memory corruption due to unchecked return values

     These calls assume that pointers are properly initialized by the
     XGetWindowProperty() function and don't check for failure of the
     function to return a valid window property, which can lead to
     use of uninitialized pointers for reading, writing, or passing to
     functions such as free().   XGetWindowProperty() in libX11 1.5.99.901
     (1.6RC1) and earlier did not ensure returned pointers were initialized
     to NULL when returning a failure (this is fixed in libX11 1.5.99.902
     and later).

     * CVE-2013-2005: libXt 1.1.3 and earlier
       Affected functions:  ReqCleanup(), HandleSelectionEvents(),
           ReqTimedOut(), HandleNormal(), HandleSelectionReplies()

Affected Versions
=================

X.Org believes all prior versions of these libraries contain these
flaws, dating back to their introduction.

Versions of the X libraries built on top of the Xlib bridge to the XCB
framework are vulnerable to fewer issues than those without, due to the
added safety and consistency assertions in the XCB calls to read data
from the network, but most of these vulnerabilities are not caught by
those checks.

Fixes
=====

Fixes are available in git commits and patches which will be listed
on <http://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Security/Advisory-2013-05-23>
when this advisory is released.

# X.Org Security Advisory: May 23, 2013

## Protocol handling issues in X Window System client libraries

### Description

Ilja van Sprundel, a security researcher with IOActive, has discovered a large number of issues in the way various X client libraries handle the responses they receive from servers, and has worked with X.Org's security team to analyze, confirm, and fix these issues.

Most of these issues stem from the client libraries trusting the server to send correct protocol data, and not verifying that the values will not overflow or cause other damage. Most of the time X clients & servers are run by the same user, with the server more privileged from the clients, so this is not a problem, but there are scenarios in which a privileged client can be connected to an unprivileged server, for instance, connecting a setuid X client (such as a screen lock program) to a virtual X server (such as Xvfb or Xephyr) which the user has modified to return invalid data, potentially allowing the user to escalate their privileges.

The X.Org security team would like to take this opportunity to remind X client authors that current best practices suggest separating code that requires privileges from the GUI, to reduce the attack surface of issues like this.

The vulnerabilities include:

* **integer overflows calculating memory needs for replies**
  + *These calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory is needed to handle the returned data have not overflowed, so can result in allocating too little memory and then writing the returned data past the end of the allocated buffer.*

* **sign extension issues calculating memory needs for replies**
  + *These calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory is needed to handle the returned data have not had sign extension issues when converting smaller integer types to larger ones, leading to negative numbers being used in memory size calculations that can result in allocating too little memory and then writing the returned data past the end of the allocated buffer.*
  + CVE-2013-1995: libXi 1.7.1 and earlier
    - Affected functions: XListInputDevices()
  + CVE-2013-1996: libFS 1.0.4 and earlier

  + CVE-2013-2003: libXcursor 1.1.13 and earlier
    - Affected functions: \_XcursorFileHeaderCreate()
* **unbounded recursion parsing user-specified files**
  + *These calls read in files and handle C-style '#include' directives to include other files, and have no limit for how many levels deep they will go, including allowing files to #include themselves, until the stack overflows from the recursive function calling patterns.*
  + CVE-2013-2004: libX11 1.5.99.901 (1.6 RC1) and earlier
    - Affected functions: GetDatabase(), \_XimParseStringFile()
* **memory corruption due to unchecked return values**
  + *These calls assume that pointers are properly initialized by the XGetWindowProperty() function and don't check for failure of the function to return a valid window property, which can lead to use of uninitialized pointers for reading, writing, or passing to functions such as free(). XGetWindowProperty() in libX11 1.5.99.901 (1.6RC1) and earlier did not ensure returned pointers were initialized to NULL when returning a failure (this is fixed in libX11 1.5.99.902 and later).*
  + CVE-2013-2005: libXt 1.1.3 and earlier
    - Affected functions: ReqCleanup(), HandleSelectionEvents(), ReqTimedOut(), HandleNormal(), HandleSelectionReplies()

### Affected Versions

X.Org believes all prior versions of these libraries contain these flaws, dating back to their introduction.

Versions of the X libraries built on top of the Xlib bridge to the XCB framework are vulnerable to fewer issues than those without, due to the added safety and consistency assertions in the XCB calls to read data from the network, but most of these vulnerabilities are not caught by those checks.

### Fixes

Fixes are available in these git commits:

*Note that many of these patches depend on being applied in the same order as they are in git, or on other non-CVE patches in git, and won't necessarily apply in the order listed here to previous tarball releases.*
