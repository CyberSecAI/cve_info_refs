Subject: Xen Security Advisory 54 (CVE-2013-2078) - Hypervisor crash due
 to missing exception recovery on XSETBV

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-2078 / XSA-54
                            version 3

       Hypervisor crash due to missing exception recovery on XSETBV

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Processors do certain validity checks on the register values passed to
XSETBV.  For the PV emulation path for that instruction the hypervisor
code didn't check for certain invalid bit combinations, thus exposing
itself to a fault occurring when invoking that instruction on behalf
of the guest.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or buggy unprivileged user space can cause the entire host
to crash.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.0 and onwards are vulnerable when run on systems with processors
supporting XSAVE.  Only PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.

In Xen 4.0.2 through 4.0.4 as well as in Xen 4.1.x XSAVE support is
disabled by default; therefore systems running these versions are not
vulnerable unless support is explicitly enabled using the "xsave"
hypervisor command line option.

Systems using processors not supporting XSAVE are not vulnerable.

Xen 3.x and earlier are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Turning off XSAVE support via the "no-xsave" hypervisor command line
option will avoid the vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201309-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, allowing attackers
on a Xen Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, cause Denial of
Service, or gain access to data on the host.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r3** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```

Multiple security issues have been discovered in the Xen virtualisation
solution which may result in information leaks or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-3+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
