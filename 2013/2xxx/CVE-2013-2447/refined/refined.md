{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Networking component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) where it fails to prevent the local address from being revealed. Specifically, the implementation does not handle certain network requests in a way that obscures the local address, leading to potential information exposure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of network requests.",
        "Information disclosure of the local address."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially obtain the local address of a system running the vulnerable Java application or applet. This information could be used for further attacks, targeting the local network or performing reconnaissance.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network requests",
      "Untrusted Java applet or application"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to make network requests or execute an untrusted Java application/applet."
  }
