Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2210:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow within the XML Signature Reference functionality of Apache Santuario XML Security for C++. This vulnerability is a result of an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-2154.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Heap-based buffer overflow: The software does not properly handle memory allocation when processing malformed XPointer expressions, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit can cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: There is a possibility that an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the affected system, though this is not guaranteed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malformed XPointer expressions: The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted XPointer expressions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send or provide an XML document with a malformed XPointer expression to the application which performs signature verification with the vulnerable library.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the exploit occurs before signature verification.
-  The attacker could be remote.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Apache Santuario XML Security for C++ (aka xml-security-c) versions before 1.7.2.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jon Erickson of iSIGHT Partners Labs
- A fix was provided in revision r1496703
