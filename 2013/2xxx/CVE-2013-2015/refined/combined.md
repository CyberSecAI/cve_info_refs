ext4: avoid hang when mounting non-journal filesystems with orphan list

```
When trying to mount a file system which does not contain a journal,
but which does have a orphan list containing an inode which needs to
be truncated, the mount call with hang forever in
ext4_orphan_cleanup() because ext4_orphan_del() will return
immediately without removing the inode from the orphan list, leading
to an uninterruptible loop in kernel code which will busy out one of
the CPU's on the system.

This can be trivially reproduced by trying to mount the file system
found in tests/f_orphan_extents_inode/image.gz from the e2fsprogs
source tree.  If a malicious user were to put this on a USB stick, and
mount it on a Linux desktop which has automatic mounts enabled, this
could be considered a potential denial of service attack.  (Not a big
deal in practice, but professional paranoids worry about such things,
and have even been known to allocate CVE numbers for such problems.)

# CVE-2013-2015

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2013-2014.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2013-2016.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2013-2015 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2015)

#### Description

The ext4\_orphan\_del function in fs/ext4/namei.c in the Linux kernel before 3.7.3 does not properly handle orphan-list entries for non-journal filesystems, which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (system hang) via a crafted filesystem on removable media, as demonstrated by the e2fsprogs tests/f\_orphan\_extents\_inode/image.gz test.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [817377](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=817377) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

i915: ensure that VGA plane is disabled
commit 0fde901f1ddd2ce0e380a6444f1fb7ca555859e9 upstream.
Some broken systems (like HP nc6120) in some cases, usually after LID
close/open, enable VGA plane, making display unusable (black screen on LVDS,
some strange mode on VGA output). We used to disable VGA plane only once at
startup. Now we also check, if VGA plane is still disabled while changing
mode, and fix that if something changed it.

ceph: call handle\_cap\_grant() for cap import message

If client sends cap message that requests new max size during
exporting caps, the exporting MDS will drop the message quietly.
So the client may wait for the reply that updates the max size
forever. call handle\_cap\_grant() for cap import message can
avoid this issue.

rbd: remove linger unconditionally
(cherry picked from commit 61c74035626beb25a39b0273ccf7d75510bc36a1)
In \_\_unregister\_linger\_request(), the request is being removed
from the osd client's req\_linger list only when the request
has a non-null osd pointer. It should be done whether or not
the request currently has an osd.
This is most likely a non-issue because I believe the request
will always have an osd when this function is called.

rbd: get rid of RBD\_MAX\_SEG\_NAME\_LEN
(cherry picked from commit 2fd82b9e92c2a718ae81fc987b4468ceeee6979b)
RBD\_MAX\_SEG\_NAME\_LEN represents the maximum length of an rbd object
name (i.e., one of the objects providing storage backing an rbd
image).
Another symbol, MAX\_OBJ\_NAME\_SIZE, is used in the osd client code to
define the maximum length of any object name in an osd request.
Right now they disagree, with RBD\_MAX\_SEG\_NAME\_LEN being too big.
There's no real benefit at this point to defining the rbd object
name length limit separate from any other object name, so just
get rid of RBD\_MAX\_SEG\_NAME\_LEN and use MAX\_OBJ\_NAME\_SIZE in its
place.

rbd: do not allow remove of mounted-on image
(cherry picked from commit 42382b709bd1d143b9f0fa93e0a3a1f2f4210707)
There is no check in rbd\_remove() to see if anybody holds open the
image being removed. That's not cool.
Add a simple open count that goes up and down with opens and closes
(releases) of the device, and don't allow an rbd image to be removed
if the count is non-zero.
Protect the updates of the open count value with ctl\_mutex to ensure
the underlying rbd device doesn't get removed while concurrently
being opened.

rbd: remove snapshots on error in rbd\_add()
(cherry picked from commit 41f38c2b2f8b66b176a0e548ef06294343a7bfa2)
If rbd\_dev\_snaps\_update() has ever been called for an rbd device
structure there could be snapshot structures on its snaps list.
In rbd\_add(), this function is called but a subsequent error
path neglected to clean up any of these snapshots.
Add a call to rbd\_remove\_all\_snaps() in the appropriate spot to
remedy this. Change a couple of error labels to be a little
clearer while there.
Drop the leading underscores from the function name; there's nothing
special about that function that they might signify. As suggested
in review, the leading underscores in \_\_rbd\_remove\_snap\_dev() have
been removed as well.

rbd: increase maximum snapshot name length
(cherry picked from commit d4b125e9eb43babd14538ba61718e3db71a98d29)
Change RBD\_MAX\_SNAP\_NAME\_LEN to be based on NAME\_MAX. That is a
practical limit for the length of a snapshot name (based on the
presence of a directory using the name under /sys/bus/rbd to
represent the snapshot).
The /sys entry is created by prefixing it with "snap\_"; define that
prefix symbolically, and take its length into account in defining
the snapshot name length limit.
Enforce the limit in rbd\_add\_parse\_args(). Also delete a dout()
call in that function that was not meant to be committed.

rbd: zero return code in rbd\_dev\_image\_id()
(cherry picked from commit a0ea3a40fd20b8c66381f747c454f89d6d1f50d4)
When rbd\_dev\_probe() calls rbd\_dev\_image\_id() it expects to get
a 0 return code if successful, but it is getting a positive value.
The reason is that rbd\_dev\_image\_id() returns the value it gets from
rbd\_req\_sync\_exec(), which returns the number of bytes read in as a
result of the request. (This ultimately comes from
ceph\_copy\_from\_page\_vector() in rbd\_req\_sync\_op()).
Force the return value to 0 when successful in rbd\_dev\_image\_id().
Do the same in rbd\_dev\_v2\_object\_prefix().

In rbd\_dev\_id\_put(), there's a loop that's intended to determine

the effect of how it's written is to simply use the just-put id

libceph: remove 'osdtimeout' option
(cherry picked from commit 83aff95eb9d60aff5497e9f44a2ae906b86d8e88)
This would reset a connection with any OSD that had an outstanding
request that was taking more than N seconds. The idea was that if the
OSD was buggy, the client could compensate by resending the request.
In reality, this only served to hide server bugs, and we haven't
actually seen such a bug in quite a while. Moreover, the userspace
client code never did this.
More importantly, often the request is taking a long time because the
OSD is trying to recover, or overloaded, and killing the connection
and retrying would only make the situation worse by giving the OSD
more work to do.

libceph: avoid using freed osd in \_\_kick\_osd\_requests()
(cherry picked from commit 685a7555ca69030739ddb57a47f0ea8ea80196a4)
If an osd has no requests and no linger requests, \_\_reset\_osd()
will just remove it with a call to \_\_remove\_osd(). That drops
a reference to the osd, and therefore the osd may have been free
by the time \_\_reset\_osd() returns. That function offers no
indication this may have occurred, and as a result the osd will
continue to be used even when it's no longer valid.
Change\_\_reset\_osd() so it returns an error (ENODEV) when it
deletes the osd being reset. And change \_\_kick\_osd\_requests() so it
returns immediately (before referencing osd again) if \_\_reset\_osd()
returns \*any\* error.

A number of assertions in the ceph messenger are implemented with
BUG\_ON(), killing the system if connection's state doesn't match
what's expected. At this point our state model is (evidently) not
well understood enough for these assertions to trigger a BUG().
Convert all BUG\_ON(con->state...) calls to be WARN\_ON(con->state...)
so we learn about these issues without killing the machine.
We now recognize that a connection fault can occur due to a socket
closure at any time, regardless of the state of the connection. So
there is really nothing we can assert about the state of the
connection at that point so eliminate that assertion.

libceph: always reset osds when kicking
(cherry picked from commit e6d50f67a6b1a6252a616e6e629473b5c4277218)
When ceph\_osdc\_handle\_map() is called to process a new osd map,
kick\_requests() is called to ensure all affected requests are
updated if necessary to reflect changes in the osd map. This
happens in two cases: whenever an incremental map update is
processed; and when a full map update (or the last one if there is
more than one) gets processed.
In the former case, the kick\_requests() call is followed immediately
by a call to reset\_changed\_osds() to ensure any connections to osds
affected by the map change are reset. But for full map updates
this isn't done.
Both cases should be doing this osd reset.
Rather than duplicating the reset\_changed\_osds() call, move it into
the end of kick\_requests().

libceph: move linger requests sooner in kick\_requests()
(cherry picked from commit ab60b16d3c31b9bd9fd5b39f97dc42c52a50b67d)
The kick\_requests() function is called by ceph\_osdc\_handle\_map()
when an osd map change has been indicated. Its purpose is to
re-queue any request whose target osd is different from what it
was when it was originally sent.
It is structured as two loops, one for incomplete but registered
requests, and a second for handling completed linger requests.
As a special case, in the first loop if a request marked to linger
has not yet completed, it is moved from the request list to the
linger list. This is as a quick and dirty way to have the second
loop handle sending the request along with all the other linger
requests.
Because of the way it's done now, however, this quick and dirty
solution can result in these incomplete linger requests never
getting re-sent as desired. The problem lies in the fact that
the second loop only arranges for a linger request to be sent
if it appears its target osd has changed. This is the proper
handling for \*completed\* linger requests (it avoids issuing
the same linger request twice to the same osd).
But although the linger requests added to the list in the first loop
may have been sent, they have not yet completed, so they need to be
re-sent regardless of whether their target osd has changed.
The first required fix is we need to avoid calling \_\_map\_request()
on any incomplete linger request. Otherwise the subsequent
\_\_map\_request() call in the second loop will find the target osd
has not changed and will therefore not re-send the request.
Second, we need to be sure that a sent but incomplete linger request
gets re-sent. If the target osd is the same with the new osd map as
it was when the request was originally sent, this won't happen.
This can be fixed through careful handling when we move these
requests from the request list to the linger list, by unregistering
the request \*before\* it is registered as a linger request. This
works because a side-effect of unregistering the request is to make
the request's r\_osd pointer be NULL, and \*that\* will ensure the
second loop actually re-sends the linger request.
Processing of such a request is done at that point, so continue with
the next one once it's been moved.

currently get an error message on the log whenever this occurs.
A ceph connection will attempt to reestablish a socket connection

dm thin: fix race between simultaneous io and discards to same block
commit e8088073c9610af017fd47fddd104a2c3afb32e8 upstream.
There is a race when discard bios and non-discard bios are issued
simultaneously to the same block.
Discard support is expensive for all thin devices precisely because you
have to be careful to quiesce the area you're discarding. DM thin must
handle this conflicting IO pattern (simultaneous non-discard vs discard)
even though a sane application shouldn't be issuing such IO.
The race manifests as follows:
1. A non-discard bio is mapped in thin\_bio\_map.
This doesn't lock out parallel activity to the same block.
2. A discard bio is issued to the same block as the non-discard bio.
3. The discard bio is locked in a dm\_bio\_prison\_cell in process\_discard
to lock out parallel activity against the same block.
4. The non-discard bio's mapping continues and its all\_io\_entry is
incremented so the bio is accounted for in the thin pool's all\_io\_ds
which is a dm\_deferred\_set used to track time locality of non-discard IO.
5. The non-discard bio is finally locked in a dm\_bio\_prison\_cell in
process\_bio.
The race can result in deadlock, leaving the block layer hanging waiting
for completion of a discard bio that never completes, e.g.:
INFO: task ruby:15354 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung\_task\_timeout\_secs" disables this message.

The thinp-test-suite's test\_discard\_random\_sectors reliably hits this
deadlock on fast SSD storage.
The fix for this race is that the all\_io\_entry for a bio must be
incremented whilst the dm\_bio\_prison\_cell is held for the bio's
associated virtual and physical blocks. That cell locking wasn't
occurring early enough in thin\_bio\_map. This patch fixes this.
Care is taken to always call the new function inc\_all\_io\_entry() with
the relevant cells locked, but they are generally unlocked before
calling issue() to try to avoid holding the cells locked across
generic\_submit\_request.
Also, now that thin\_bio\_map may lock bios in a cell, process\_bio() is no
longer the only thread that will do so. Because of this we must be sure
to use cell\_defer\_except() to release all non-holder entries, that
were added by the other thread, because they must be deferred.
This patch depends on "dm thin: replace dm\_cell\_release\_singleton with
cell\_defer\_except".

regulator: max8997: Use uV in voltage\_map\_desc
commit bc3b7756b5ff66828acf7bc24f148d28b8d61108 upstream.
Current code does integer division (min\_vol = min\_uV / 1000) before pass
min\_vol to max8997\_get\_voltage\_proper\_val().
So it is possible min\_vol is truncated to a smaller value.
For example, if the request min\_uV is 800900 for ldo.
min\_vol = 800900 / 1000 = 800 (mV)
Then max8997\_get\_voltage\_proper\_val returns 800 mV for this case which is lower
than the requested voltage.
Use uV rather than mV in voltage\_map\_desc to prevent truncation by integer
division.

USB: ehci: make debug port in-use detection functional again
commit 75e1a2ae1f61ce1ae640410ba757bba84bd9fefe upstream.
Debug port in-use determination must be done before the controller gets
reset the first time, i.e. before the call to ehci\_setup() as of commit
1a49e2ac9651df7349867a5cf44e2c83de1046af. That commit effectively
rendered commit 9fa5780beea1274d498a224822397100022da7d4 useless.
While moving that code around, also fix the BAR determination - the
respective capability field is a 3- rather than a 2-bit one -, and use
PCI\_CAP\_ID\_DBG instead of the literal 0x0a.
It's unclear to me whether the debug port functionality is important
enough to warrant fixing this in stable kernels too.

xhci: Handle HS bulk/ctrl endpoints that don't NAK.
commit 55c1945edaac94c5338a3647bc2e85ff75d9cf36 upstream.
A high speed control or bulk endpoint may have bInterval set to zero,
which means it does not NAK. If bInterval is non-zero, it means the
endpoint NAKs at a rate of 2^(bInterval - 1).
The xHCI code to compute the NAK interval does not handle the special
case of zero properly. The current code unconditionally subtracts one
from bInterval and uses it as an exponent. This causes a very large
bInterval to be used, and warning messages like these will be printed:
usb 1-1: ep 0x1 - rounding interval to 32768 microframes, ep desc says 0 microframes
This may cause the xHCI host hardware to reject the Configure Endpoint
command, which means the HS device will be unusable under xHCI ports.
This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that contain
commit dfa49c4ad120a784ef1ff0717168aa79f55a483a "USB: xhci - fix math in

xhci: Avoid "dead ports", add roothub port polling.
commit c52804a472649b2e5005342308739434cbd51119 upstream.
The USB core hub thread (khubd) is designed with external USB hubs in
mind. It expects that if a port status change bit is set, the hub will
continue to send a notification through the hub status data transfer.
Basically, it expects hub notifications to be level-triggered.
The xHCI host controller is designed to be edge-triggered on the logical
'OR' of all the port status change bits. When all port status change
bits are clear, and a new change bit is set, the xHC will generate a
Port Status Change Event. If another change bit is set in the same port
status register before the first bit is cleared, it will not send
another event.
This means that the hub code may lose port status changes because of
race conditions between clearing change bits. The user sees this as a
"dead port" that doesn't react to device connects.
The fix is to turn on port polling whenever a new change bit is set.
Once the USB core issues a hub status request that shows that no change
bits are set in any USB ports, turn off port polling.
We can't allow the USB core to poll the roothub for port events during
host suspend because if the PCI host is in D3cold, the port registers
will be all f's. Instead, stop the port polling timer, and
unconditionally restart it when the host resumes. If there are no port
change bits set after the resume, the first call to hub\_status\_data will
disable polling.
This patch should be backported to stable kernels with the first xHCI
support, 2.6.31 and newer, that include the commit
0f2a79300a1471cf92ab43af165ea13555c8b0a5 "USB: xhci: Root hub support."

USB: Handle warm reset failure on empty port.
commit 65bdac5effd15d6af619b3b7218627ef4d84ed6a upstream.
An empty port can transition to either Inactive or Compliance Mode if a
newly connected USB 3.0 device fails to link train. In that case, we
issue a warm reset. Some devices, such as John's Roseweil eusb3
enclosure, slip back into Compliance Mode after the warm reset.
The current warm reset code does not check for device connect status on
warm reset completion, and it incorrectly reports the warm reset
succeeded. This causes the USB core to attempt to send a Set Address
control transfer to a port in Compliance Mode, which will always fail.
Make hub\_port\_wait\_reset check the current connect status and link state
after the warm reset completes. Return a failure status if the device
is disconnected or the link state is Compliance Mode or SS.Inactive.
Make hub\_events disable the port if warm reset fails. This will disable
the port, and then bring it back into the RxDetect state. Make the USB
core ignore the connect change until the device reconnects.
Note that this patch does NOT handle connected devices slipping into the
Inactive state very well. This is a concern, because devices can go
into the Inactive state on U1/U2 exit failure. However, the fix for
that case is too large for stable, so it will be submitted in a separate
patch.

USB: Ignore port state until reset completes.
commit 4f43447e62b37ee19c82a13f72f35b1ca60a74d3 upstream.
The port reset code bails out early if the current connect status is
cleared (device disconnected). If we're issuing a hot reset, it may
also look at the link state before the reset is finished.
Section 10.14.2.6 of the USB 3.0 spec says that when a port enters the
Error state or Resetting state, the port connection bit retains the
value from the previous state. Therefore we can't trust it until the
reset finishes. Also, the xHCI spec section 4.19.1.2.5 says software
shall ignore the link state while the port is resetting, as it can be in
an unknown state.
The port state during reset is also unknown for USB 2.0 hubs. The hub
sends a reset signal by driving the bus into an SE0 state. This
overwhelms the "connect" signal from the device, so the port can't tell
whether anything is connected or not.
Fix the port reset code to ignore the port link state and current
connect bit until the reset finishes, and USB\_PORT\_STAT\_RESET is
cleared.
Remove the check for USB\_PORT\_STAT\_C\_BH\_RESET in the warm reset case,
because it's redundant. When the warm reset finishes, the port reset
bit will be cleared at the same time USB\_PORT\_STAT\_C\_BH\_RESET is set.
Remove the now-redundant check for a cleared USB\_PORT\_STAT\_RESET bit
in the code to deal with the finished reset.
This patch should be backported to all stable kernels.

USB: Allow USB 3.0 ports to be disabled.
commit 41e7e056cdc662f704fa9262e5c6e213b4ab45dd upstream.
If hot and warm reset fails, or a port remains in the Compliance Mode,
the USB core needs to be able to disable a USB 3.0 port. Unlike USB 2.0
ports, once the port is placed into the Disabled link state, it will not
report any new device connects. To get device connect notifications, we
need to put the link into the Disabled state, and then the RxDetect
state.
The xHCI driver needs to atomically clear all change bits on USB 3.0
port disable, so that we get Port Status Change Events for future port
changes. We could technically do this in the USB core instead of in the
xHCI roothub code, since the port state machine can't advance out of the
disabled state until we set the link state to RxDetect. However,
external USB 3.0 hubs don't need this code. They are level-triggered,
not edge-triggered like xHCI, so they will continue to send interrupt
events when any change bit is set. Therefore it doesn't make sense to
put this code in the USB core.
This patch is part of a series to fix several reports of infinite loops
on device enumeration failure. This includes John, when he boots with
a USB 3.0 device (Roseweil eusb3 enclosure) attached to his NEC 0.96
host controller. The fix requires warm reset support, so it does not
make sense to backport this patch to stable kernels without warm reset
support.

USB: Ignore xHCI Reset Device status.
commit 8b8132bc3d1cc3d4c0687e4d638a482fa920d98a upstream.
When the USB core finishes reseting a USB device, the xHCI driver sends
a Reset Device command to the host. The xHC then updates its internal
representation of the USB device to the 'Default' device state. If the
device was already in the Default state, the xHC will complete the
command with an error status.
If a device needs to be reset several times during enumeration, the
second reset will always fail because of the xHCI Reset Device command.
This can cause issues during enumeration.
For example, usb\_reset\_and\_verify\_device calls into hub\_port\_init in a
loop. Say that on the first call into hub\_port\_init, the device is
successfully reset, but doesn't respond to several set address control
transfers. Then the port will be disabled, but the udev will remain in
tact. usb\_reset\_and\_verify\_device will call into hub\_port\_init again.
On the second call into hub\_port\_init, the device will be reset, and the
xHCI driver will issue a Reset Device command. This command will fail
(because the device is already in the Default state), and
usb\_reset\_and\_verify\_device will fail. The port will be disabled, and
the device won't be able to enumerate.
Fix this by ignoring the return value of the HCD reset\_device callback.

usb: gadget: dummy: fix enumeration with g\_multi
commit 1d16638e3b9cc195bac18a8fcbca748f33c1bc24 upstream.
If we do have endpoints named like "ep-a" then bEndpointAddress is
counted internally by the gadget framework.
If we do have endpoints named like "ep-1" then bEndpointAddress is
assigned from the digit after "ep-".
If we do have both, then it is likely that after we used up the
"generic" endpoints we will use the digits and thus assign one
bEndpointAddress to multiple endpoints.
This theory can be proofed by using the completely enabled g\_multi.
Without this patch, the mass storage won't enumerate and times out
because it shares endpoints with RNDIS.
This patch also adds fills up the endpoints list so we have in total
endpoints 1 to 15 in + out available while some of them are restricted
to certain types like BULK or ISO. Without this change the nokia gadget
won't load because the system does not provide enough (BULK) endpoints
but it did before ep-a - ep-f were removed.

b43: Fix firmware loading when driver is built into the kernel
commit 5e20a4b53094651d80f856ff55a916b999dbb57a upstream.
Recent versions of udev cause synchronous firmware loading from the
probe routine to fail because the request to user space would time
out. The original fix for b43 (commit 6b6fa58) moved the firmware
load from the probe routine to a work queue, but it still used synchronous
firmware loading. This method is OK when b43 is built as a module;
however, it fails when the driver is compiled into the kernel.
This version changes the code to load the initial firmware file
using request\_firmware\_nowait(). A completion event is used to
hold the work queue until that file is available. This driver
reads several firmware files - the remainder can be read synchronously.
On some test systems, the async read fails; however, a following synch
read works, thus the async failure falls through to the sync try.

mac80211: fix station destruction in AP/mesh modes
commit 97f97b1f5fe0878b35c8e314f98591771696321b upstream.
Unfortunately, commit b22cfcfcae5b, intended to speed up roaming
by avoiding the synchronize\_rcu() broke AP/mesh modes as it moved
some code into that work item that will still call into the driver
at a time where it's no longer expected to handle this: after the
AP or mesh has been stopped.
To fix this problem remove the per-station work struct, maintain a
station cleanup list instead and flush this list when stations are
flushed. To keep this patch smaller for stable, do this when the
stations are flushed (sta\_info\_flush()). This unfortunately brings
back the original roaming delay; I'll fix that again in a separate
patch.
Also, Ben reported that the original commit could sometimes (with
many interfaces) cause long delays when an interface is set down,
due to blocking on flush\_workqueue(). Since we now maintain the
cleanup list, this particular change of the original patch can be
reverted.

staging: comedi: comedi\_test: fix race when cancelling command
commit c0729eeefdcd76db338f635162bf0739fd2c5f6f upstream.
Éric Piel reported a kernel oops in the "comedi\_test" module. It was a
NULL pointer dereference within `waveform\_ai\_interrupt()` (actually a
timer function) that sometimes occurred when a running asynchronous
command is cancelled (either by the `COMEDI\_CANCEL` ioctl or by closing
the device file).
This seems to be a race between the caller of `waveform\_ai\_cancel()`
which on return from that function goes and tears down the running
command, and the timer function which uses the command. In particular,
`async->cmd.chanlist` gets freed (and the pointer set to NULL) by
`do\_become\_nonbusy()` in "comedi\_fops.c" but a previously scheduled
`waveform\_ai\_interrupt()` timer function will dereference that pointer
regardless, leading to the oops.
Fix it by replacing the `del\_timer()` call in `waveform\_ai\_cancel()`
with `del\_timer\_sync()`.

The minimum period was set to 357 ns, while the divider for these boards is 50
ns. This prevented to output at maximum speed as ni\_ao\_cmdtest() would return
357 but would not accept it.
Not sure why it was set to 357 ns (this was done before the git history,
which starts 5 years ago). My guess is that it comes from reading the
specification stating a 2.8 MHz rate (~ 357 ns). The latest
specification states a 2.86 MHz rate (~ 350 ns), which makes a lot
more sense.

staging: comedi: prevent auto-unconfig of manually configured devices
commit 7d3135af399e92cf4c9bbc5f86b6c140aab3b88c upstream.
When a low-level comedi driver auto-configures a device, a `struct
comedi\_dev\_file\_info` is allocated (as well as a `struct
comedi\_device`) by `comedi\_alloc\_board\_minor()`. A pointer to the
hardware `struct device` is stored as a cookie in the `struct
comedi\_dev\_file\_info`. When the low-level comedi driver
auto-unconfigures the device, `comedi\_auto\_unconfig()` uses the cookie
to find the `struct comedi\_dev\_file\_info` so it can detach the comedi
device from the driver, clean it up and free it.
A problem arises if the user manually unconfigures and reconfigures the
comedi device using the `COMEDI\_DEVCONFIG` ioctl so that is no longer
associated with the original hardware device. The problem is that the
cookie is not cleared, so that a call to `comedi\_auto\_unconfig()` from
the low-level driver will still find it, detach it, clean it up and free
it.
Stop this problem occurring by always clearing the `hardware\_device`
cookie in the `struct comedi\_dev\_file\_info` whenever the
`COMEDI\_DEVCONFIG` ioctl call is successful.

ALSA: pxa27x: fix ac97 warm reset
commit 3b4bc7bccc7857274705b05cf81a0c72cfd0b0dd upstream.
This patch fixes some code that implements a work-around to a hardware bug in
the ac97 controller on the pxa27x. A bug in the controller's warm reset
functionality requires that the mfp used by the controller as the AC97\_nRESET
line be temporarily reconfigured as a generic output gpio (AF0) and manually
held high for the duration of the warm reset cycle. This is what was done in
the original code, but it was broken long ago by commit fb1bf8cd
([ARM] pxa: introduce processor specific pxa27x\_assert\_ac97reset())
which changed the mfp to a GPIO input instead of a high output.
The fix requires the ac97 controller to obtain the gpio via gpio\_request\_one(),
with arguments that configure the gpio as an output initially driven high.
Tested on a palm treo 680 machine. Reportedly, this broken code only prevents a
warm reset on hardware that lacks a pull-up on the line, which appears to be the
case for me.

manual is mostly incoherent on the topic of ac97 reset), I got cold reset to
complete by setting the WARM\_RST bit in the GCR register (and later noticed that
pxa3xx does this for cold reset as well). Also, a timeout loop is needed to
wait for the reset to complete.

vfs: add missing virtual cache flush after editing partial pages
commit 6d283dba3721cc43be014b50a1acc2f35860a65a upstream.
Andrew Morton pointed this out a month ago, and then I completely forgot
about it.
If we read a partial last page of a block device, we will zero out the
end of the page, but since that page can then be mapped into user space,
we should also make sure to flush the cache on architectures that have
virtual caches. We have the flush\_dcache\_page() function for this, so
use it.
Now, in practice this really never matters, because nobody sane uses
virtual caches to begin with, and they largely exist on old broken RISC
arhitectures.
And even if you did run on one of those obsolete CPU's, the whole "mmap
and access the last partial page of a block device" behavior probably
doesn't actually exist. The normal IO functions (read/write) will never
see the zeroed-out part of the page that migth not be coherent in the
cache, because they honor the size of the device.
So I'm marking this for stable (3.7 only), but I'm not sure anybody will
ever care.

udldrmfb: Fix EDID not working with monitors with EDID extension blocks
commit c930812fe5ebe725760422c9c351d1f6fde1502d upstream.
udldrmfb only reads the main EDID block, and if that advertises extensions
the drm\_edid code expects them to be present, and starts reading beyond the
buffer udldrmfb passes it.
Although it may be possible to read more EDID info with the udl we simpy don't
know how, and even if trial and error gets it working on one device, that is
no guarantee it will work on other revisions. So this patch does a simple fix
in the form of patching the EDID info to report 0 extension blocks, this
fixes udldrmfb only doing 1024x768 on monitors with EDID extension blocks.

epoll: prevent missed events on EPOLL\_CTL\_MOD
commit 128dd1759d96ad36c379240f8b9463e8acfd37a1 upstream.
EPOLL\_CTL\_MOD sets the interest mask before calling f\_op->poll() to
ensure events are not missed. Since the modifications to the interest
mask are not protected by the same lock as ep\_poll\_callback, we need to
ensure the change is visible to other CPUs calling ep\_poll\_callback.
We also need to ensure f\_op->poll() has an up-to-date view of past
events which occured before we modified the interest mask. So this
barrier also pairs with the barrier in wq\_has\_sleeper().
This should guarantee either ep\_poll\_callback or f\_op->poll() (or both)
will notice the readiness of a recently-ready/modified item.

aoe: remove vestigial request queue allocation
commit 0a41409c518083133e79015092585d68915865be upstream.
Before the aoe driver was an I/O request handler, it was a
make\_request-style block driver. Even so, there was a problem where
sysfs expected a request queue to exist, so one was provided in commit
7135a71b19be ("aoe: allocate unused request\_queue for sysfs").
During the transition to the request-handler style, a patch was merged
that was based on a driver without the noop queue, and the noop queue
remained in place after the patch was merged, even though a new
functional queue was introduced by the patch, allocated through
blk\_init\_queue.
The user impact is a memory leak proportional to the number of AoE
targets discovered. This patch removes the memory leak and cleans up
vestiges of the old do-nothing queue from the aoeblk\_gdalloc function.

ext4: avoid hang when mounting non-journal filesystems with orphan list
commit 0e9a9a1ad619e7e987815d20262d36a2f95717ca upstream.
When trying to mount a file system which does not contain a journal,
but which does have a orphan list containing an inode which needs to
be truncated, the mount call with hang forever in
ext4\_orphan\_cleanup() because ext4\_orphan\_del() will return
immediately without removing the inode from the orphan list, leading
to an uninterruptible loop in kernel code which will busy out one of
the CPU's on the system.
This can be trivially reproduced by trying to mount the file system
found in tests/f\_orphan\_extents\_inode/image.gz from the e2fsprogs
source tree. If a malicious user were to put this on a USB stick, and
mount it on a Linux desktop which has automatic mounts enabled, this
could be considered a potential denial of service attack. (Not a big
deal in practice, but professional paranoids worry about such things,
and have even been known to allocate CVE numbers for such problems.)

ext4: do not try to write superblock on ro remount w/o journal
commit d096ad0f79a782935d2e06ae8fb235e8c5397775 upstream.
When a journal-less ext4 filesystem is mounted on a read-only block
device (blockdev --setro will do), each remount (for other, unrelated,
flags, like suid=>nosuid etc) results in a series of scary messages
from kernel telling about I/O errors on the device.
This is becauese of the following code ext4\_remount():
if (sbi->s\_journal == NULL)
ext4\_commit\_super(sb, 1);
at the end of remount procedure, which forces writing (flushing) of
a superblock regardless whenever it is dirty or not, if the filesystem
is readonly or not, and whenever the device itself is readonly or not.
We only need call ext4\_commit\_super when the file system had been
previously mounted read/write.

PM: Move disabling/enabling runtime PM to late suspend/early resume
commit 9f6d8f6ab26b42620a914d67f29822f9bba90233 upstream.
Currently, the PM core disables runtime PM for all devices right
after executing subsystem/driver .suspend() callbacks for them
and re-enables it right before executing subsystem/driver .resume()
callbacks for them. This may lead to problems when there are
two devices such that the .suspend() callback executed for one of
them depends on runtime PM working for the other. In that case,
if runtime PM has already been disabled for the second device,
the first one's .suspend() won't work correctly (and analogously
for resume).
To make those issues go away, make the PM core disable runtime PM
for devices right before executing subsystem/driver .suspend\_late()
callbacks for them and enable runtime PM for them right after
executing subsystem/driver .resume\_early() callbacks for them. This
way the potential conflitcs between .suspend\_late()/.resume\_early()
and their runtime PM counterparts are still prevented from happening,
but the subtle ordering issues related to disabling/enabling runtime
PM for devices during system suspend/resume are much easier to avoid.

audit: create explicit AUDIT\_SECCOMP event type
commit 7b9205bd775afc4439ed86d617f9042ee9e76a71 upstream.
The seccomp path was using AUDIT\_ANOM\_ABEND from when seccomp mode 1
could only kill a process. While we still want to make sure an audit
record is forced on a kill, this should use a separate record type since
seccomp mode 2 introduces other behaviors.
In the case of "handled" behaviors (process wasn't killed), only emit a
record if the process is under inspection. This change also fixes
userspace examination of seccomp audit events, since it was considered
malformed due to missing fields of the AUDIT\_ANOM\_ABEND event type.

hwmon: (lm73} Detect and report i2c bus errors
commit 0602934f302e016e2ea5dc6951681bfac77455ef upstream.
If an LM73 device does not exist on an I2C bus, attempts to communicate
with the device result in an error code returned from the i2c read/write
functions. The current lm73 driver casts that return value from a s32
type to a s16 type, then converts it to a temperature in celsius.
Because negative temperatures are valid, it is difficult to distinguish
between an error code printed to the response buffer and a negative
temperature recorded by the sensor.
The solution is to evaluate the return value from the i2c functions
before performing any temperature calculations. If the i2c function did
not succeed, the error code should be passed back through the virtual
file system layer instead of being printed into the response buffer.
Before:
$ cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/device/temp1\_input
-46
After:
$ cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/device/temp1\_input

dm thin: replace dm\_cell\_release\_singleton with cell\_defer\_except
commit b7ca9c9273e5eebd63880dd8a6e4e5c18fc7901d upstream.
Change existing users of the function dm\_cell\_release\_singleton to share
cell\_defer\_except instead, and then remove the now-unused function.
Everywhere that calls dm\_cell\_release\_singleton, the bio in question
is the holder of the cell.
If there are no non-holder entries in the cell then cell\_defer\_except
behaves exactly like dm\_cell\_release\_singleton. Conversely, if there
\*are\* non-holder entries then dm\_cell\_release\_singleton must not be used
because those entries would need to be deferred.
Consequently, it is safe to replace use of dm\_cell\_release\_singleton
with cell\_defer\_except.

dm ioctl: prevent unsafe change to dm\_ioctl data\_size
commit e910d7ebecd1aac43125944a8641b6cb1a0dfabe upstream.
Abort dm ioctl processing if userspace changes the data\_size parameter
after we validated it but before we finished copying the data buffer
from userspace.
The dm ioctl parameters are processed in the following sequence:
1. ctl\_ioctl() calls copy\_params();
2. copy\_params() makes a first copy of the fixed-sized portion of the
userspace parameters into the local variable "tmp";
3. copy\_params() then validates tmp.data\_size and allocates a new
structure big enough to hold the complete data and copies the whole
userspace buffer there;
4. ctl\_ioctl() reads userspace data the second time and copies the whole
buffer into the pointer "param";
5. ctl\_ioctl() reads param->data\_size without any validation and stores it
in the variable "input\_param\_size";
6. "input\_param\_size" is further used as the authoritative size of the
kernel buffer.
The problem is that userspace code could change the contents of user
memory between steps 2 and 4. In particular, the data\_size parameter
can be changed to an invalid value after the kernel has validated it.
This lets userspace force the kernel to access invalid kernel memory.
The fix is to ensure that the size has not changed at step 4.
This patch shouldn't have a security impact because CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN is
required to run this code, but it should be fixed anyway.

drm/i915: Revert shrinker changes from "Track unbound pages"

drm/i915: Track unbound pages
Closer inspection of that patch revealed a bunch of unrelated changes
in the shrinker:
- The shrinker count is now in pages instead of objects.
- For counting the shrinkable objects the old code only looked at the
inactive list, the new code looks at all bounds objects (including
pinned ones). That is obviously in addition to the new unbound list.
- The shrinker cound is no longer scaled with
sysctl\_vfs\_cache\_pressure. Note though that with the default tuning
value of vfs\_cache\_pressue = 100 this doesn't affect the shrinker
behaviour.
- When actually shrinking objects, the old code first dropped
purgeable objects, then normal (inactive) objects. Only then did it,
in a last-ditch effort idle the gpu and evict everything. The new
code omits the intermediate step of evicting normal inactive
objects.
Safe for the first change, which seems benign, and the shrinker count
scaling, which is a bit a different story, the endresult of all these
changes is that the shrinker is \_much\_ more likely to fall back to the
last-ditch resort of idling the gpu and evicting everything. The old
code could only do that if something else evicted lots of objects
meanwhile (since without any other changes the nr\_to\_scan will be
smaller than the object count).
Reverting the vfs\_cache\_pressure behaviour itself is a bit bogus: Only
dentry/inode object caches should scale their shrinker counts with
vfs\_cache\_pressure. Originally I've had that change reverted, too. But
Chris Wilson insisted that it's too bogus and shouldn't again see the
light of day.
Hence revert all these other changes and restore the old shrinker
behaviour, with the minor adjustment that we now first scan the
unbound list, then the inactive list for each object category
(purgeable or normal).
A similar patch has been tested by a few people affected by the gen4/5
hangs which started to appear in 3.7, which some people bisected to
the "drm/i915: Track unbound pages" commit. But just disabling the
unbound logic alone didn't change things at all.
Note that this patch doesn't fix the referenced bugs, it only hides
the underlying bug(s) well enough to restore pre-3.7 behaviour. The
key to achieve that is to massively reduce the likelyhood of going
into a full gpu stall and evicting everything.
v2: Reword commit message a bit, taking Chris Wilson's comment into
account.
v3: On Chris Wilson's insistency, do not reinstate the rather bogus
vfs\_cache\_pressure change.

we do apply the range restriction and color adjustment in the same

Note that this seems to be ducttape of decent quality ot paper over

drm/i915: don't disable disconnected outputs
commit b0a2658acb5bf9ca86b4aab011b7106de3af0add upstream.
This piece of neat lore has been ported painstakingly and bug-for-bug
compatible from the old crtc helper code.
Imo it's utter nonsense.
If you disconnected a cable and before you reconnect it, userspace (or
the kernel) does an set\_crtc call, this will result in that connector
getting disabled. Which will result in a nice black screen when
plugging in the cable again.
There's absolutely no reason the kernel does such policy enforcements
- if userspace tries to set up a mode on something disconnected we
might fail loudly (since the dp link training fails), but silently
adjusting the output configuration behind userspace's back is a recipe
for disaster. Specifically I think that this could explain some of our
MI\_WAIT hangs around suspend, where userspace issues a scanline wait
on a disable pipe. This mechanisims here could explain how that pipe
got disabled without userspace noticing.
Note that this fixes a NULL deref at BIOS takeover when the firmware
sets up a disconnected output in a clone configuration with a
connected output on the 2nd pipe: When doing the full modeset we don't
have a mode for the 2nd pipe and OOPS. On the first pipe this doesn't
matter, since at boot-up the fbdev helpers will set up the choosen
configuration on that on first. Since this is now the umptenth bug
around handling this imo brain-dead semantics correctly, I think it's
time to kill it and see whether there's any userspace out there which
relies on this.
It also nicely demonstrates that we have a tiny window where DP
hotplug can still kill the driver.

drm/i915: Flush outstanding unpin tasks before pageflipping
commit b4a98e57fc27854b5938fc8b08b68e5e68b91e1f upstream.
If we accumulate unpin tasks because we are pageflipping faster than the
system can schedule its workers, we can effectively create a
pin-leak. The solution taken here is to limit the number of unpin tasks
we have per-crtc and to flush those outstanding tasks if we accumulate
too many. This should prevent any jitter in the normal case, and also
prevent the hang if we should run too fast.
Note: It is important that we switch from the system workqueue to our
own dev\_priv->wq since all work items on that queue are guaranteed to
only need the dev->struct\_mutex and not any modeset resources. For
otherwise if we have a work item ahead in the queue which needs the
modeset lock (like the output detect work used by both polling or
hpd), this work and so the unpin work will never execute since the
pageflip code already holds that lock. Unfortunately there's no
lockdep support for this scenario in the workqueue code.

drm/i915: Close race between processing unpin task and queueing the flip
commit e7d841ca03b7ab668620045cd7b428eda9f41601 upstream.
Before queuing the flip but crucially after attaching the unpin-work to
the crtc, we continue to setup the unpin-work. However, should the
hardware fire early, we see the connected unpin-work and queue the task.
The task then promptly runs and unpins the fb before we finish taking
the required references or even pinning it... Havoc.
To close the race, we use the flip-pending atomic to indicate when the
flip is finally setup and enqueued. So during the flip-done processing,
we can check more accurately whether the flip was expected.
v2: Add the appropriate mb() to ensure that the writes to the page-flip
worker are complete prior to marking it active and emitting the MI\_FLIP.
On the read side, the mb should be enforced by the spinlocks.

[danvet: Review the barriers a bit, we need a write barrier both
before and after updating ->pending. Similarly we need a read barrier
in the interrupt handler both before and after reading ->pending. With
well-ordered irqs only one barrier in each place should be required,
but since this patch explicitly sets out to combat spurious interrupts
with is staged activation of the unpin work we need to go full-bore on
the barriers, too. Discussed with Chris Wilson on irc and changes

mm: compaction: partially revert capture of suitable high-order page
commit 8fb74b9fb2b182d54beee592350d9ea1f325917a upstream.
Eric Wong reported on 3.7 and 3.8-rc2 that ppoll() got stuck when
waiting for POLLIN on a local TCP socket. It was easier to trigger if
there was disk IO and dirty pages at the same time and he bisected it to
commit 1fb3f8ca0e92 ("mm: compaction: capture a suitable high-order page
immediately when it is made available").
The intention of that patch was to improve high-order allocations under
memory pressure after changes made to reclaim in 3.6 drastically hurt
THP allocations but the approach was flawed. For Eric, the problem was
that page->pfmemalloc was not being cleared for captured pages leading
to a poor interaction with swap-over-NFS support causing the packets to
be dropped. However, I identified a few more problems with the patch
including the fact that it can increase contention on zone->lock in some
cases which could result in async direct compaction being aborted early.
In retrospect the capture patch took the wrong approach. What it should
have done is mark the pageblock being migrated as MIGRATE\_ISOLATE if it
was allocating for THP and avoided races that way. While the patch was
showing to improve allocation success rates at the time, the benefit is
marginal given the relative complexity and it should be revisited from
scratch in the context of the other reclaim-related changes that have
taken place since the patch was first written and tested. This patch
partially reverts commit 1fb3f8ca0e92 ("mm: compaction: capture a
suitable high-order page immediately when it is made available").

intel-iommu: Free old page tables before creating superpage
commit 6491d4d02893d9787ba67279595990217177b351 upstream.
The dma\_pte\_free\_pagetable() function will only free a page table page
if it is asked to free the \*entire\* 2MiB range that it covers. So if a
page table page was used for one or more small mappings, it's likely to
end up still present in the page tables... but with no valid PTEs.
This was fine when we'd only be repopulating it with 4KiB PTEs anyway
but the same virtual address range can end up being reused for a
\*large-page\* mapping. And in that case were were trying to insert the
large page into the second-level page table, and getting a complaint
from the sanity check in \_\_domain\_mapping() because there was already a
corresponding entry. This was \*relatively\* harmless; it led to a memory
leak of the old page table page, but no other ill-effects.
Fix it by calling dma\_pte\_clear\_range (hopefully redundant) and
dma\_pte\_free\_pagetable() before setting up the new large page.

SUNRPC: Ensure we release the socket write lock if the rpc\_task exits early
commit 87ed50036b866db2ec2ba16b2a7aec4a2b0b7c39 upstream.
If the rpc\_task exits while holding the socket write lock before it has
allocated an rpc slot, then the usual mechanism for releasing the write
lock in xprt\_release() is defeated.
The problem occurs if the call to xprt\_lock\_write() initially fails, so
that the rpc\_task is put on the xprt->sending wait queue. If the task
exits after being assigned the lock by \_\_xprt\_lock\_write\_func, but
before it has retried the call to xprt\_lock\_and\_alloc\_slot(), then
it calls xprt\_release() while holding the write lock, but will
immediately exit due to the test for task->tk\_rqstp != NULL.

Commit bbf43dc888833ac0539e437dbaeb28bfd4fbab9f "sunrpc/cache.h: replace

to fail on unsigned integers too large to be represented as an int.
We could parse them as unsigned instead--but it turns out svcgssd is
actually passing down "-1" in some cases. Which is perhaps stupid, but
there's nothing we can do about it now.
So just revert back to the previous "sloppy" behavior that accepts
either representation.

OMAP: board-files: fix i2c\_bus for tfp410
commit ca2e16faa7378878c1522a7c1b6c38211de3331d upstream.
The i2c handling in tfp410 driver, which handles converting parallel RGB
to DVI, was changed in 958f2717b84e88bf833d996997fda8f73276f2af
(OMAPDSS: TFP410: pdata rewrite). The patch changed what value the
driver considers as invalid/undefined. Before the patch, 0 was the
invalid value, but as 0 is a valid bus number, the patch changed this to
-1.
However, the fact was missed that many board files do not define the bus
number at all, thus it's left to 0. This causes the driver to fail to
get the i2c bus, exiting from the driver's probe with an error, meaning
that the DVI output does not work for those boards.
This patch fixes the issue by changing the i2c\_bus number field in the
driver's platform data from u16 to int, and setting the bus number to -1
in the board files for the boards that did not define the bus. The
exception is devkit8000, for which the bus is set to 1, which is the
correct bus for that board.
The bug exists in v3.5+ kernels.

mtd: nand: gpmi: reset BCH earlier, too, to avoid NAND startup problems

It could happen (1 out of 100 times) that NAND did not start up
correctly after warm rebooting, so the kernel could not find the UBI or
DMA timed out due to a stalled BCH. When resetting BCH together with
GPMI, the issue could not be observed anymore (after 10000+ reboots). We
probably need the consistent state already before sending any command to
NAND, even when no ECC is needed. I chose to keep the extra reset for
BCH when changing the flash layout to be on the safe side.

mfd: Only unregister platform devices allocated by the mfd core
commit b9fbb62eb61452d728c39b2e5020739c575aac53 upstream.
mfd\_remove\_devices would iterate over all devices sharing a parent with
an mfd device regardless of whether they were allocated by the mfd core
or not. This especially caused problems when the device structure was
not contained within a platform\_device, because to\_platform\_device is
used on each device pointer.
This patch defines a device\_type for mfd devices and checks this is
present from mfd\_remove\_devices\_fn before processing the device.

sbp-target: fix error path in sbp\_make\_tpg()
commit e1fe2060d7e8f58a69374135e32e90f0bb79a7fd upstream.
If the TPG memory is allocated successfully, but we fail further along
in the function, a dangling pointer to freed memory is left in the TPort
structure. This is mostly harmless, but does prevent re-trying the
operation without first removing the TPort altogether.

target/tcm\_fc: fix the lockdep warning due to inconsistent lock state
commit 9f4ad44b264f8bb61ffdd607148215566568430d upstream.
The lockdep warning below is in theory correct but it will be in really weird
rare situation that ends up that deadlock since the tcm fc session is hashed
based the rport id. Nonetheless, the complaining below is about rcu callback
that does the transport\_deregister\_session() is happening in softirq, where
transport\_register\_session() that happens earlier is not. This triggers the
lockdep warning below. So, just fix this to make lockdep happy by disabling
the soft irq before calling transport\_register\_session() in ft\_prli.
BTW, this was found in FCoE VN2VN over two VMs, couple of create and destroy
would get this triggered.
v1: was enforcing register to be in softirq context which was not righ. See,
http://www.spinics.net/lists/target-devel/msg03614.html
v2: following comments from Roland&Nick (thanks), it seems we don't have to
do transport\_deregister\_session() in rcu callback, so move it into ft\_sess\_free()
but still do kfree() of the corresponding ft\_sess struct in rcu callback to
make sure the ft\_sess is not freed till the rcu callback.

commit ceb7decb366591e9b67d70832e07f5d240572a3d upstream.
lockdep warns about taking a hard-irq-unsafe lock (sriov->id\_map\_lock)
inside a hard-irq-safe lock (sriov->going\_down\_lock).
Since id\_map\_lock is never taken in the interrupt context, we can
simply reverse the order of taking the two spinlocks, thus avoiding
the warning and the depencency.

SN06 in some cases returns an Integer instead of a buffer. While the
code handling the return value was trying to cope with the difference,
the memcpy call was not making any difference between the two types of
acpi\_object union. This regression was introduced in 3.5.
While there also rework the return value logic to improve readability.

sata\_promise: fix hardreset lockdep error
commit 3100d49d3cd236443faae9d81137c81b22d36003 upstream.
sata\_promise's pdc\_hard\_reset\_port() needs to serialize because it
flips a port-specific bit in controller register that's shared by
all ports. The code takes the ata host lock for this, but that's
broken because an interrupt may arrive on our irq during the hard
reset sequence, and that too will take the ata host lock. With
lockdep enabled a big nasty warning is seen.
Fixed by adding private state to the ata host structure, containing
a second lock used only for serializing the hard reset sequences.
This eliminated the lockdep warnings both on my test rig and on
the original reporter's machine.

wrap-around within iscsit\_ack\_from\_expstatsn() code.
This bug would manifest itself as iscsi\_cmd descriptors not being Acked
by a lower ExpStatSn, causing them to be leaked until an iSCSI connection
or session reinstatement event occurs to release all commands.
Also fix up two other uses of incorrect CmdSN SNA comparison to use wrapper
usage from include/scsi/iscsi\_proto.h.

SCSI: qla2xxx: Test and clear FCPORT\_UPDATE\_NEEDED atomically.
commit a394aac88506159e047630fc90dc2242568382d8 upstream.
When the qla2xxx driver loses access to multiple, remote ports, there is a race
condition which can occur which will keep the request stuck on a scsi request
queue indefinitely.
This bad state occurred do to a race condition with how the FCPORT\_UPDATE\_NEEDED
bit is set in qla2x00\_schedule\_rport\_del(), and how it is cleared in
qla2x00\_do\_dpc(). The problem port has its drport pointer set, but it has never
been processed by the driver to inform the fc transport that the port has been
lost. qla2x00\_schedule\_rport\_del() sets drport, and then sets the
FCPORT\_UPDATE\_NEEDED bit. In qla2x00\_do\_dpc(), the port lists are walked and
any drport pointer is handled and the fc transport informed of the port loss,
then the FCPORT\_UPDATE\_NEEDED bit is cleared. This leaves a race where the
dpc thread is processing one port removal, another port removal is marked
with a call to qla2x00\_schedule\_rport\_del(), and the dpc thread clears the
bit for both removals, even though only the first removal was actually
handled. Until another event occurs to set FCPORT\_UPDATE\_NEEDED, the later
port removal is never finished and qla2xxx stays in a bad state which causes
requests to become stuck on request queues.
This patch updates the driver to test and clear FCPORT\_UPDATE\_NEEDED
atomically. This ensures the port state changes are processed and not lost.

SCSI: prevent stack buffer overflow in host\_reset
commit 072f19b4bea31cdd482d79f805413f2f9ac9e233 upstream.
store\_host\_reset() has tried to re-invent the wheel to compare sysfs strings.
Unfortunately it did so poorly and never bothered to check the input from
userspace before overwriting stack with it, so something simple as:
echo "WoopsieWoopsie" >
/sys/devices/pseudo\_0/adapter0/host0/scsi\_host/host0/host\_reset
would result in:

SCSI: mvsas: fix undefined bit shift
commit beecadea1b8d67f591b13f7099559f32f3fd601d upstream.
The macro bit(n) is defined as ((u32)1 << n), and thus it doesn't work
with n >= 32, such as in mvs\_94xx\_assign\_reg\_set():
if (i >= 32) {
mvi->sata\_reg\_set |= bit(i);
...
}
The shift ((u32)1 << n) with n >= 32 also leads to undefined behavior.
The result varies depending on the architecture.
This patch changes bit(n) to do a 64-bit shift. It also simplifies
mv\_ffc64() using \_\_ffs64(), since invoking ffz() with ~0 is undefined.

watchdog: Fix disable/enable regression
commit 3935e89505a1c3ab3f3b0c7ef0eae54124f48905 upstream.
Commit 8d4516904b39 ("watchdog: Fix CPU hotplug regression") causes an
oops or hard lockup when doing
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi\_watchdog
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi\_watchdog
and the kernel is booted with nmi\_watchdog=1 (default)
Running laptop-mode-tools and disconnecting/connecting AC power will
cause this to trigger, making it a common failure scenario on laptops.
Instead of bailing out of watchdog\_disable() when !watchdog\_enabled we
can initialize the hrtimer regardless of watchdog\_enabled status. This
makes it safe to call watchdog\_disable() in the nmi\_watchdog=0 case,
without the negative effect on the enabled => disabled => enabled case.
All these tests pass with this patch:
- nmi\_watchdog=1
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi\_watchdog
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi\_watchdog
- nmi\_watchdog=0
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
- nmi\_watchdog=0
echo mem > /sys/power/state

firewire: net: Fix handling of fragmented multicast/broadcast packets.
commit 9d2373420900a39f5212a3b289331aa3535b1000 upstream.
This patch fixes both the transmit and receive portion of sending
fragmented mutlicast and broadcast packets.
The transmit section was broken because the offset for INTFRAG and
LASTFRAG packets were just miscalculated by IEEE1394\_GASP\_HDR\_SIZE (which
was reserved with skb\_push() in fwnet\_send\_packet).
The receive section was broken because in fwnet\_incoming\_packet is a call
to fwnet\_peer\_find\_by\_node\_id(). Called with generation == -1 it will
not find a peer and the partial datagrams are associated to a peer.
[Stefan R: The fix to use context->card->generation is not perfect.
It relies on the IR tasklet which processes packets from the prior bus
generation to run before the self-ID-complete worklet which sets the
current card generation. Alas, there is no simple way of a race-free
implementation. Let's do it this way for now.]

carl9170: fix -EINVAL bailout during init with !CONFIG\_MAC80211\_MESH
commit 6c653f66772c39c5e25db715bbd4730596fccd9e upstream.
Sean reported that as of 3.7, his AR9170 device no longer works
because the driver fails during initialization. He noted this
is due to:
"In carl9170/fw.c, ar->hw->wiphy is tagged with
NL80211\_IFTYPE\_MESH\_POINT support if the firmware has Content
after Beacon Queuing. This is both in interface\_modes and the
only iface\_combinations entry.
If CONFIG\_MAC80211\_MESH is not set, ieee80211\_register\_hw
removes NL80211\_IFTYPE\_MESH\_POINT from interface\_modes, but
not iface\_combinations.
wiphy\_register then checks to see if every interface type in
every interface combination is in interface\_modes.
NL80211\_IFTYPE\_MESH\_POINT was removed, so you get a WARN\_ON
warning and it returns -EINVAL, giving up."
Unfortunately, the iface\_combination (types) feature bitmap
in ieee80211\_iface\_limit is part of a const member in the
ieee80211\_iface\_combination struct. Hence, the MESH\_POINT
feature flag can't be masked by wiphy\_register in the
same way as interface\_modes in ieee80211\_register\_hw.

Commit f0425beda4d404a6e751439b562100b902ba9c98 "mac80211: retry sending
failed BAR frames later instead of tearing down aggr" caused regression
on rt2x00 hardware (connection hangs). This regression was fixed by
commit be03d4a45c09ee5100d3aaaedd087f19bc20d01 "rt2x00: Don't let
mac80211 send a BAR when an AMPDU subframe fails". But the latter
commit caused yet another problem reported in
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=42828#c22
After long discussion in this thread:
http://mid.gmane.org/20121018075615.GA18212@redhat.com
and testing various alternative solutions, which failed on one or other
setup, we have no other good fix for the issues like just revert both
mentioned earlier commits.
To do not affect other hardware which benefit from commit
f0425beda4d404a6e751439b562100b902ba9c98, instead of reverting it,
introduce flag that when used will restore mac80211 behaviour before

While AR\_PHY\_CCA\_NOM\_VAL\_\* does contain the expected internal noise floor
for a chip measured in clean air, it refers to the lowest expected reading.
Depending on the frequency, this measurement can vary by about 6db, thus
causing a higher reported channel noise and signal strength.
Factor in the 6db offset when converting internal noisefloor to channel noise.

mm: bootmem: fix free\_all\_bootmem\_core() with odd bitmap alignment
commit 10d73e655cef6e86ea8589dca3df4e495e4900b0 upstream.
Currently free\_all\_bootmem\_core ignores that node\_min\_pfn may be not
multiple of BITS\_PER\_LONG. Eg commit 6dccdcbe2c3e ("mm: bootmem: fix
checking the bitmap when finally freeing bootmem") shifts vec by lower
bits of start instead of lower bits of idx. Also
if (IS\_ALIGNED(start, BITS\_PER\_LONG) && vec == ~0UL)
assumes that vec bit 0 corresponds to start pfn, which is only true when
node\_min\_pfn is a multiple of BITS\_PER\_LONG. Also loop in the else
clause can double-free pages (e.g. with node\_min\_pfn == start == 1,
map[0] == ~0 on 32-bit machine page 32 will be double-freed).
This bug causes the following message during xtensa kernel boot:
bootmem::free\_all\_bootmem\_core nid=0 start=1 end=8000

- provide BITS\_PER\_LONG bits in vec, if those bits are available in the
map
- don't free pages past next start position in the else clause.

mm: use aligned zone start for pfn\_to\_bitidx calculation
commit c060f943d0929f3e429c5d9522290584f6281d6e upstream.
The current calculation in pfn\_to\_bitidx assumes that (pfn -
zone->zone\_start\_pfn) >> pageblock\_order will return the same bit for
all pfn in a pageblock. If zone\_start\_pfn is not aligned to
pageblock\_nr\_pages, this may not always be correct.
Consider the following with pageblock order = 10, zone start 2MB:
pfn | pfn - zone start | (pfn - zone start) >> page block order
----------------------------------------------------------------
0x26000 | 0x25e00 | 0x97
0x26100 | 0x25f00 | 0x97
0x26200 | 0x26000 | 0x98
0x26300 | 0x26100 | 0x98
This means that calling {get,set}\_pageblock\_migratetype on a single page
will not set the migratetype for the full block. Fix this by rounding
down zone\_start\_pfn when doing the bitidx calculation.
For our use case, the effects of this bug were mostly tied to the fact
that CMA allocations would either take a long time or fail to happen.
Depending on the driver using CMA, this could result in anything from
visual glitches to application failures.

mm: compaction: fix echo 1 > compact\_memory return error issue
commit 7964c06d66c76507d8b6b662bffea770c29ef0ce upstream.
when run the folloing command under shell, it will return error
sh/$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact\_memory
sh/$ sh: write error: Bad address
After strace, I found the following log:
...
write(1, "1\n", 2) = 3
write(1, "", 4294967295) = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
write(2, "echo: write error: Bad address\n", 31echo: write error: Bad address
) = 31
This tells system return 3(COMPACT\_COMPLETE) after write data to
compact\_memory.
The fix is to make the system just return 0 instead 3(COMPACT\_COMPLETE)
from sysctl\_compaction\_handler after compaction\_nodes finished.

MIPS: Fix poweroff failure when HOTPLUG\_CPU configured.

When poweroff machine, kernel\_power\_off() call disable\_nonboot\_cpus().
And if we have HOTPLUG\_CPU configured, disable\_nonboot\_cpus() is not an
empty function but attempt to actually disable the nonboot cpus. Since
system state is SYSTEM\_POWER\_OFF, play\_dead() won't be called and thus
disable\_nonboot\_cpus() hangs. Therefore, we make this patch to avoid

s390/cio: fix pgid reserved check
commit d99e79ec5574fc556c988f613ed6175f6de66f4a upstream.
The check to whom a device is reserved is done by checking the path
state of the affected channel paths. If it turns out that one path is
flagged as reserved by someone else the whole device is marked as such.
However the meaning of the RESVD\_ELSE bit is that the addressed device
is reserved to a different pathgroup (and not reserved to a different
LPAR). If we do this test on a path which is currently not a member of
the pathgroup we could erroneously mark the device as reserved to
someone else.
To fix this collect the reserved state for all potential members of the
pathgroup and only mark the device as reserved if all of those potential
members have the RESVD\_ELSE bit set.

Prior to memory slot sorting this loop compared all of the user memory
slots for overlap with new entries. With memory slot sorting, we're
just checking some number of entries in the array that may or may not
be user slots. Instead, walk all the slots with kvm\_for\_each\_memslot,
which has the added benefit of terminating early when we hit the first
empty slot, and skip comparison to private slots.

powerpc/vdso: Remove redundant locking in update\_vsyscall\_tz()
commit ce73ec6db47af84d1466402781ae0872a9e7873c upstream.
The locking in update\_vsyscall\_tz() is not only unnecessary because the vdso
code copies the data unproteced in \_\_kernel\_gettimeofday() but also
introduces a hard to reproduce race condition between update\_vsyscall()
and update\_vsyscall\_tz(), which causes user space process to loop
forever in vdso code.
The following patch removes the locking from update\_vsyscall\_tz().
Locking is not only unnecessary because the vdso code copies the data
unprotected in \_\_kernel\_gettimeofday() but also erroneous because updating
the tb\_update\_count is not atomic and introduces a hard to reproduce race
condition between update\_vsyscall() and update\_vsyscall\_tz(), which further
causes user space process to loop forever in vdso code.
The below scenario describes the race condition,
x==0 Boot CPU other CPU
proc\_P: x==0
timer interrupt
update\_vsyscall
x==1 x++;sync settimeofday
update\_vsyscall\_tz
x==2 x++;sync
x==3 sync;x++
sync;x++
proc\_P: x==3 (loops until x becomes even)
Because the ++ operator would be implemented as three instructions and not
atomic on powerpc.
A similar change was made for x86 in commit 6c260d58634

s390/kvm: Fix address space mixup
commit ce6a04ac1b759beafc88dbc443ae5da867579eeb upstream.
I was chasing down a bug of random validity intercepts on s390.
(guest prefix page not mapped in the host virtual aspace). Turns out
that the problem was a wrong address space control element. The
cause was quite complex:
During paging activity a DAT protection during SIE caused a program
interrupt. Normally, the sie retry loop tries to catch all
interrupts during and shortly before sie to rerun the setup. The
problem is now that protection causes a suppressing program interrupt,
causing the PSW to point to the instruction AFTER SIE in case of DAT
protection. This confused the logic of the retry loop to not trigger,
instead we jumped directly back to SIE after return from
the program interrupt. (the protection fault handler itself did
a rewind of the psw). This usually works quite well, but:
If now the protection fault handler has to wait, another program
might be scheduled in. Later on the sie process will be schedules
in again. In that case the content of CR1 (primary address space)
will be wrong because switch\_to will put the user space ASCE into CR1
and not the guest ASCE.
In addition the program parameter is also wrong for every protection
fault of a guest, since we dont issue the SPP instruction.
So lets also check for PSW == instruction after SIE in the program
check handler. Instead of expensively checking all program
interruption codes that might be suppressing we assume that a program
interrupt pointing after SIE was always a program interrupt in SIE.
(Otherwise we have a kernel bug anyway).
We also have to compensate the rewinding, since the C-level handlers
will do that. Therefore we need to add a nop with the same length
as SIE before the sie\_loop.

commit 87cac8f879a5ecd7109dbe688087e8810b3364eb upstream.
Newer kernels (linux-next with the transparent huge page patches)
use rrbm if the feature is announced via feature bit 66.
RRBM will cause intercepts, so KVM does not handle it right now,
causing an illegal instruction in the guest.
The easy solution is to disable the feature bit for the guest.

We know that we have issues with the fw in the reclaim path.
This is why iwl\_reclaim doesn't complain too loud when it
happens since it is recoverable. Somehow, the caller of
iwl\_reclaim however WARNed when it happens. This doesn't
make any sense.
When I digged into the history of that code, I discovered
that this bug occurs only when we receive a BA notification.
So move the W/A in the BA notification handling code where
it was before.

iwlwifi: don't handle masked interrupt
commit 25a172655f837bdb032e451f95441bb4acec51bb upstream.
This can lead to a panic if the driver isn't ready to
handle them. Since our interrupt line is shared, we can get
an interrupt at any time (and CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SHIRQ checks
that even when the interrupt is being freed).
If the op\_mode has gone away, we musn't call it. To avoid
this the transport disables the interrupts when the hw is
stopped and the op\_mode is leaving.
If there is an event that would cause an interrupt the INTA
register is updated regardless of the enablement of the
interrupts: even if the interrupts are disabled, the INTA
will be changed, but the device won't issue an interrupt.
But the ISR can be called at any time, so we ought ignore
the value in the INTA otherwise we can call the op\_mode
after it was freed.
I found this bug when the op\_mode\_start failed, and called
iwl\_trans\_stop\_hw(trans, true). Then I played with the
RFKILL button, and removed the module.
While removing the module, the IRQ is freed, and the ISR is
called (CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SHIRQ enabled). Panic.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [903967](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903967) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [928130](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=928130) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [939263](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=939263) [RESOLVED / FIXED]
