Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-2450:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `ObjectStreamClass` class in OpenJDK not properly protecting against circular references during deserialization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The primary weakness is the lack of proper handling for circular references within the `ObjectStreamClass` class when deserializing objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. The excessive processing of circular references could consume system resources, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Untrusted Java application or applet:** A malicious Java application or applet, loaded into a vulnerable Java runtime environment, could be crafted to trigger the flaw by creating circular object references that will be deserialized.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to execute untrusted Java code:** The attacker must be able to run a Java application or applet that can trigger object deserialization. This could be through a web browser loading an applet or through a Java application processing untrusted data.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Red Hat Bugzilla:** Red Hat Bugzilla entry 975141 explicitly states: "(CVE-2013-2450) OpenJDK: ObjectStreamClass circular reference denial of service (Serialization, 8000638)".
*   **OpenJDK Source Code:** The fix implemented in the OpenJDK source code (changeset 6263:285765be3123) involves adding a `HashSet` to track object names during deserialization, throwing an `InvalidClassException` if a circular reference is detected.
*   **Red Hat Security Advisories:** Red Hat Security Advisories (e.g., RHSA-2013:0957, RHSA-2013:0958, RHSA-2013:0963, etc.) mention this CVE, and provide updated packages that address this vulnerability. The vulnerability is addressed in a number of Red Hat products: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and in Red Hat Network Satellite Server.
*   **SUSE Security Update:** SUSE also issued a security update (SUSE-SU-2013:1305-1) to fix this vulnerability in IBM Java 1.6.0, indicating a widespread impact.
*   **Gentoo Security Advisory:** Gentoo's GLSA 201406-32 mentions CVE-2013-2450 in the context of multiple vulnerabilities affecting IcedTea.
*   **Oracle Security Advisory:** Oracle's Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - June 2013 includes CVE-2013-2450, describing the root cause, and recommending updating all affected versions of Java.
*   **Mageia Security Advisory:** Mageia's advisory MGASA-2013-0185 also notes the vulnerability
*   **US-CERT Alert:** The US-CERT Alert TA13-169A details the vulnerability and its impact within Oracle's Java SE framework.

**Summary:** The vulnerability in `ObjectStreamClass` is a classic example of a deserialization vulnerability that could allow an attacker to trigger a DoS by crafting specific input. The fix involves preventing the processing of circular references which could cause excessive consumption of resources and possibly a crash. The vulnerability was widespread, affecting multiple Java implementations and distributions.
