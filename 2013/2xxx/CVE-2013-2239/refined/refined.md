  "CVE-2013-2239": {
    "description": "vzkernel before 042stab080.2 in the OpenVZ modification for the Linux kernel 2.6.32 does not initialize certain length variables, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via (1) a crafted ploop driver ioctl call, related to the ploop_getdevice_ioc function in drivers/block/ploop/dev.c, or (2) a crafted quotactl system call, related to the compat_quotactl function in fs/quota/quota.c.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to missing initialization of certain length variables within the `ploop_getdevice_ioc` function in `drivers/block/ploop/dev.c` and the `compat_quotactl` function in `fs/quota/quota.c`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory Leak",
        "Information Disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "Local users can obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory due to the uninitialized length variables, leading to a loss of confidentiality.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted ploop driver ioctl call targeting the `ploop_getdevice_ioc` function",
