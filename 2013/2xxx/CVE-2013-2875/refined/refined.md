**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **iTunes:** The attacker needs to be positioned to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, intercepting and modifying traffic between the user and the iTunes Store.
- **Safari/Chromium:** The attacker only needs to host a malicious website or find a way to inject a malicious SVG file into a website a user visits.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in WebKit, which is used by multiple applications including iTunes and Safari.
- The vulnerability was discovered by miaubiz.
- The fix was implemented through improved memory handling.
