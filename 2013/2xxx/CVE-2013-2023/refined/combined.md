Hello list!

```
I want to inform you about multiple vulnerabilities in jPlayer. These are
Cross-Site Scripting and Content Spoofing and vulnerabilities in jPlayer.
Which is used at tens thousands of web sites and in multiple web
applications.
```

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

```
Vulnerable are versions before jPlayer 2.2.23. Version 2.2.23 and the last
released version 2.3.0 are not vulnerable to mentioned XSS, except CS via JS
and XSS via JS callbacks. Also there are other bypass methods which work in
version 2.3.0, but the developers haven't fixed them besides attack via
alert. About that I've wrote to developers already in March and reminded
again. So wait for new version with fixing of these vulnerabilities.
```

-------------------------
Affected vendors:

----------
Details:
----------

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

In different versions of jPlayer there are different XSS vulnerabilities.

0.2.1 - 1.2.0:

http:/site/Jplayer.swf?id=%22))}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//

2.0.0:

http:/site/Jplayer.swf?id=%27))}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//

2.1.0:

http:/site/Jplayer.swf?jQuery=)}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//

http:/site/Jplayer.swf?id=%27))}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//

```
In version 2.2.0 these XSS vulnerabilities were fixed (the developers was
informed about hole in jQuery parameter and made a fix, which protected from
both attacks). But Malte Batram (in version 2.2.19) and I (in version
2.2.20) have found new ones.
```

2.2.0 - 2.2.19 (and previous versions):

```
Attack works in Firefox (all versions and browsers on Gecko engine), IE6 and
Opera 10.62.
```

http:/site/Jplayer.swf?jQuery=document.write&id=%3Cimg%20src=1%20onerror=alertu0028document.cookieu0029%3E

2.2.20 - 2.2.22 (and previous versions):

http:/site/Jplayer.swf?jQuery=alert&id=XSS

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

```
It's possible to conduct CS (inclusion of audio/video files from external
resources) via JS and XSS via JS callbacks. This requires HTML Injection
vulnerability at the site. The attack is similar to XSS attacks via
callbacks in JW Player (<http://securityvulns.ru/docs28176.html>).
```

```
Because this attack vector requires separate vulnerability at target site to
conduct CS and XSS attacks with using of jPlayer, the developers didn't do
anything to fix it. The same as developers JW Player. So protection from
this attack scenario lies solely on web sites owners.
```

------------
Timeline:

```
------------
2013.01.31 - found vulnerabilities in jPlayer at multiple web sites (in
version 2.1.0).
```

2013.03.14 - announced at my site.
2013.03.19 - informed developers.

```
2013.03.19-30 - discussed with developers different vulnerabilities in
different versions of jPlayer and at their sites.
2013.03.21 - developers was informed by Malte Batram's about XSS hole in
2.2.19.
2013.03.21 - developers fixed Malte's XSS hole in 2.2.20 in github
(CVE-2013-1942).
```

2013.03.22 - informed developers about new hole, which works in 2.2.20.

```
2013.03.23 - sent details of new XSS and warned about possibility for other
XSS attacks and gave recommendations about proper fixing of XSS to prevent
any future XSS.
```

2013.03.30 - reminded developers about last hole.
2013.04.12 - developers fixed my XSS hole in 2.2.23 in github.

```
2013.04.20 - developers released jPlayer 2.3.0
(<http://www.jplayer.org/2.3.0/release-notes/>) and informed me.
2013.04.20 - disclosed at my site about jPlayer
(<http://websecurity.com.ua/6379/>).
2013.04.21 - tested version 2.3.0 and found that developers fixed only one
attack vector and didn't make complete fix, as I recommended in March, so I
reminded them and sent them examples of two new XSS.
```

[![@MustLive](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4093247?v=4&size=48)](/MustLive)[MustLive](https://github.com/MustLive)opened [on May 11, 2013](https://github.com/jplayer/jPlayer/issues/162#issue-14226812)

Hello Mark!

In addition to my February's letters, I'll open this issue concerning need to fix XSS vulnerability in jPlayer completely. To prevent execution of arbitrary JavaScript function via jQuery parameter. So there will no possibility to conduct XSS attacks at all, since last fix didn't fix this vulnerability completely and version 2.3.0 is still affected.

It'll be reminding for you to fix this vulnerability. All details we'll be discussing by e-mail, as we did in previous months.

My understanding of this one is that it now filters out \\ < > = which
could be previously used to insert content into the parameters passed
to the SWF file resulting in XSS.

that was probably the case, I typically assume when I assign a CVE
that the next release will assign it (because usually people do fix
things quickly =). I was going off of
<http://www.jplayer.org/latest/release-notes/> when I assigned these

Yeah, partly what happened is I was specifically asked for a cve for
jplayer by the ownCloud guys, I looked at the changelog, saw a bunch
more and assigned them as best I could.

## Description

[![@MustLive](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4093247?v=4&size=48)](/MustLive)[MustLive](https://github.com/MustLive)opened [on May 11, 2013](https://github.com/jplayer/jPlayer/issues/162#issue-14226812)

Hello Mark!

In addition to my February's letters, I'll open this issue concerning need to fix XSS vulnerability in jPlayer completely. To prevent execution of arbitrary JavaScript function via jQuery parameter. So there will no possibility to conduct XSS attacks at all, since last fix didn't fix this vulnerability completely and version 2.3.0 is still affected.

It'll be reminding for you to fix this vulnerability. All details we'll be discussing by e-mail, as we did in previous months.

Subject: Re: Re: CVE-2013-1942 jPlayer 2.2.19 XSS

Kurt,

Your CVE assignment posts from [1] and [2] appear to be inconsistent, and
there are some questions about affected versions, so I wanted to get some
clarity about which CVEs go with which issues.

1) CVE-2013-1942 - fixed in 2.2.20.
    Commit: e8ca190f7f972a6a421cb95f09e138720e40ed6d

    This one doesn't seem to have any issues.

2) CVE-2013-2022 - based on [1] CVE-2013-2022 is listed after a section
    that talks about an XSS fixed in 2.3.0 (which also includes the
    CVE-2013-1942 assignment).   However, in [2] you say "CVE-2013-2022 is
    for jPlayer 2.2.20 XSS" but <http://www.jplayer.org/2.3.0/release-notes/>
    says that CVE-2013-2022 is fixed in 2.2.23.  (Maybe when you said
    2.2.20, this also covered other unfixed versions UNTIL 2.2.23).

3) CVE-2013-2023 - in [1] you assign CVE-2013-2023 to the security fix
    that quotes the jPlayer changelog entry for 2.2.23 - which, as just
    mentioned in the previous bullet, you already described as being
    associated with CVE-2013-2022.  In [2], you also state that
    CVE-2013-2023 is for jPlayer 2.2.23 XSS.

4) There is no mention of issues that are FIXED in 2.3.0 based
    on upstream changelog, but <http://www.jplayer.org/2.4.0/release-notes/>
    lists fixes in both 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.

5) According to jPlayer release notes, we have:

    [2.3.1] Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a minor security vulnerability
    that enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Eugene Dokukin.
    Security reference CVE-2013-2023.

    [2.3.2] Security Fix: Closed Flash SWF security vulnerability that
    enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Eugene Dokukin. Security
    reference CVE-2013-2023. The jPlayer noConflict option is now
    restricted to strings that contain the term jQuery. For example:
    lib.jQuery or myjQueryRocks.

    [2.2.20] Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a security vulnerability that
    enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Malte Batram. Security
    reference CVE-2013-1942.

    [2.2.23] Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a minor security vulnerability
    that enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Eugene Dokukin.
    Security reference CVE-2013-2022.

I'm of the mindset to use the CVE assignments as provided by jQuery
upstream, but it may be good to get full clarity down to the individual
commits.

## jPlayer 2.9+ Development notes

View the [change log](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
in the [github repository](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer)
for the continued record of jPlayer development.

## jPlayer 2.8.0 Release notes

* Released: 11th November 2014
* [2.7.1] Bug Fix: Fixed the legacy Android fix to work with latest Android.
  This moved the android fix code to the `loadeddata` event
  from the `progress` event.
* [dev] Code Clean: Refactored the Flash ActionScript,
  removing the `TraceOut` class
  from the `Jplayer.as` code
  and the `happyworm` package.
* [dev] ARIA Feature: The `autoBlur` option will now either
  `blur()` or `focus()`.
  This helps maintain cross-browser behaviour when a user clicks on a GUI button.
* [dev] New Feature: Added the `noVolume` state class for when the volume controls
  are being hidden due to the `noVolume` option.
  This helps GUI design by enabling a CSS rule to hide the volume controls.
* [dev] jPlayer Repository Refactor: Added all download content to the repository and added a grunt build system.
  The example demos work within the repository, and use the built (minified) jPlayer files.
* [dev] Refactor: Renamed the SWF file from
  `Jplayer.swf`
  to `jquery.jplayer.swf`
* [dev] Refactor: The Flash `jquery.jplayer.swf` file is now compiled using the
  Flex compiler in the `grunt-mxmlc` node.js module.

## jPlayer 2.7.0 Release notes

* Released: 1st September 2014
* [2.6.1] Bug Fix: Added the `captureDuration` option (Default: true)
  to capture clicks on the duration element.
  This can help the operation of the `toggleDuration` option in some designs.
* [2.6.2] Bug Fix: The key bindings broke the accessibility of page elements that were not
  `input` or `textarea`.
  Now any element in focus will prevent the jPlayer key bindings.
  A fallback remains for old browsers without `document.activeElement` support, but this may be redundant.
  This issue was report here
  [jPlayer breaks all links on a page for keyboard users](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/issues/206)
  by [digitaltoast](https://github.com/digitaltoast).
* [dev] New Feature: The GUI interations will now `blur()` when the
  `autoBlur` option is `true` (default).
* [2.6.3] Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in the code for 2.6.2 where a test for `null` was being made incorrectly.
* [dev] New Feature: The state of jPlayer is now exposed to the GUI through applying state classes to the
  `cssSelectorAncestor` element.
  The state class names are defined in the `stateClass` option object,
  where the following states may have a class name defined:
  `playing`,
  `seeking`,
  `muted`,
  `looped` and
  `fullScreen`.
* [dev] New Feature: The `useStateClassSkin` (default: false) option
  is set to enable skins that do not have element pairs for the controls.
  These new skins types use the state classes to change the display through CSS rules.
* [dev] [jPlayerPlaylist add-on] New Feature: The `autoBlur` option of the jPlayer instance
  now affects the Playlist GUI controls.
* [dev] [jPlayerPlaylist add-on] New Feature: The `useStateClassSkin` option of the jPlayer instance
  now affects the Playlist GUI controls through the `stateClass` option
  for `shuffled` class name.
* [dev] [jPlayerPlaylist add-on] New Feature: The `autoBlur` option of the jPlayer instance
  now affects the Playlist track selection.
* [dev] [jPlayerPlaylist add-on] New Feature: The track selection link had its `tabindex` changed from
  `tabindex="1"` to `tabindex="0"`.
* [dev] [jPlayerPlaylist add-on] New Feature: The free download link had its `tabindex` changed from
  `tabindex="1"` to `tabindex="-1"`.
* [2.6.4] Bug Fix: Removed the codecs part from the canPlayType test for MP3.
  This bug affected Win/OSX Chrome and Android Chrome and Firefox.

## jPlayer 2.6.0 Release notes

* Released: 2nd April 2014
* [2.5.1] Bug Fix: Links in the `.jp-no-solution` element were not working.
  The empty click handler was capturing and preventing the click on the link.
  Changed the `cssSelector` code so the GUI elements that do not have a user action,
  do not longer require an empty function. This removes a number of empty internal functions.
  This issue was report here
  [Cannot click links in .jp-no-solution](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/179)
  by [robballou](https://github.com/robballou).
* [2.5.2] Bug Fix: Added to the Flash MP3 solution the
  `loadedmetadata` and
  `durationchange` events.
  This is important for the jplayer Popcorn Player Plugin working with MP3 and IE8.
* [2.5.3] Bug Fix: Corrected the checks for a `console.log()` feature.
* [2.5.4] Bug Fix: Check that media formats contain a truethy `url`
  value before attempting to convert them to absolute URLs.
  The [jPlayer.inspector](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer.injector) project highlighted this problem.
* [2.5.5] Bug Fix: Applied a fix for Android when changing audio and immediately playing.
  After `setMedia()` to an audio media type, any immediate
  `play()`,
  `play(time)` or
  `pause(time)`
  commands are delayed until the first `progress` event.
* [dev] New Feature: The `media.title`
  property of the `setMedia` object
  is now written to the `jp-title` class of the instance.
  It is also written to the HTML Media element's `title` attribue.
  This should now display in the iOS Control Center.
  However, we found and reported a bug in the iOS7.1 system for audio elements and
  for the time being, this will only work with video elements.
* [dev] New Feature: The duration display may now show the time remaining using the
  `remainingDuration` option.
  The `toggleDuration` option may be used to enable clicks on the duration
  to toggle the `remainingDuration` option.
* [dev] New Feature: A new `$.jPlayer.event.setmedia` event
  has been added that fires when jPlayer is issued a `setMedia` comand.
  (The jPlayer.inspector was updated to include this event.)
* [dev] Refactor: The `currentTime` and `duration`
  GUI display elements will only be written to if their display value has changed.
  This may help Chrome, which has issues capturing clicks on the text if it is being changed.
* [dev] New Feature: The `media.duration`
  property of the `setMedia` object
  is now used when displaying the `jp-duration`.
  When `undefined`, the values are taken from the media.
  When a `string`, the string is used.
  When a `number` (in seconds), the displayed values are calculated using this number.
  Internally, the values on the status are always taken from the media.
* [2.5.6] Bug Fix: The `destroy` command now removes the full screen event handlers.

## jPlayer 2.5.0 Release notes

* Released: 7th November 2013
* [2.4.1] Bug Fix: The Flash SWF had a problem with more than 8 instances on OSX with Firefox and Safari.
  This was due to the `TraceOut()` class being instanced.
  The class is now only instanced in debug mode.
* [dev] New Feature: Added the `consoleAlerts` option (default:true) which forces
  the alerts generated by `errorAlerts` and `warningAlerts`
  to be written to the console instead.
  When the console is not supported and this option is enabled, no alert will occur.
  This feature was proposed here
  [Added an option for console logging errors...](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/173)
  by [adamwaite](https://github.com/adamwaite).
* [2.4.2] Bug Fix: The Flash SWF had a problem with relative URLs when using the MP4 player (m4a/m4v).
  Now all media URLs are converted to absolute URLs.
  The converted URLs are stored in the `event.jPlayer.status.media` object, even if you supplied relative URLs.
* [dev] Added Support: Merged Pull Request [m3u8 support](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/142)
  by [rickvanderzwet](https://github.com/rickvanderzwet).
  Edited to create the audio `m3u8a` and video `m3u8v` format definitions.
  Be aware that, only a few HTML browsers support this format and the Flash does not support it.
* [dev] Added Support: For the M3U format by creating the
  audio `m3ua` and video `m3uv` format definitions.
  Be aware that, only a few HTML browsers support this format and the Flash does not support it.
* [dev] Added Support: Merged Pull Request [Add opus codec for ogg, add flac](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/103)
  by [StefanBruens](https://github.com/StefanBruens).
* [dev] New Feature: Added `tellOthers(command[,conditions][,args])` method.
  This method enables an instance to issue commands to the other instances.
  The optional `conditions(invoker)` function executes with
  the other instance's context (`this`) and
  returns `true` or `false`,
  controlling whether the other instance is commanded.
  The `invoker` parameter is the jPlayer instance that is issuing the commands.
  Both `this` and `invoker` are the jPlayer JavaScript object.
  For example: `this.status.srcSet` or
  `invoker.options.muted`.
* [dev] New Feature: Added `time` parameter to `pauseOthers(time)` method.
  This feature was proposed here
  [Added stopOthers similar to pauseOthers](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/139)
  by [harvest](https://github.com/harvest).
* [dev] New Feature: Added the `globalVolume` option (default:false) which causes
  the `volume` option to be shared with other jPlayer instances
  that have the `globalVolume` option enabled.
* [dev] New Feature: Enhanced the `globalVolume` option to causes
  the `muted` option to be shared with other jPlayer instances
  that have the `globalVolume` option enabled.
* [dev] [Bower](http://bower.io/) Support:
  Added `bower.json` file to the jPlayer Repository.
  This addition was proposed here
  [bower component file](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/132)
  by [popol1991](https://github.com/popol1991).
* [dev] Added Support: Added the `allowInsecureDomain("*")` command to the Flash.
  This addition was proposed here
  [Use allowInsecureDomain in order to support serving the SWF over HTTPS](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/130)
  by [prekageo](https://github.com/prekageo).
* [dev] Added Support: The Flash RTMP player now supports an Amazon CloudFront Signature URL.
  This addition was proposed here
  [Update JplayerRtmp.as](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/161)
  by [iking0980](https://github.com/iking0980).
* [dev] Bug Fix: The volume was not restored after a `flashreset` event.
  This fix was given here
  [Recovering from "flash reset" does not restore volume](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/52)
  by [marcn](https://github.com/marcn).
* [dev] New Feature: Added the `playbackRate` option for the HTML solution.
  This option works with these other options:
  `defaultPlaybackRate`,
  `minPlaybackRate` and
  `maxPlaybackRate`.
  The GUI cssSelectors have been added for a control bar.
  The status object has the `status.playbackRateEnabled` flag to indicate support.
  This feature varies cross-browser, see the dev guide for more information.

## jPlayer 2.4.0 Release notes

* Released: 5th June 2013
* [2.3.1] Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a minor security vulnerability that enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting).
  Reported by Eugene Dokukin.
  Security reference [CVE-2013-2023](http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cve.html).
* [2.3.2] Security Fix: Closed Flash SWF security vulnerability that enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting).
  Reported by Eugene Dokukin.
  Security reference [CVE-2013-2023](http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cve.html).
  The jPlayer `noConflict` option is now restricted to strings that contain the term `jQuery`.

  For example: `lib.jQuery` or `myjQueryRocks`.
* [2.3.3] Bug Fix: Added the following event emulation to the Flash MP3 player:
  `playing`,
  `waiting`,
  `canplay` and
  `canplaythrough`.
* [2.3.4] Bug Fix: In the Flash MP3 player, cleared the `waiting` event timer on `setMedia`.
  Thus fixing erroneous `waiting` event generation when `setMedia`, then `play`, then `setMedia`.
* [2.3.5] Bug Fix: The links in the Flash Context Menu (right click menu) now work.
  The Flash plugin has a bug with context menus over a video player, so a transparent Sprite was put over it.
* [2.3.6] Bug Fix: Changing the `cssSelectorAncestor` after instancing now updates the GUI to the current state.
  Bug reported by [kusch](https://github.com/kusch) in [Issue #83](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/issues/83).
* [2.3.7] Bug Fix: Corrected the GUI bars click handlers so only a single event is processed.
  Affected the play and volume bars when decreasing the value.
  ie., The click was captured by both the playBar and the seekBar as the event propagated up the DOM.
  (Introduced by the 2.2.21 change.)
* [2.3.8] New Feature: Added support for Zepto 1.0 compiled with optional data module.
  You will need to manually edit the code to enable Zepto.
  It requires switching in/out the jQuery and Zepto lines of code at the start.
  Submitted by [nuria](https://github.com/nuria).
* [2.3.9] Bug Fix: Multiple GUI bars are now enabled.
  The click events are now handled by the bar container, `seekBar` or `volumeBar`,
  and the click refers to itself through the `event.currentTarget`.
* [2.3.10] Feature Change: Zepto support is now automatic, except when used as an AMD module.
  The AMD module continues to require the manual code change for the AMD dependency.
* [2.3.11] Code Review: Updated versioning to 2.4.0.
  Final check on [jshint.com](http://jshint.com).
  Created and tested minified JavaScript.

## jPlayer 2.3.0 Release notes

* Released: 20th April 2013
* [2.2.1] Merged Pull Request: [Review time problems](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/75)
  by [Tolia](https://github.com/Tolia).
  If there is an hours time value, then the hours are automatically added to the minutes when the showHour option is false.
  Details in [Issue #69](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/issues/69).
* [2.2.2] Reviewed Pull Request of [2.2.1]
  Implemented the same scheme for seconds, where the hours and minutes get added on if they are not being shown.
  Removed the requirement that the unit is > 0 to be displayed.
  The show options continue to directly control whether that unit is displayed.
  The input parameter is now checked that it is truethy and number type, otherwise zero is used.
* [2.2.3] Merged Pull Request: [DRYed up event settings](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/74)
  by [FarSeeing](https://github.com/FarSeeing).
  The source and minified code is reduced in size as a result of the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) change.
  No functional effect.
* [2.2.4] (Manually) Merged Pull Request: [Fix for IE bug when using tabkey to access the player/document](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/81)
  by [micha149](https://github.com/micha149).
  Added `tabindex="-1"` to the object element used by the Flash solution.
* [2.2.5] Merged Pull Request: [Support AMD](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/92)
  by [ryanramage](https://github.com/ryanramage).
  Added AMD support so jPlayer is easy to use with jamjs.
  The [jPlayer Package](http://jamjs.org/packages/#/details/jplayer) on [jamjs.org](http://jamjs.org/).
  Updated version numbers of package details to jPlayer 2.2.5. (Will update for 2.3.0 release.)
* [2.2.6] Bug Fix: IE9 and iOS6 now work with setMedia followed by play(time).
  Previously, IE9 would jump to time, but not actually play,
  and iOS would ignore the play(time) and play() from the start.
* [2.2.7] Bug Fix: Added document mode sniffer to fix Internet Explorer Flash insertion on IE9.
  Sniffer based on [Microsoft Library code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx#GetMode).
  For example, when the following HTML is used to force IE version emulation:
  `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=7" />`
* [2.2.8] Bug Fix: IE9 no longer requests the current page url on `clearMedia`.
  Solution from GitHub issue [clearMedia makes extraneous HTTP request](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/issues/56)
  by [marcn](https://github.com/marcn).
* [2.2.9] Bug Fix: The Flash Plugin Version Sniffer now checks for Flash 10.1.
* [2.2.9] Code Review: The Flash Plugin Version Sniffer code is now influenced by [SWFObject 2.2](https://code.google.com/p/swfobject/).
  This enables the granular check of the plugin version using `_checkForFlash(version)`
  where `version` is a string with the form `"1.2.3"`,
  `"1.2"`, `"1"`
  or a number `1.2`.
* [2.2.10] New Feature: Added `<track>` support to `setMedia` ready for when HTML5 browsers implement the feature.
  This follows the [W3C Media Element Living Standard](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html#timed-text-tracks)
  and the [WebVTT Living Standard](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/) as of 1st November 2012.
  A polyfill will be needed to enable this feature in the meantime and for the Flash solution.
  Could possibly use the WebVTT polyfill in [Playr](http://www.delphiki.com/html5/playr/).
* [2.2.11] Option Review: Added `iemobile: /iemobile/` to `noVolume` and `noFullScreen` blocklist option objects.
* [2.2.12] Code Review: Refactored `_checkForFlash(version)` to use code prior to 2.2.9 with changes to enable `major.minor` version number.
  The `version` is a number `1.2`.
  This satisfies the need to check for Flash 10.1 while saving over 1k bytes when compared to the 2.2.9 change.
* [2.2.13] Development Bug fix: Removed reserved word usage `default`, added in 2.2.10, and made [jshint.com](http://www.jshint.com/) pass with our options.
* [2.2.14] Feature Change: Renamed options `fullScreen` to `fullWindow`
  and `noFullScreen` to `noFullWindow`.
* [2.2.14] New Feature: Enabled HTML5 native `fullScreen` mode.
  Desktop functionality verified with Firefox 16, Safari 5.1, Chrome 23 and Opera 12.10.
  Mobile functionality verified with iOS6 (iPad3) Mobile Safari and Android 4.2 (Nexus 7) Chrome.
* [2.2.15] Bug Fix: Corrected `noFullWindow` regular expressions
  for `msie`, `ipad` and
  `android_pad`. For example, IE10 now allows full window.
* [2.2.16] (Implemented) Pull Request: [Be able to define the time format on each jPlayer instance](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/109)
  by [LeResKP](https://github.com/LeResKP).
  Functionality of request enabled while maintaining the original method
  `$.jPlayer.convertTime(s)` and the
  `$.jPlayer.timeFormat` options.
* [2.2.17] New Feature: Added keyboard controls that effect the jPlayer instance in focus.
  The last instance played has focus, or the first instanced with the feature enabled.
  The option `keyEnabled` (default: false) is used to turn the feature on.
  The option `keyBindings` is an object used to define actions with their key and function.
  The option `audioFullScreen` (default: false) allows key controls to display audio poster images in full screen, which is useful for media players.
  eg., A player that has both video and audio media in a playlist.
  The method `jPlayer("focus")` may be used on an instance to gain focus without playing.
* [2.2.18] (Manually) Merged Pull Request: [Fix issues with incorrect RTMP video size](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/131)
  by [danbrianwhite](https://github.com/danbrianwhite).
  The solution was similar to [Fix for RTMP videos not sizing properly](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/98)
  by [davidortinau](https://github.com/davidortinau).
  Both the original pull requests were 100% file differences.
  Investigated and found that JplayerRtmp.as had the incorrect line ending format.
  It had MAC format on a Windows machine, then GitBash assumed Windows format.
  This has been corrected and the change highlighted to preserve GitHub commit history visibility.
* [2.2.19] New Feature: The `videoWidth` and `videoHeight` information is now maintained on the `status`.
  These are the intrinsic width and height values of the video in pixels.
  The default is zero before it is known or if it is audio media.
* [jPlayerPlaylist 2.2.0 add-on] Merged Pull Request: [Use .on() and .off() instead of .live() and .die()](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/126)
  by [bistory](https://github.com/bistory).
  The playlist add-on is now using `.on()` and `.off()`
  instead of the deprecated `.live()` and `.die()` jQuery methods.
  The add-on now requires jQuery 1.7+ and enables jQuery 1.9+ which dropped support of the deprecated code.
* [jPlayerPlaylist 2.2.1 add-on] New Feature: Added default `keyBindings` options
  that enable next/previous track through the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.
* [jPlayerPlaylist 2.2.2 add-on] Code Review: Updated [jshint.com](http://jshint.com) options
  to those used by jPlayer and made it pass.
* [2.2.20] Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a security vulnerability that enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting).
  Reported by Malte Batram.
  Security reference [CVE-2013-1942](http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cve.html).
* [2.2.21] Bug Fix: The GUI's `cssSelector` elements click propagation was being disabled due to using `return false;`.
  Corrected to use `event.preventDefault();`.
* [2.2.22] New Feature: Added the `smoothPlayBar` option (Default: true),
  which enables the animation of the play bar. Changes to its value are now animated over 250ms in a linear manner.
* [2.2.23] Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a minor security vulnerability that enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting).
  Reported by Eugene Dokukin.
  Security reference [CVE-2013-2022](http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cve.html).
* [2.2.24] Development Default Change: The `smoothPlayBar` option (Default: false),
  had its default value changed from true to false.
* [2.2.25] Code Review: Updated versioning to 2.3.0.
  Final check on [jshint.com](http://jshint.com).
  Created and tested minified JavaScript.

## jPlayer 2.2.0 Release notes

* Released: 13th September 2012
* [2.1.1] New Feature: Added RTMP support to the Flash fallback.
  Enables the supplied options: `rtmpv` and `rtmpa` for video and media RTMP streams respectively.
  RTMP feature developed by [Robert M. Hall](http://www.impossibilities.com/) in this GitHub fork [github.com/rmhall/jPlayer](https://github.com/rmhall/jPlayer) of jPlayer.
* [2.1.2] Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a security vulnerability that could be exploited to steal cookies from the domain hosting the SWF.
  Reported by [Jason Calvert](http://appsec.ws/).
* [2.1.2] New Feature: The Flash SWF jPlayer version number is once again displayed when visiting the URL directly.
* [2.1.3] Bug Fix: Affecting iOS and Blackberry.
  iOS 5.1 sometimes fails to give the `media.duration` and it remains a NaN.
  Blackberry OS7 gives the initial `media.duration` as `Infinity`.
  jPlayer now leaves the `status.duration` at zero until the `media.duration` is finite.
* [2.1.4] Bug Fix: The RTMP solution locked up when the `stop` button/command was used, and when the progress bar was used while paused.
  Both issues were related to `pause(time)` causing a locked-up state.
* [2.1.4] Bug Fix: The RTMP solution generated the `progress` event forever.
  The `timeupdate` event now only occurs while playing. ie., It used to happen during the locked-up state.
* [2.1.5] jQuery: The `jQuery.browser` sniffer is deprecated in jQuery and will be removed in the future.
  All browser sniffing now uses code internal to jPlayer. ie., `jQuery.jPlayer.browser`
* [2.1.6] Bug Fix: The CSS skins were changed to work with Popcorn.
  The `position:relative;` rule was removed from the container as this corrupted popcorn plugin placement over the video.
  Negative margins have been used instead to align video play button.
  As a result, the video play button graphic is now the active area for clicks.

## jPlayer 2.1.0 Release notes

* Released: 1st September 2011
* [2.0.1] Bug Fix: The warning alerts are now controlled by `warningAlerts` instead of incorrectly by the `errorAlerts` setting.
* [2.0.1] Bug Fix: The css selectors are now associated before the Flash is inserted. Previously, any `warningAlerts` would interfere with the Flash ready event, causing it not to occur.
* [2.0.1] Bug Fix: The data structure is now complete before any event is generated. Previously, the `gate` and `active` properties were undefined. Affected the `NO_SOLUTION` error event.
* [2.0.2] Bug Fix: The jPlayer `ready` event now only ever occurs once. Previously, using `setMedia` in the jPlayer `ready` event when the Flash solution was being used, would generate an extra `ready` event.
* [2.0.3] Bug Fix: The jQuery UI widget.bridge code contained both the original line (now removed) and the line edited for jPlayer's use.
* [2.0.3] Feature Change: jPlayer's size is no longer read from the CSS. This was due to jQuery returning the value in pixels rather than the CSS definition, such as "100%".
* [2.0.3] New Feature: Enabled changing the video size.
  The full/restore screen sizes are set through the options: `size` and `sizeFull`, both being objects containing: `width`, `height` and `cssClass`.
  The `cssSelectorAncestor` determines the element that the `cssClass` is switched onto.
  The option `fullScreen` determines which setting is used.
  Added default values for the HTML css selectors `restoreScreen` and `fullScreen`, along with their methods.
* [2.0.3] Default Value Change: `cssSelectorAncestor` default value changed to "#jp\_container\_1" from "#jp\_interface\_1".
* [2.0.4] Code Review: Consolidated code to use the \_cssSelectorAncestor() function. Added warning event with type `CSS_SELECTOR_COUNT` if ancestor not found.
* [2.0.5] Feature Change: The `volume` and `muted` options are now maintained on the options object. The duplicate status object properties have been removed. These options can now be changed through the option method. The options object has been added to the jPlayer event object.
* [2.0.5] New Feature: The `mute()` and `unmute()` methods now have an optional parameter. The default is true, and sending a false value performs the opposite effect. Eg., mute(false) is the same as unmute(), which both set muted to false.
* [2.0.5] Bug Fix: An initial `muted` value of true now correctly displays the volume bar at zero.
* [2.0.6] New Feature: Added Flash `wmode` option (default:"window") to constructor options. Valid wmode values: window, transparent, opaque, direct, gpu
* [2.0.6] Feature Change: The Flash is now 1px by 1px during initialization, if it is used. The ready event internally minimizes it to zero size. IE6-IE8 are not effected and the size is zero during init.
* [2.0.6] Code Review: The Flash insertion code is now influenced by [SWFObject 2.2](https://code.google.com/p/swfobject/), instead of an older version.
* [2.0.7] Bug Fix: The duration is now correct in iOS Safari when the media changes. The actual bug is in iOS 4.2.1, where the durationchange event occurs while the media.duration is obsolete.
* [2.0.8] IE9 Review: Enabled the Flash solution in IE9. (Previously the IE9 beta had failed to work with ExternalInterface, so it was disabled completely.) Removed the try/catch around media.load(), which was required for IE9 beta. Removed IE9 specific clause in clearMedia.
* [2.0.9] New Feature: Added `noConflict` option (default:"jQuery") for use with `jQuery.noConflict(true)`.
* [2.0.10] New Feature: Added `emulateHtml` option (default:false), which creates a bridge that emulates the HTML5 media properties, methods and events on the jPlayer DOM element.
  This works with both HTML and Flash solutions. Properties are read-only. Known conflict with `readyState` property on IE9.
* [2.0.11] Bug Fix: `jPlayer("destroy")` now works with empty strings (and unfound selectors) in the `cssSelector` control association object.
* [2.0.12] Bug Fix: Using `jPlayer("play",time)` or `jPlayer("pause",time)` on broken media URLs when using the HTML solution caused the broken URL to be polled.
  The internal HTML error event handler now cancels any delayed commands.
* [2.0.13] New Feature: Added `flv` and `fla` support to the `supplied` formats. This makes using these formats more flexible and robust, rather than fooling jPlayer into playing the Flash FLV format through the `m4v` and `m4a` formats and setting `{solution:"flash"}`.
* [2.0.14] New Feature: Added `$.jPlayer.platform` object for detecting mobile and tablet devices.
* [2.0.15] Code Review: Verified JavaScript using [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/). Minor code syntax changes. Added JSHint options to source. All code will be reviewed in future before commiting to GitHub.
* [2.0.16] Development Bug Fix: The `cssSelector` controls `restoreScreen` and `fullScreen` now show their correct state.
* [2.0.17] New Feature: When the Flash solution has its CSS set to `display:none` and is then shown again, jPlayer will now setup the Flash from the current status state.
  This is primarily for solving a problem with the Full Screen system on Firefox, where `position:fixed` causes the Flash to reset.
  This issue does not affect IE6+ at all. Chrome, Safari and Opera are affected by the `display:none` issue. Firefox is affected by both.
* [2.0.17] New Feature: To aid with the `display:none` issue, new events and error codes have been added.
  When the Flash generates any additional ready events. the `$.jPlayer.event.flashreset` event occurs after attempting to setup the Flash with the current status.
  The error type `$.jPlayer.error.FLASH_DISABLED` occurs if any command is given to jPlayer while the Flash is hidden or disabled by the browser.
* [2.0.18] Feature Change: Changed the way the volume controls work.
  Clicks on the volume bar now unmute if the volume was muted along with changing the volume.
  Added a new `cssSelector` control `volumeMax` (default: ".jp-volume-max") and its method, which unmutes and sets the volume to max.
  The `volumechange` event is now generated from the HTML media element's event or emulated through JavaScript for the Flash.
  The volume fix for Chrome 4 was retested and found to be unneccessary. It has been removed to enable the volumechange event to be used on the HTML element.
* [2.0.19] New Feature: Implemented autohide for the control interface.
  Added the option `autohide`, an object with properties: restored, full, fadeIn, fadeOut and hold.
  Added the `cssSelector` entity `gui` (default: ".jp-gui").
  Changed default of the `wmode` option to "opaque". Changed default of `sizeFull:{height:"100%"}`
  Added `$.jPlayer.event.resize` event for when screen state changes or when size options change.
* [2.0.20] New Feature: Implemented the repeat control interface.
  Added the `loop` option (default: false) to determine initial state off loop.
  Added the `repeat` option, which defaults to the `repeat` event handler for repeating a single piece of media.
  Added `cssSelectors`: `repeat` (default: ".jp-repeat") and `repeatOff` (default: ".jp-repeat-off").
  Added the `$.jPlayer.event.repeat` event that occurs when the repeat state is changed and immediately before the ready event.
* [2.0.20] Development Bug Fix: Renamed the `cssSelector`: interface (".jp-interface") to `gui` (default: ".jp-gui").
* [2.0.21] Bug Fix: Corrected the auto ID creation of the jPlayer div ID to work with jQuery 1.6+.
  The original strict condition check on the `jQuery.attr("id")` has been changed to a falsy check.
* [2.0.22] Development Bug Fix: Corrected the GUI display when changing screen mode during a GUI fade out.
* [2.0.23] Bug Fix: The instance is now correctly removed from the instances static object in the `destroy` method.
* [2.0.24] New Feature: Added the `nativeVideoControls` blocklist option, which is an object containing user agent regular expressions. The native controls are used if matched.
  Native video controls are disabled when audio media is supplied and `noFullScreen` is set if `nativeVideoControls` found a matched.
* [2.0.24] New Feature: Added the `noFullScreen` blocklist option, which is an object containing user agent regular expressions. The full screen buttons are hidden if matched.
* [2.0.24] New Feature: Added the `noVolume` blocklist option, which is an object containing user agent regular expressions. The volume controls are hidden if matched.
* [2.0.24] Feature Change: The `setMedia` method no longer performs a clearMedia command before setting up the new media.
* [2.0.24] Development Bug Fix: The `destroy` method removes the `size:{cssClass}` from the `cssSelectorAncestor`.
* [2.0.25] Bug Fix: IE9 on Win Server 2008 has the `media.canPlayType` property, but did not implement the function. The `canPlayType()` method is now tested in a try/catch before using it. If the test fails, the HTML solution will not be used.
* [2.0.26] Bug Fix: Fixed the Flash fallback, where a `timeupdate` event was generated by all `pause` commands.
  Now a `pause()` only generates a `timeupdate` event if the media was playing.
  If paused, a `pause(time)` only generates a `timeupdate` event if the time changed.
  This fix eliminates possible `timeupdate` handler recusion loops if `pause` is used in the handler.
* [2.0.26] Feature Change: Enabled video smoothing in the Flash fallback.
* [2.0.26] Feature Change: Reduced `timeupdate` and `progress` event frequency to 4Hz in the Flash fallback. This now matches the HTML event frequency more closely.
* [2.0.27] Bug Fix: The `destroy` method now does a `clearMedia`. This stops downloads from streams persisting on some browsers.
* [2.0.28] New Feature: The `swfPath` option can now be a URL (or a path) to the SWF file with extension `.swf`. For example, `{swfPath:"/scripts/banana.swf"}` where you renamed the Jplayer.swf file to "banana.swf".
* [2.0.29] New Feature: Added the `$.jPlayer.event.click` event that detects clicks over the poster image, the HTML video and the Flash video.
  While the event works well, on some browsers the transparent layers of the GUI in full screen mode stop this from working as hoped.
  As in, the GUI needs to auto-hide and then the clicks can be captured. A different skin could be made to work fine though.
* [2.0.30] Development Bug Fix: Changing the `size` and `sizeFull` options of the audio player using the Flash fallback no longer resizes the zero sized flash as well. Also affected the Flash video solution when the poster was still being displayed.
* [2.0.30] Development Bug Fix: The audio player with Flash fallback now recovers after the first error event when it is hidden using `display:none` and then shown, or when `display:fixed` in Firefox through the full-screen button of a media player.
* [2.0.31] New Feature: Added the `cssSelector` entity `noSolution` (default:".jp-no-solution"), to enable an error message when a `NO_SOLUTION` error occurs.
* [2.0.32] AS3 Code Review: Corrected a few minor variable type declarations that were missing and not reported by the compiler. No effect, just better AS3 code.
* [2.0.32] New Feature: Customized the Flash ContextMenu. Hid the default items and added jPlayer and its Flash version to the menu.
  The custom menu items have links, but they do not function. Investigation found that the way the Flash is inserted in the page is causing the problem.
  No solution was found... But it is not important.
* [2.0.32] AS3 Compiler Change: From now on, the [Flex](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/) open-source compiler will be used to compile the Flash. Currently using the latest version, Flex 4.5.1.
* [2.0.33] Bug Fix: Identical consecutive poster image relative URLs were not being shown in OSX Safari.
  Normally only noticed when audio posters were used, as tracks often share the same poster.
  The img.src was always converted to absolute, so comparison failed.
  Solved by comparing with status.media.poster URL.
* [2.0.33] Development Default Value Change: noFullScreen blocklist defaults changed. Version check of iPad changed to iOS4 and below. Version check removed from: iPhone, iPod and Android phones.
* [2.0.33] Development Default Value Change: noVolume blocklist defaults changed. Version check removed from: iPad, iPhone, iPod and Android devices.
* [2.0.34] New Feature: Added the `verticalVolume` option (default: false) to change the volume display and click calculations from horizontal to vertical.
* [2.0.35] Development Bug Fix: Fixed GUI animation bug when changing from full-screen to restore-screen.
  A restore/full screen during the GUI fadeIn period caused the other screen state's GUI to hide, even when its options should not be hiding the GUI in that screen state.
* [2.0.36] Development Feature Change: Changed `$.jPlayer.platform` object (Added in [2.0.14]) to enable dot notation on platforms with a space in their name.
  Whitespace is replaced with underscores. ie., "windows ce" is now "windows\_ce".
* [2.1.0] Bug Fix: When a broken link error occurred in the Flash MP3 player, the `progress` and `timeupdate` events were still being generated.
  The video play button was always being displayed when the error occurred, if present, where it should not be for the mp3 format.
  The play/pause butttons on the GUI are now correctly reset to the 'paused' state. ie., showing the play button.
  (NB: The Flash MP4 player did not have this issue.)

### jPlayer 2.0.0 Release notes

* Released: 20th December 2010
* Initial release of jPlayer 2, the jQuery media player plugin. A complete code rewrite.
* New feature: Added support for video, making jPlayer capable of playing both media types.
* New feature: HTML and Flash priority is now defined by solution option. Media format priority is defined by the supplied option
* New feature: jPlayer now generates events that you can bind handlers to. The ready, error and warning events along with full support for HTML media events generated by the browser. The Flash fallback has a reduced set of events, but covers a good range for an initial release.
* New feature: Upgraded instancing code to jQuery UI 1.8.7 core widget code.

### jPlayer 1.2.0 Release notes

* Released: 11th July 2010
* Major Bug: Fixed the operation of jPlayer on the iPad. The solution also fixed the Safari 4/5 (Mac/PC) problems with multiple instances on the same page. Solution uses a single `<audio>` element per jPlayer, that is re-used and is no longer replaced each time `setFile` is issued.
* Major Bug: Corrected the use of `playHead` and `playHeadTime` immediately after `setFile`, where the src of the audio element was never being set. Also had to correct an issue specific to Opera 10.53, where using `playHead` immediately after `setFile` was causing NaN values and corrupting the audio element.
* Minor Bug: Made the play ID's CSS display type set the default display type for both play and pause IDs. The pause ID can now be set to `{display:none;}` in the CSS. This stops the pause button being displayed briefly when the page loads. If you need different display types for play and pause, then set the cssId for play first, followed by setting pause.
* Minor Bug: The internally delayed commands created by using `playHead`, `playHeadTime` or `stop` immediately after a `setFile` when the browser is using HTML5 native audio, are now cleared when issuing a `setFile`, `pause` or `stop` command. Eliminates chained commands from generating unexpected results.
* Minor Bug: Fixed the `volume` command for Chrome 4, where it was not working when used between the `setFile` and `play` commands. Also fixed when setting the volume multiple times to the same value during the condition.
* New feature: Changed the security settings of the Flash SWF using `System.security.allowDomain('*')`. This change allows cross-domain access of the SWF file and enables HTML to remote SWF scripting.
* New feature: Enabled preloading of the audio file using a new `preload` constructor option. Default is `{preload:'none'}`. Options from HTML5 Draft Spec are: none, metadata, auto.
* New feature: Added a new jPlayer method `jPlayer('load')` to preload the current audio file.

### jPlayer 1.1.1 Release notes

* Released: 29th April 2010
* New feature: The click handlers created by `jPlayer("cssId",fn,id)` now issues a `jQuery.blur()` to the id that was clicked. This also affects the default cssIds, which use this function internally. This was added so that a link anchor `<a>` or form elements `<input>` and `<button>` would lose focus after being clicked on. ie., otherwise some browsers would highlight it until the user clicked elsewhere on the page.
* Supporting Skin: The standard skin structure has been revised for accessibility. Added `tabindex` to the recommended HTML structure and changed controlling elements to `<a>`. This does not effect jPlayer directly, but since the default skin is widely used, we are mentioning it here in these notes.

### jPlayer 1.1.0 Release notes

* Released: 26th March 2010
* Fixed major bug: Changed the HTML5 native audio coding so that it works on Opera 10.51. jPlayer now uses the `Audio()` object, which replaces the old method of inserting an `<audio>` tag into the page.
* Fixed major bug: Reviewed the `HTMLAudioElement.buffered` coding so that it conforms with the current HTML5 Draft Spec. This fixes an issue in Opera 10.51, where the `buffered` property is being set to a `TimeRanges` object, but it is not actually being updated by the browser.
* Fixed minor bug: The initial volume on Chrome 4 was not being set. This had also affected changing the track through `jPlayer("setFile",mp3[,ogg])`. Both issues are now fixed.
* Fixed minor bug: When using jPlayer on secure https URLs the Internet Explorer browser was giving a non secured element warning. This issue has been fixed.
* Fixed minor bug: Corrected the HTML5 behaviour to match the Flash behaviour so that commands affecting playback are ignored before a `jPlayer("setFile",mp3[,ogg])` command is issued.
* Fixed minor bug: The volume is now limited between 0 and 100 percent. Affects the constructor option `{volume:percent}` and the method `jPlayer("volume",percent)`.
* Fixed minor bug: The `jPlayer("setFile",mp3[,ogg])` command now clears the internal controller on HTML5 browsers.
* Fixed minor bug: The internally delayed commands created by using `playHead`, `playHeadTime` or `stop` immediately after a `setFile` when the browser is using HTML5 native audio, are now cleared before delaying a new command. Issuing a `play` command clears the delayed command.
* New feature: Added the `jPlayer("clearFile")` command, which enables clearing the current audio file and disabling the playback commands.
* New feature: Added JavaScript and Flash SWF file version check. Added internal variables: `version`, `swfVersionRequired` and `swfVersion`. The jPlayer version text has been added to the SWF file, so direct viewing of the SWF shows its version. Check failure will create an alert if `{errorAlerts:true}`, but no other action is taken.

### jPlayer 1.0.0 Release notes

* Released: 18th February 2010
* Fixed major Bug: All calls to jPlayer are now passed through a single plugin method called `jPlayer()`. This breaks backwards compatibility and developers are advised to review the new documentation for the new control mechanism.
* Fixed major bug: Fixed the problem where some browsers were not always detecting the end of the MP3 file in Flash. Used the Flash `Sound.onSoundComplete` to raise a flag, which is then captured by the `progressBroker()`. The values affected by the inaccurate `Sound.position` property are forced to their correct values. (Affects: playedTime, playedPercentRelative and playedPercentAbsolute.)
* Fixed major bug: Using `playHead`, `playHeadTime` or `stop` immediately after a `setFile` when the browser is using HTML5 native audio, now works and does not throw an exception.
* Fixed major bug: Local server testing on Firefox 3.6 developed a problem when inserting the Flash SWF file into the webpage. This caused the SWF to be loaded twice for an unknown reason. A 100ms delay was added to the initialization of the `ExternalInterface.addCallback()` declarations and the `jPlayerReady` signal. This solved the problem with local testing on Firefox 3.6.
* Fixed minor bug: Event functions default to an empty function. Developer defined functions are checked that they are a function, otherwise an alert box will notify of the problem (when `{warningAlerts:true}`). Affects the constructor `ready()` function, `onSoundComplete()` and `onProgressChange()`.
* Fixed minor bug: Corrected the HTML5 `jPlayer.play` event code in IE, `setInterval(function, time, argument)`, since IE only supports `setInterval(function, time)`. (IE does not supports HTML5 at the moment.)
* Fixed minor bug: When in an HTML5 browser, the `setFile` command caused the audio file to be pinged before a `play` command was given. This has been fixed so that the audio file will not be touched until a `play` command is given.
* Fixed minor bug: When in an HTML5 browser that supports `HTMLMediaElement.buffered.end()`, such as Safari 4, stopping or pausing jPlayer while the download was in progress would freeze the load bar. This fix allows the load bar to function correctly, irrespective of whether jPlayer is playing or not.
* Method renaming: `jPlayerId` method renamed to `cssId` to match data structure.
* Removed Feature: Removed the `bufferMsg` method and associated code, since this feature was only supported when the Flash component was used.
* Removed feature: Hover states are no longer managed through the jqjp\_hover class. Originally added to correct IE6 :hover not working correctly. All hover states should now be defined using standard :hover CSS.
* Removed feature: Buffer state is no longer managed through the jqjp\_buffer class on the load bar. The original feature would only work when Flash was being used. The feature was removed so that the HTML5 and Flash solutions are identical.
* New feature: jPlayer now has default CSS Ids built into it. Added `customCssId` constructor option to control whether the default CSS Ids are used. See documentation for more information. (Default: `{customCssId:false}`
* New feature: Added `nativeSupport` constuctor option to force jPlayer to use the Flash component. (Default: `{nativeSupport:true}`)
* New feature: Added `errorAlerts` and `warningAlerts` constructor options to help debug jPlayer projects. (Default: `{errorAlerts:false, warningAlerts:false}`
* New feature: Added `graphicsFix` constructor option to allow the hidden random number text to be disabled. The random number is used to fix graphical update problems with Safari and Chrome browsers.
* New feature: All jPlayer configuration information is available via `jPlayer("getData", dataName)` method. This includes new diagnostic information such as whether jPlayer is playing a track or not. For advanced users, read/write access is provided through `$("jpId").data("jPlayer.config")`. See documentation for full details.
* New feature: Changed `swfPath` logic to accommodate a trailing slash on the path. Eg. `{swfPath: "myDir"}` is the same as `{swfPath: "myDir/"}`.
* New feature: Calls to the Flash are now in a try/catch statement. If the function fails, an alert notifies the developer (when `{errorAlerts:true}`) that there is a problem with the swfPath and/or Jplayer.swf file location.
* New feature: The final call of `onProgressChange` happens after all internal configuration data has been updated. When `onSoundComplete` occurs, `onProgressChange` is called once afterwards. The HTML5 and Flash solutions mirror this sequence.
* Code quality: Refactored code to remove all `eval()` statements.
* Code quality: Unbound internal events when a new `cssId` is given. (Note: `cssId` was formerly `jPlayerId`.)
* Code quality: jQuery selectors are stored internally, so that they are only called once. (Improves performance.)

### jPlayer 0.2.5 beta Release notes

* Released: 25th August 2009
* Fixed major bug: The HTML `canPlayType(MIME)` now checks for an empty string and a "no". This corrects a bug that affected new browsers as they adopted changes to the HTML5 Draft Spec. This bug had affected updates to Firefox 3.5 and Safari 4.
* Fixed bug with the `volume` constructor option when using HTML5. The new audio file is now initialised with the current volume. The current volume is now stored/maintained in the jPlayer config.
* Removed all text from the hidden flash class. This was confusing screen readers as they were 'displaying' / 'reading out loud' the hidden flash text. This text was purely for development and testing and has been commented out in the AS2 code.
* Fixed bug with the audio tag id, `config.aid`, being used before being defined.
* Fixed minor bug with the HTML5 initiation call in IE, `setTimeout(function, time, argument)`, since IE only supports `setTimeout(function, time)`. (IE does not supports HTML5 at the moment.)

### jPlayer 0.2.4 beta Release notes

* Released: 1st July 2009
* Added support for OGG files, where the browser is found to support HTML5 with OGG format. (Currently only Firefox 3.5) The constructor option {oggSupport: true} enables this feature, where an ogg file must then be given as a second attribute to all `jPlayer.setFile(mp3, ogg)` commands. Priority given as 1) HTML5/OGG, 2) HTML5/MP3, 3) Flash/MP3
* Fixed bug in Safari 4 with `jPlayer.setFile(mp3, [ogg])`, where the mp3 file could not be changed from the 1st specified. This bug had affected browsers that supported HTML5 with mp3 format. (Currently only Safari 4)
* Made the loadbar work with browsers that support HTML5 and have the `HTMLMediaElement.buffered` DOM object implemented. (Currently only Safari 4)
* Added `jPlayer.jPlayerGetInfo(element)` method to enable access to basic diagnostic information.

### jPlayer 0.2.3 beta Release notes

* Released: 22nd June 2009
* Added [HTML5](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/) support for the `[<audio>](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#audio)` element on compliant browsers that can play mp3 format. At release, only the [WebKit](http://webkit.org/) [nightly builds](http://nightly.webkit.org/) for Mac OS X has implemented HTML5 support for mp3 format.
* Revised coding of constructor option function `ready()` along with the methods `jPlayer.onSoundComplete(fn)` and `jPlayer.onProgressChange(fn)` to enable the use of `$(this)` within the user defined functions.
* Fixed bug with multiple instances, where using: `jPlayer.setFile(f)` **twice**, `jPlayer.stop()`, `jPlayer.playHead(p)` or `jPlayer.playHeadTime(t)` on an instance that had never been played using `jPlayer.play()` would cause all sounds to stop, regardless of the jPlayer instance.
* Added the constructor option `volume` to enable setting of the initial volume value.
* Reviewed the naming of jPlayer's internal methods to improve compatibility with other plugins.

### jPlayer 0.2.2 beta Release notes

* Released: 20th May 2009
* Renamed `jPlayer.change(file)` to `jPlayer.setFile(file)` to avoid jQuery naming conflict with the `[jQuery.change(fn)](http://docs.jquery.com/Events/change)` event.
* Appropriate jPlayer methods now return a pointer to `$(this)`, which enables chaining.
* Removed the `jPlayer.changeAndPlay(file)` method, as chaining makes this redundent.
* Added a check for Flash 8 and if not installed, gives a warning and a link to the [Flash plugin](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer). Adapted the function checkForFlash from [FlashReplace](https://code.google.com/p/flashreplace/) by [Robert Nyman](http://www.robertnyman.com).
* Changed the `getMovie()` in the plugin to always return the `document[fid]`. Previously, Internet Explorer would return `window[fid]` instead. This removes a browser conditional statement, which was found to be redundent since the plugin adds the Flash object to the document definition in IE.
* Debugged `jPlayer.playHead(p)` so that it could be used immediately after `jPlayer.setFile(file)` without needing a `jPlayer.play()` command prior to it.
* Added a new method called `jPlayer.playHeadTime(t)` to make the play head jump to the time defined in seconds.

### jPlayer 0.2.1 beta Release notes

* Released: 4th May 2009
* Initial beta release version of the jPlayer plugin
* Released under the [MIT licence](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)

CVE-2013-1942 was assigned for jPlayer 2.2.19 XSS, which is included
in ownCloud (and possibly other things?).

> CVE-2013-2022 and CVE-2013-2023 on other side for jplayer itself?

CVE-2013-2022 is for jPlayer 2.2.20 XSS

CVE-2013-2023 is for jPlayer 2.2.23 XSS

So XSS's in 3 different versions of jPlayer.
