{
  "CVE-2013-2110": {
    "Description": "The quoted_printable_encode function in PHP does not properly calculate the required buffer size, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause of the vulnerability is an incorrect string size calculation within the `quoted_printable_encode` function in PHP. This leads to the allocation of insufficient memory, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow during the encoding process.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition due to a crash. It may also be possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code if they are able to carefully craft the input to the `quoted_printable_encode` function.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input string to the `quoted_printable_encode` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to pass a malicious string to the `quoted_printable_encode` function. This likely involves the attacker having some capability to influence PHP code logic or data, and/or the ability to make requests with crafted data."
