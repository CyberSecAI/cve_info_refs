Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2842:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the Chromium web browser. Specifically, it occurs during the handling of widgets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: This type of vulnerability arises when a program attempts to use memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploitation can lead to a crash or hang of the browser.
- Potential for other unspecified impacts: There's also the possibility that an attacker could exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, although this is not explicitly stated.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attackers: The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, meaning an attacker does not need local access to the user's machine.
- Vectors related to the handling of widgets: The specific means of triggering the vulnerability are related to the processing of widgets within the browser, although the technical details of how this happens are not detailed in the provided text.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to serve/deliver content to the victim's browser: The attacker would need to be able to get a user to load a web page or resource that triggers the vulnerability (e.g., via a malicious website or a compromised website).
- Knowledge of the specific vulnerable code: The attacker would need to know how to craft the malicious web content in a way that would trigger the use-after-free.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Chromium browsers before version 27.0.1453.93.
- This CVE is also referenced in the security content of Apple's iTunes 11.1.4 and iOS 7, indicating that WebKit, which is used in these products, was also vulnerable. The fix in iTunes and iOS is attributed to Cyril Cattiaux, who also discovered this bug in Chromium
- This vulnerability was assigned a "High" severity rating by Google in Chrome 27 release notes and a $2000 reward was issued.
