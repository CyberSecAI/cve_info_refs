[Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-print/)

## Description

Once installed take the following steps to set it up:

1. WP-Print settings page is located in WP-Admin -> Settings -> Print
2. You Need To Re-Generate The Permalink (WP-Admin -> Settings -> Permalinks -> Save Changes)
3. Refer To Usage For Further Instructions

### Usage

1. Open `wp-content/themes/<YOUR THEME NAME>/index.php`. You should place it in single.php, post.php, page.php, etc also if they exist.
2. Find: `<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>`
3. Add Anywhere Below It: `<?php if(function_exists('wp_print')) { print_link(); } ?>`

* The first value is the text for printing post.
* The second value is the text for printing page.
* Default: print\_link(”, ”)
* Alternatively, you can set the text in ‘WP-Admin -> Settings -> Print’.
* If you DO NOT want the print link to appear in every post/page, DO NOT use the code above. Just type in **[print\_link]** into the selected post/page content and it will embed the print link into that post/page only.

  Print Page

## FAQ

### How do I add this to my theme?

1. Open `wp-content/themes/<YOUR THEME NAME>/index.php`

   You may place it in single.php, post.php, page.php, etc also.
2. Find: `<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>`
3. Add Anywhere Below It: `<?php if(function_exists('wp_print')) { print_link(); } ?>`

Simply add this code inside the loop ### where you want the print link to display:

```
if(function_exists('wp_print')) {
    print_link();
}

```

### If you do not want to print a portion of your post’s content

[donotprint]Text within this tag will not be displayed when printing[/donotprint]

* The text within [donotprint][/donotprint] will not be displayed when you are viewing a printer friendly version of a post or page.
* However, it will still be displayed as normal on a normal post or page view.
* Do note that if you are using WP-Email, any text within [donotprint][/donotprint] will not be emailed as well.

### Custom Template

* WP-Print will load ‘print-css.css’, ‘print-posts.php’ and ‘print-comments.php’ from your theme’s directory if it exists.
* If it doesn’t exists, it will just load the respective default file that comes with WP-Print.
* This will allow you to upgrade WP-Print without worrying about overwriting your printing styles or templates that you have created.

WP-Print is a nice plugin, very easy to use. I encounter a problem when printing your special ‘print webpage’. Your webpage is always printed in black and white even the page has colored contents. Any idea? Many thanks!

I installed the plugin, then went to the configuration and was able to configure the plug-in. Tried not installing the PHP on every page as per instructions, and only adding the shortcode. That process seemed to work fine, the button appears and shows the text print. But when I click it, it tries to visit <domain>/<path/to/post>/post/print
Since /print is not a valid page, I assume this is something the plugin should fix, but instead it shows 404.
