Package        : sudo
Vulnerability  : several issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1775 CVE-2013-1776
Debian Bug     : 701838 701839

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in sudo, a program designed
to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges to users. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-1775

    Marco Schoepl discovered an authentication bypass when the clock is
    set to the UNIX epoch [00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970].

CVE-2013-1776

    Ryan Castellucci and James Ogden discovered aspects of an issue that
    would allow session id hijacking from another authorized tty.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.4p4-2.squeeze.4.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, these problems
have been fixed in version 1.8.5p2-1+nmu1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=949753#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-04-08 22:42:42 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2013-2777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2777) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2013-2777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2777) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2777> Assigned: 20130408 Reference: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/27/31> Reference: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=916365](show_bug.cgi?id=916365 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1776 sudo: bypass of tty_tickets constraints") Reference: <http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/2f3225a2a4a4> Reference: <http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/bfa23f089bba> Reference: <http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/tty_tickets.html> Reference: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/58207>  sudo before 1.7.10p5 and 1.8.x before 1.8.6p6, when the tty_tickets option is enabled, does not properly validate the controlling terminal device, which allows local users with sudo permissions to hijack the authorization of another terminal via vectors related to a session without a controlling terminal device and connecting to a standard input, output, and error file descriptors of another terminal.  NOTE: this is one of three closely-related vulnerabilities that were originally assigned [CVE-2013-1776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1776), but they have been SPLIT because of different affected versions.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=949753#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-09-26 09:53:39 UTC  ``` Looking at the upstream commits, it seems that this flaw exists because of incomplete/insufficient fix applied for the [CVE-2013-1776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1776) flaw.  Since the patch for [CVE-2013-1776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1776) was not backported to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, this flaw does not affect it   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=949753#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2013-10-09 21:11:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=949753#c2)) > Looking at the upstream commits, it seems that this flaw exists because of > incomplete/insufficient fix applied for the [CVE-2013-1776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1776) flaw.  Hence this CVE affects versions starting with 1.7.10 and 1.8.5 and is corrected in versions 1.7.10p5 and 1.8.6p6.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=949753#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-21 23:12:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1701 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1701.html>   ``` |  |

# Potential bypass of tty\_tickets constraints

Feb 27, 2013

When a user successfully authenticates with sudo, a time stamp file
is updated to allow that user to continue running sudo without
requiring a password for a preset time period (five minutes by
default).

This time stamp file can either be common to all of a user’s
terminals, or it can be specific to the particular terminal the
user authenticated themselves on. The terminal-specific time stamp
file behavior can be controlled using the *tty\_tickets* option in
the sudoers file. This option has been enabled by default since
sudo 1.7.4. Prior to sudo 1.7.4, the default was to use a single
time stamp for all the user’s sessions.

A vulnerability exists because the user can control which terminal
the standard input, output and error file descriptors (0-2) refer
to. A malicious user could use this to run commands via sudo without
authenticating, so long as there exists a terminal the user has
access to where a sudo command was successfully run by that same
user within the password timeout period (usually five minutes).

The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other than
those allowed by the sudoers policy.

## Sudo versions affected:

Sudo 1.3.5 through 1.7.10p5 and sudo 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p6 inclusive
when the “tty\_tickets” option is enabled. This option is enabled
by default in sudo 1.7.4 and above.

## CVE ID:

This vulnerability has been assigned
[CVE-2013-1776](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1776)
in the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) database.

## Details:

The vulnerability can be triggered when the standard input, output
and error file descriptors (0-2) of a process are closed and a
different terminal device is opened and connected to those descriptors.
When sudo tries to determine the terminal device via the `ttyname()`
function, it will get the name of the other terminal instead. The
core problem is that while `ttyname()` can be used to determine the
name of the terminal device connected to a specific file descriptor,
there is no portable way to determine the name of the terminal
associated with the session the process belongs to. However, on
many systems it is possible to determine this by using the `/proc` file
system or the `sysctl()` function.

Most operating systems that have the `/proc` file system provide a
way to determine the controlling terminal device number for a process;
this information is used by the ps command for example. On Linux, this
is the `tty_nr` field in `/proc/self/stat` (the seventh entry). On
systems with an SVR4-style `/proc`, this is the `pr_ttydev` member of
`struct psinfo`, which comes from `/proc/self/psinfo`. Most BSD systems
that support the `sysctl()` function also provide a way to get the
terminal device number via the `KERN_PROC_PID` sysctl. By mapping
this device number to a file name, it is possible to get the name
of the terminal file without resorting to `ttyname()`. Sudo began
using this method to determine the process’s terminal starting
with version 1.8.5 and 1.7.10.

However, sudo still used the `ttyname()` function as a fall back when
no controlling terminal was found via `/proc` or `sysctl()`. This
allowed a malicious process to cause sudo to use `ttyname()` simply
by creating a new session without a controlling tty before executing
sudo. In sudo 1.8.6p6 and 1.7.10p5, this fall back behavior was
removed. This fixed the vulnerability for systems where the process’s
controlling terminal could be determined via `/proc` or `sysctl()`.

Sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p6 contain an additional fix for systems
without `/proc` or `sysctl()` that stores the POSIX session ID in the
time stamp file itself. The controlling terminal is specific to
the POSIX session it is associated with. It is not possible for
two processes in different sessions to have the same controlling
terminal. Sudo will now compare the current session ID with the
one in the time stamp file and ignore the time stamp file if the
session ID does not match. This has the additional benefit of
making it much less likely that a user will be able to reuse the
time stamp file after logging out and back in again on the same
terminal.

## Impact:

A (potentially malicious) program run by a user with sudo access
may be able to bypass the *tty\_tickets* constraints. In order for
this to succeed there must exist on the machine a terminal device
that the user has previously authenticated themselves on via sudo
within the last time stamp timeout (5 minutes by default).

This program may use sudo’s `-n` flag to “probe” the terminals in
question to see if there is an active time stamp file for the user.
Prior to sudo 1.8.6 and 1.7.10, if a password was required when the
-n flag was specified the failure would not be logged, allowing
the program to perform such probes without being detected. The
successful command (if any), would still be logged.

## Fix:

The bug is fixed in sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p6.

## Credit:

Ryan Castellucci brought the initial `ttyname()` issue to my attention.
Subsequently, James Ogden discovered that using `setsid()` to create
a new session would cause sudo to fall back to using `ttyname()`.

Other shortcomings in sudo’s *tty\_tickets* functionality have been
known and discussed openly for some time. There is a long discussion
about them at [Ubuntu](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/sudo/%2Bbug/87023).

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Find changesets by keywords (author, files, the commit message), revision
number or hash, or [revset expression](/repos/sudo/help/revsets).

Store the session ID in the tty ticket file too. A tty may only
be in one session at a time so if the session ID doesn't match we
ignore the ticket.

## Synopsis

Low: sudo security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1701)

## Topic

An updated sudo package that fixes two security issues, several bugs, and
adds two enhancements is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
certain users the ability to run commands as root.

A flaw was found in the way sudo handled time stamp files. An attacker able
to run code as a local user and with the ability to control the system
clock could possibly gain additional privileges by running commands that
the victim user was allowed to run via sudo, without knowing the victim's
password. (CVE-2013-1775)

It was found that sudo did not properly validate the controlling terminal
device when the tty\_tickets option was enabled in the /etc/sudoers file.
An attacker able to run code as a local user could possibly gain additional
privileges by running commands that the victim user was allowed to run via
sudo, without knowing the victim's password. (CVE-2013-2776, CVE-2013-2777)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, sudo did not support netgroup filtering for sources from the

System Security Services Daemon (SSSD). Consequently, SSSD rules were
applied to all users even when they did not belong to the specified
netgroup. With this update, netgroup filtering for SSSD sources has been
implemented. As a result, rules with a netgroup specification are applied
only to users that are part of the netgroup. (BZ#880150)

* When the sudo utility set up the environment in which it ran a command,

it reset the value of the RLIMIT\_NPROC resource limit to the parent's value
of this limit if both the soft (current) and hard (maximum) values of
RLIMIT\_NPROC were not limited. An upstream patch has been provided to
address this bug and RLIMIT\_NPROC can now be set to "unlimited".
(BZ#947276)

* Due to the refactoring of the sudo code by upstream, the SUDO\_USER

variable that stores the name of the user running the sudo command was not
logged to the /var/log/secure file as before. Consequently, user name
"root" was always recorded instead of the real user name. With this update,
the previous behavior of sudo has been restored. As a result, the expected
user name is now written to /var/log/secure. (BZ#973228)

* Due to an error in a loop condition in sudo's rule listing code, a buffer

overflow could have occurred in certain cases. This condition has been
fixed and the buffer overflow no longer occurs. (BZ#994626)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

* With this update, sudo has been modified to send debug messages about

netgroup matching to the debug log. These messages should provide better
understanding of how sudo matches netgroup database records with values
from the running system and what the values are exactly. (BZ#848111)

* With this update, sudo has been modified to accept the ipa\_hostname value

from the /etc/sssd/sssd.conf configuration file when matching netgroups.
(BZ#853542)

All sudo users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues and add
these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Find changesets by keywords (author, files, the commit message), revision
number or hash, or [revset expression](/repos/sudo/help/revsets).

Store the session ID in the tty ticket file too. A tty may only
be in one session at a time so if the session ID doesn't match we
ignore the ticket.

Here are the details from the Slackware 14.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/sudo-1.8.6p7-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.   This update fixes security issues that could allow a user to run commands   without authenticating after the password timeout has already expired.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=949751#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-04-08 22:35:39 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2013-2776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2776) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2013-2776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2776) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2776> Assigned: 20130408 Reference: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/27/31> Reference: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=916365](show_bug.cgi?id=916365 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1776 sudo: bypass of tty_tickets constraints") Reference: <http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/049a12a5cc14> Reference: <http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/0c0283d1fafa> Reference: <http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/tty_tickets.html> Reference: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/58207>  sudo 1.3.5 through 1.7.10p5 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p6, when running on systems without /proc or the sysctl function with the tty_tickets option enabled, does not properly validate the controlling terminal device, which allows local users with sudo permissions to hijack the authorization of another terminal via vectors related to connecting to a standard input, output, and error file descriptors of another terminal.  NOTE: this is one of three closely-related vulnerabilities that were originally assigned [CVE-2013-1776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1776), but they have been SPLIT because of different affected versions.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=949751#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-01 00:29:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:1353 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1353.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=949751#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2013-10-09 20:52:48 UTC  ``` This CVE split out of [CVE-2013-1776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1776) is for a sudo enhancement that makes sudo store session id in a ticket file to disallow use of the ticket by a process from a different session.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=949751#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-21 23:12:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1701 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1701.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=949751#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-11-22 05:36:34 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ``` |  |

## Topic

An updated sudo package that fixes multiple security issues and several
bugs is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
certain users the ability to run commands as root.

A flaw was found in the way sudo handled time stamp files. An attacker able
to run code as a local user and with the ability to control the system
clock could possibly gain additional privileges by running commands that
the victim user was allowed to run via sudo, without knowing the victim's
password. (CVE-2013-1775)

It was found that sudo did not properly validate the controlling terminal
device when the tty\_tickets option was enabled in the /etc/sudoers file. An
attacker able to run code as a local user could possibly gain additional
privileges by running commands that the victim user was allowed to run via
sudo, without knowing the victim's password. (CVE-2013-1776, CVE-2013-2776)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Due to a bug in the cycle detection algorithm of the visudo utility,

visudo incorrectly evaluated certain alias definitions in the /etc/sudoers
file as cycles. Consequently, a warning message about undefined aliases
appeared. This bug has been fixed, /etc/sudoers is now parsed correctly by
visudo and the warning message no longer appears. (BZ#849679)

* Previously, the 'sudo -l' command did not parse the /etc/sudoers file

correctly if it contained an Active Directory (AD) group. The file was
parsed only up to the first AD group information and then the parsing
failed with the following message:

sudo: unable to cache group ADDOM\admingroup, already exists

With this update, the underlying code has been modified and 'sudo -l' now
parses /etc/sudoers containing AD groups correctly. (BZ#855836)

* Previously, the sudo utility did not escape the backslash characters

contained in user names properly. Consequently, if a system used sudo
integrated with LDAP or Active Directory (AD) as the primary authentication
mechanism, users were not able to authenticate on that system. With this
update, sudo has been modified to process LDAP and AD names correctly and
the authentication process now works as expected. (BZ#869287)

* Prior to this update, the 'visudo -s (strict)' command incorrectly parsed

certain alias definitions. Consequently, an error message was issued. The
bug has been fixed, and parsing errors no longer occur when using 'visudo

* s'. (BZ#905624)

All sudo users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=916365#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-27 22:44:01 UTC  ``` From the upstream advisory:  When a user successfully authenticates with sudo, a time stamp file is updated to allow that user to continue running sudo without requiring a password for a preset time period (five minutes by default). This time stamp file can either be common to all of a user's terminals, or it can be specific to the particular terminal the user authenticated themselves on. The terminal-specific time stamp file behavior can be controlled using the "tty_tickets" option in the sudoers file. This option has been enabled by default since sudo 1.7.4. Prior to sudo 1.7.4, the default was to use a single time stamp for all the user's sessions.  A vulnerability exists because the user can control which terminal the standard input, output and error file descriptors (0-2) refer to. A malicious user could use this to run commands via sudo without authenticating, so long as there exists a terminal the user has access to where a sudo command was successfully run by that same user within the password timeout period (usually five minutes).  The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other than those allowed by the sudoers policy.  This affects versions 1.3.5 through up to the fixed 1.7.10p6 version, and sudo 1.8.0 through to the fixed 1.8.7p7.  The fix for 1.7.x: <http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/0c0283d1fafa>  The fix for 1.8.x: <http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/049a12a5cc14>   External References:  <http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/tty_tickets.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=916365#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-27 22:47:57 UTC  ``` Created sudo tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 916367](show_bug.cgi?id=916367 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1775 CVE-2013-1776 sudo various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=916365#c3)  Fedora Update System    2013-03-16 01:22:29 UTC  ``` sudo-1.8.6p7-1.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

NOTE: this is one of three closely-related vulnerabilities that were originally assigned [CVE-2013-1776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1776), but they have been SPLIT because of different affected versions.  See [bug #949751](show_bug.cgi?id=949751 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2776 sudo: bypass of tty_tickets constraints") for [CVE-2013-2776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2776) and [bug #949753](show_bug.cgi?id=949753 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2777 sudo: bypass of tty_tickets constraints") for [CVE-2013-2777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2777)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=916365#c14)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-09-30 03:46:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHBA-2013:0363 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-0363.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=916365#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-01 00:29:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:1353 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1353.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=916365#c16)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-10-01 04:56:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been classified as low security impact, because of the following reasons.  1. A user already needs to have sudo access on the target machine.  2. Successful exploitation of this issue, only results in bypass of sudo cache credential timeout, it does not provide any additional privileges to the attacker.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=916365#c17)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-10-01 04:59:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=916365#c18)  Tomas Hoger    2013-10-09 21:06:07 UTC  ``` This CVE was assigned to the issue that allowed bypassing tty_tickets restriction by opening another terminal device and connecting it to stdin/stdout/stderr.  To address the bypass, sudo was modified to extract tty information from /proc.  The fix was implemented in sudo versions 1.8.5 and 1.7.10.  However, the fix could still allow fall back to use stdin/stdout/stderr check in certain cases.  Another way to bypass that check was discovered later and what [CVE-2013-2777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2777) ([bug 949753](show_bug.cgi?id=949753 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2777 sudo: bypass of tty_tickets constraints")) was assigned to.  This issue was already fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 packages when they were rebased form 1.7.4p5 to 1.8.6p3 in RHBA-2013:0363 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4.   ``` |  |

# sudo option "tty\_tickets" gives false sense of security due to reused pts numbers

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: sudo

When we have the option "tty\_tickets" in '/etc/sudoers', for each new terminal (tty) or pseudo-terminal-slave (pts) where we use 'sudo', we get a sudo ticket in '/var/run/sudo/yourusername/'. These are named "tty1", "tty2" etc. for tty's, and "1", "2", "3", etc. for pts's.

Also, when we invoke a graphical instance of 'sudo' through e.g. 'kdesu', new pts's are reserved for this purpose. Applications started through 'kdesu' require \_two\_ pts's, and sudo tickets are assigned corresponding to the numbers of these pts's.

This report affects, as I understand it, both 'sudo' and 'kdesu'. I do not know what is the behaviour of 'gksudo' in relation to this bug, so I don't know if this report should also affect it.

Now, I will give three different scenarios in which 'sudo' or a graphical application requiring sudo capabilities can be run without a password, but when the user would \_not\_ expect to be able to do so.

N.B.: Before each scenario, we must be sure we have no active sudo tickets in the above mentioned directory. Doing 'sudo su', 'rm /var/run/sudo/yourusername/\*' and 'exit' in a terminal should be enough to ensure this. (I will start the examples from a clean desktop with e.g. no Konsole windows running. This is not completely necessary, as the \_absolute\_ numbers of pts's involved are not important to reproduce the behaviour.)

Useful commands for demonstrating what happens are:

'sudo ls --full-time /var/run/sudo/yourusername/'

'ps au' (to show which pts's are in use, and by what processes)

'tty' (run e.g. in Konsole to show which pts we are on)

Scenario 1:

- Open a Konsole (or Yakuake).

- Do 'sudo ls --full-time /var/run/sudo/yourusername', and give your password.

- Do 'tty'

- Do 'exit'. If you are in Konsole, this should close it completely -> now, start a new Konsole. If you are in Yakuake, it should do this automatically for you (spawn a new shell).

- \_Now\_, we have closed the console we used. It \_seems\_ reasonable to expect that after we closed the console where 'sudo' was used, the sudo capability would expire.

- Do 'sudo foo' or 'sudo ls --full-time /var/run/sudo/yourusername', and you can do this without giving your password.

- If we again do 'tty', we will see that we are re-using the previous pts number, which is the cause of this phenomenon.

Scenario 2:

- Open a Konsole (or Yakuake).

- Add a new terminal tab, and in this tab do 'sudo foo', giving your password. Do not close this tab.

- Add a third terminal tab, and in this tab do 'sudo foo', giving your password. Now we have three tabs open in Konsole or Yakuake.

- Close tabs two and three. (This will free two pts's.)

(- In the first tab, just to illustrate, run 'sudo ls --full-time /var/run/sudo/yourusername', again giving your password.)

- Run e.g. Adept or Synaptic, expecting to give your password. You should be able to do this without giving your password.

- If we again do 'sudo ls --full-time /var/run/sudo/yourusername' in the first terminal tab, we will notice that two of the timestamps have the same time. What happens is that 'kdesu' will utilise the first two free pts's, which we just freed, and which, incidentally, happened to have valid sudo timestamps.

Scenario 3:

(Optional: - Open a Konsole or Yakuake.)

- Run e.g. Adept or Synaptic, this time giving your password. Close it.

- Open two new Yakuake tabs or Konsole windows or tabs.

(- In the already opened terminal, do 'sudo ls --full-time /var/run/sudo/yourusername', which will give you the number of the valid sudo ticket.)

- In the second newly opened terminal, you should be able to run 'sudo foo' without giving your password. (IIRC, I have done this in the first new terminal instance sometime, possibly. It all depends on which pts number we are given. N.B. Normally 'kdesu' leaves behind only one valid sudo ticket, as in this scenario.)

(- You can do 'tty' to verify that this is the same terminal that we saw had the valid sudo ticket.)

I discovered this misbehaviour in sudo and applications that require sudo capabilities while investigating [bug #72545](/bugs/72545) (and [bug #50971](/bugs/50971)).

There are two separate issues here, as I understand it.

Issue 1. As implied by the title of this bug, this gives the user a false sense of security under some conditions.

Case 1.1: The user can (IMO rightly) expect that closing the terminal should \_remove sudo capabilities\_. It isn't intuitive to expect that a \_new\_ terminal instance should inherit previously affirmed sudo capabilities. When pts numbers get re-used and sudo tickets are not cleared, this is the resulting problem.

Case 1.2: The user can expect that launching a graphical application that requires sudo capability should \_always\_ ask for the password. (I won't go into separate password caching capabilities of these, I fear it may be an entirely separate can of worms.) As previously, it isn't intuitive to expect that this should inherit previously affirmed sudo capabilities. This case isn't \_necessarily\_ all that damaging, e.g. in the case of running Adept or Synaptic, \_but\_ wrong nonetheless; however, we can imagine a situation where a graphically launched application requiring sudo capabilities could harm the user's system, and would \_normally\_ alert the user's attention by requiring the user's password.

Case 1.3: Running a graphical application that requires sudo capability should \_not\_, in my opinion, leave behind a used sudo ticket that can be re-used in a terminal.

Issue 2. This is at least a theoretical vulnerability in the system, if this \_same\_ user's account can be exploited. As I understand it, pts numbers are assigned to remote connections as well, so by coincidence a remote connection could receive a used but recently freed pts that has a valid sudo tty\_ticket.

Case 2.0: If this user's account (in the "admin" group) and \_password\_ have been compromised, this is a \_non-issue\_. If the password is out, trying to exploit \_this\_ behaviour isn't necessary.

Case 2.1: If this user's account can be accessed otherwise, but the password isn't known, this would appear to be an issue. I don't think I can think of many scenarios where this could happen, but I imagine it is still at least a possibility. (Using 'tty\_tickets' is in this case of course more secure than the system would be without it.)

As this issue seems somewhat hard to remedy completely, I decided to comment on possible remedies separately.

It would seem beneficial that unused tty\_tickets from '/var/run/sudo/yourusername' should be cleared. More specifically, the tickets for such tty's and pts's that \_are not in use\_ at any point in time should be cleared.

Now, what process could be responsible for doing this?

A. The kernel and "devpts", which is responsible for assigning new pts's at '/dev/pts/\*'. It could be argued that this would be the right place, to tackle the authorisation issue at a low level. It could also be argued the opposite, that authorisation issues do not belong here, that it is not the kernel's job to do things for sudo. This would mean that this should be handled in userspace.

B. A root level "sudo daemon" that would keep an eye on tty's and pts's on one hand and sudo's tty\_tickets on the other hand. Whenever a terminal or a pseudo-terminal is freed, the daemon would clear the appropriate sudo tty\_ticket for all users, and possibly make a note in a log. (The tty's probably would need to be handled differently than the pts's.)

C. For graphical applications requiring sudo access, the application that granted the access could also clear the ticket when the sudo capability isn't needed anymore. (E.g. 'kdesu' or 'kdesud'. It seems the 'kdesud' is used for caching the password given to 'kdesu'.)

D. A work-around is to use "timestamp\_timeout=0" in '/etc/sudoers', but this takes away a usability feature from sudo.

A couple non-working "solutions" follow:

E. "The command 'sudo' should be responsible for clearing the ticket." This can't be done, because sudo is not running when the terminal is freed.

F. "The terminal or 'bash' should be responsible." This can't be done because the terminal or the shell are not root-level processes, and so can't remove root-owned tty\_tickets.

One more possible solution / workaround:

G. For (primarily) \_non\_-graphical use-cases of sudo, and to clean-up after graphical applications that lack this functionality -> A new usage option for 'sudo' that is like 'sudo -K' but, instead of only operating on the ticket of the current terminal, cleans \_all\_ the tickets in '/var/run/sudo/yourusername/'.

The possible downside is that this requires that the user manually (or semi-manually) evokes it. The upside is the same as that stated in 'man sudo' for 'sudo -k' (and, implied, for 'sudo -K'): "This option does not require a password and was added to allow a user to revoke sudo permissions from a .logout file."

As demonstrated by this report and some others, it is quite easy and all the more common to have a number of terminals open, and to use 'sudo' in those or through graphical means. In view of this, I think the option presented here would often prove useful. I wouldn't actually mind if 'sudo -K' would operate on all of the current user's tickets by default.

Thanks for this well-described bug report! I wonder if some people would describe the "authenticated old tty" issue as a "feature"? I would tend to agree, though, that it is surprising to open a terminal and not get prompted. I find your "Issue 2" the most compelling -- this should not be allowed to happen.

As you've hinted, the "original" solution, in the design of sudo in general, was for users to add "sudo -K" to their ~/.bash\_logout file. However, I suspect that isn't a proper solution (especially for gksu/kdesu). I haven't checked, but if udev receives notifications about pts devices being removed, perhaps it could be responsible for running "sudo -K" (or something similar)? That might solve all three scenarios, though I'm curious about the double pts allocation with kdesu.

The double pts requirement with 'kdesu' could (even) be by design to "circumvent" the issue of old tickets lying around (compare with the bugs referenced above), but this would be bad design. It seems more likely, though, that it is just a side effect of starting a process and then forking it into different parts that have different tasks.

Also, what is problematic with the cases under "Issue 1", is that these cross the border between graphical and command line sudo access, which is very unintuitive for the user. It's OK if 'kdesu' remembers that I've just given my password, \_if\_ I've accepted this in its options. However, having a sudo capable shell isn't really OK, if I've only given my password to 'kdesu'. And vice versa.

(As a parenthesis: A real-life case I can think of is wanting to try out and './install' some 3rd party software, which has its own installation method (be it text-based or graphical). This could even have the option to \_either\_ install globally (if given the permissions) or as a fall-back to install locally for the user only. A password prompt at this point is very indicative to the user about where exactly things will be installed, and missing the password prompt can lead, at best, to confusion.)

After talking to gregkh and hpa, it seems there are no udev events for pts add/remove. :( To do this, the pts kernel could would need to be written to use kobjects.

I'm wondering - should this report be marked as concerning also 'kdesu', i.e. "kdebase", due to it leaving behind a valid sudo ticket?

Also, I am curious to know - does 'gksudo' leave behind a valid sudo ticket, or is the ticket cleared afterwards? (And, consequently, if a ticket is left behind, should this report be marked as also concerning the package providing 'gksudo'?)

kko: No, this only affects sudo and perhaps udev -- things like kdesu that build on top of sudo do not have any particular privileges and cannot fiddle with tickets.

Thank you for the information. Taking a look at kdesu's permissions I see what you mean.

I see a few options for dealing with console log-outs:

1) Add "sudo -K" to /etc/skel/.bash\_logout via patch to bash pkg. (This doesn't catch upgrades, and doesn't handle people not using bash.)

2) Dig into pam's session management and write new module to be added as login and ssh required "session" modules. (Seems a bit sloppy.)

3) Using a recent patch to mainline, write a logout-watching daemon that cleans up after sudo when a pts goes away (this seems really like too heavy a solution)

4) Patch the pts code to use kobjects and hook up a listener to "remove" events. (This is a lot of work.)

As for the GUI apps, I think sudo (and the GUI su-ing apps) should be patched to add something like "--single-shot", where no tty-based ticket is left behind.

Incidentally, I was pondering this too, after my last comment, so I'll comment on these suggestions.

For GUI apps, I agree with you. It should be easy for 'kdesu' or 'gksudo' to:

- Obtain needed privileges and launch the app requiring sudo privileges.

- Immediately afterwards call 'sudo -K' on the appropriate pts.

This should take care of the GUI side of the problem - see further though.

I don't really understand how 'kdesud' is supposed to work. I suppose it just sits there for as long as kdesu is configured to remember the password given to it, and is supposed to catch further launches of 'kdesu'. (It doesn't for me, so I wonder \_why\_ it is launched at all, but it's a different issue.) I don't know if 'kdesud' needs the ticket at all - according to 'man kdesu' it wouldn't: "The passwords are NOT written to disk, but stored in memory using a special program, kdesud."

If the ticket isn't needed to implement the grace period (i.e. remembering the password for a set time) functionality in GUI sudo apps, the option "--single-shot" definitely sounds like a cleaner way to implement this.

For the CLI, I tend to agree that your suggestions 3 and 4 seem heavy, although number 4 would probably be a good solution. I can't really say anything about suggestion 2.

I came up with the same thought as your suggestion 1 also. Basically, I thought it would be useful, but while trying it out I found a serious drawback. Unfortunately, .bash\_logout is only handled for \_login\_ shells, i.e. it is not executed for inter-active shells from Konsole. (People can also remove '~/.bash\_logout', but then it's their choice. I also wondered about the case where the shell (e.g. hanged and) got terminated in an abnormal way and it couldn't execute the logout script - in this case a solution not dependent on the shell would be more reliable.)

Calling sudo -K from a GUI sudo wrapper is a bad idea. It would invalidate any tickets for other terminals as well. Solutions #2 and #4 seem reasonable. I think #2 would be easier to do, but I'm not an expert on any of this.

FYI, gksu (as of libgksu version 2.0.11) allocates a new pseudoterminal, runs sudo -v to acquire a token, then uses g\_spawn\_sync in the parent process once the authentication is successful. (This allows gksu to be executed with the 'Defaults requiretty' option, which is enabled by default on RHEL.) Obviously, this fix doesn't work properly with the tty\_tickets option. I'm going to write another patch to try and address this issue.

Until then, I wouldn't be using the new libgksu in Karmic!

I have part of idea of another workaround for pty (but not for tty).

Open console:

$ ls -l --full-time --time=ctime `tty`

crw------- 1 darkk tty 136, 2 2009-11-14 15:41:39.260720360 +0600 /dev/pts/2

Close console, open console again:

$ ls -l --full-time --time=ctime `tty`

crw------- 1 darkk tty 136, 2 2009-11-14 15:43:31.320713474 +0600 /dev/pts/2

So ticket may include ctime of pty.

On the other hand, malicious attacker can change ctime of the /dev/pts/2 and he may get correct ctime watching /dev/pts (he can't get ctime from ticket data). I don't know if it may be avoided using something like POSIX ACL's and I assume that POSIX ACL's are not supported by ptsfs. Maybe someone has better idea.

This report is now a few years old and I'm seeing an interesting behavior of sudo:

1. First I'm Cleaning /var/lib/sudo/$USER as root with "rm -rf /var/lib/sudo/sworddragon/\*".

2. Then I'm opening a terminal with my user account.

3. Typing tty returns /dev/pts/2.

4. Then I'm typing "sudo true" and entering my correct password.

5. Typing "md5sum /var/lib/sudo/sworddragon/2" as root returns "6ec673eac24f4e2fc0c5fa149eebfcef /var/lib/sudo/sworddragon/2"

6. Then I'm closing the terminal on /dev/pts/2 and opening it again.

7. Typing tty returns /dev/pts/2.

8. On typing sudo true I'm asked again for my password.

9. Instead of typing my password I'm typing now as root again "md5sum /var/lib/sudo/sworddragon/2" which returns "6ec673eac24f4e2fc0c5fa149eebfcef /var/lib/sudo/sworddragon/2".

10. Typing "ls -a /var/lib/sudo/sworddragon" as root returns ". .. 2".

This means even on getting the same pts without expiring of /var/lib/sudo/sworddragon/2 sudo asks me for my password. Can somebody tell me where is hiding the security mechanism here? Also are the cases in this ticket still a problem or are they maybe already fixed?

Sworddragon, I believe this code from plugins/sudoers/check.c in check\_user() prevents the tty reuse problem:

    if (def\_tty\_tickets && user\_ttypath && stat(user\_ttypath, &sb) == 0) {

Thanks for the answer. If I'm not wrong ctime has a nanosecond resolution. The only way to abuse this is if:

- The tty/pts gets closed.

- The time adjusts to the past (for example due to ntp).

- The next opened console/terminal gets the same number and is created exactly at the same time.

While this is theoretically possible it should only be seen as an extremely rare race-condition. Also normally while the user opens a terminal, types sudo and enters his password at least a few seconds will be gone. Normally the adjustment of ntp is only a few milliseconds. If I'm not wrong here too ntp refuses to adjust the time to a too far point.

So this is a very nice security mechanism of sudo (does gksudo build on sudo too and benefit from this?).

Hi,
the following vulnerability was published for sudo.

[CVE-2013-1776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1776)[0]:
(from the upstream report)

Sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p6 are now available which include a fix for
the following bug:

Potential bypass of sudo tty_tickets constraints

Summary:
    When a user successfully authenticates with sudo, a time stamp
    file is updated to allow that user to continue running sudo
    without requiring a password for a preset time period (five
    minutes by default).

    This time stamp file can either be common to all of a user's
    terminals, or it can be specific to the particular terminal the
    user authenticated themselves on.  The terminal-specific time
    stamp file behavior can be controlled using the "tty_tickets"
    option in the sudoers file.  This option has been enabled by
    default since sudo 1.7.4.  Prior to sudo 1.7.4, the default was
    to use a single time stamp for all the user's sessions.

    A vulnerability exists because the user can control which
    terminal the standard input, output and error file descriptors
    (0-2) refer to.  A malicious user could use this to run commands
    via sudo without authenticating, so long as there exists a
    terminal the user has access to where a sudo command was
    successfully run by that same user within the password timeout
    period (usually five minutes).

    The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other
    than those allowed by the sudoers policy.

Sudo versions affected:
    Sudo 1.3.5 through 1.7.10p6 and sudo 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p7 when
    the "tty_tickets" option is enabled.  This option is enabled
    by default in sudo 1.7.4 and above.

Details:
    The vulnerability can be triggered when the standard input,
    output and error file descriptors (0-2) of a process are closed
    and a different terminal device is opened and connected to those
    descriptors.  When sudo tries to determine the terminal device
    via the ttyname() function, it will get the name of the other
    terminal instead.  The core problem is that while ttyname() can
    be used to determine the name of the terminal device connected
    to a specific file descriptor, there is no portable way to
    determine the name of the terminal associated with the session
    the process belongs to.  However, on many systems it is possible
    to determine this by using the /proc file system or the sysctl()
    function.

    Most operating systems that have the /proc file system provide
    a way to determine the controlling terminal device number for
    a process; this information is used by the ps command for
    example.  On Linux, this is the tty_nr field in /proc/self/stat
    (the seventh entry).  On systems with an SVR4-style /proc, this
    is the pr_ttydev member of struct psinfo, which comes from
    /proc/self/psinfo.  Most BSD systems that support the sysctl()
    function also provide a way to get the terminal device number
    via the KERN_PROC_PID sysctl.  By mapping this device number
    to a file name, it is possible to get the name of the terminal
    file without resorting to ttyname().  Sudo began using this
    method to determine the process's terminal starting with version
    1.8.5 and 1.7.10.

    However, sudo still used the ttyname() function as a fall back
    when no controlling terminal was found via /proc or sysctl().
    This allowed a malicious process to cause sudo to use ttyname()
    simply by creating a new session without a controlling tty
    before executing sudo.  In sudo 1.8.6p6 and 1.7.10p5, this fall
    back behavior was removed.  This fixed the vulnerability for
    systems where the process's controlling terminal could be
    determined via /proc or sysctl().

    Sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p6 contain an additional fix for systems
    without /proc or sysctl() that stores the POSIX session ID in
    the time stamp file itself.  The controlling terminal is specific
    to the POSIX session it is associated with.  It is not possible
    for two processes in different sessions to have the same
    controlling terminal.  Sudo will now compare the current session
    ID with the one in the time stamp file and ignore the time stamp
    file if the session ID does not match.  This has the additional
    benefit of making it much less likely that a user will be able
    to reuse the time stamp file after logging out and back in again
    on the same terminal.

Impact:
    A (potentially malicious) program run by a user with sudo access
    may be able to bypass the "tty_ticket" constraints.  In order
    for this to succeed there must exist on the machine a terminal
    device that the user has previously authenticated themselves
    on via sudo within the last time stamp timeout (5 minutes by
    default).

    This program may use sudo's -n flag to "probe" the terminals
    in question to see if there is an active time stamp file for
    the user.  Prior to sudo 1.8.6 and 1.7.10, if a password was
    required when the -n flag was specified the failure would not
    be logged, allowing the program to perform such probes without
    being detected.  The successful command (if any), would still
    be logged.

Fix:
    The bug is fixed in sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p6.

Credit:
    Ryan Castellucci brought the initial ttyname() issue to my
    attention.  Subsequently, James Ogden discovered that using
    setsid() to create a new session would cause sudo to fall back
    to using ttyname().

    Other shortcomings in sudo's "tty_tickets" functionality have
    been known and discussed openly for some time.  There is a long
    discussion about them at:
	[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sudo/+bug/87023](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/sudo/%2Bbug/87023)

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.
