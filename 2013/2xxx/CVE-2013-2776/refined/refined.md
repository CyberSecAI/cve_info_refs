CVE-2013-2776:

- **Root Cause:**  Sudo did not properly validate the controlling terminal device when the `tty_tickets` option was enabled and running on systems without `/proc` or the `sysctl` function. This allowed local users with sudo permissions to hijack the authorization of another terminal.
- **Vulnerability:**  Bypass of `tty_tickets` constraints.
- **Attack Vector:** Local users with existing sudo permissions can run commands via sudo without authenticating.  This is achieved by connecting to the standard input, output, and error file descriptors of another authorized terminal.
- **Impact:**  An attacker able to run code as a local user could possibly gain additional privileges by running commands that the victim user was allowed to run via sudo, without knowing the victim's password.
- **Affected Versions:** Sudo 1.3.5 through 1.7.10p5 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p6 when running on systems without `/proc` or the `sysctl` function with the `tty_tickets` option enabled.
- **Fix:** Store the session ID in the tty ticket file itself. The controlling terminal is specific to the POSIX session it is associated with. Sudo will now compare the current session ID with the one in the time stamp file and ignore the time stamp file if the session ID does not match. Fixed in sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p6.
