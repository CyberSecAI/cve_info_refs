Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- FileMaker Pro fails to properly verify SSL server certificates when establishing encrypted communication with the FileMaker Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can be carried out.
- Attackers can eavesdrop on encrypted communication between FileMaker Pro and the FileMaker Server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is conducted over the network.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic, typically by being on the same network as the client or by being in a position to intercept traffic routed through them.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a MitM attack, which typically requires some level of expertise and possibly social engineering.
- The user needs to be convinced to take a standard action that does not feel harmful, such as clicking on a link or viewing a file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in FileMaker Pro versions 12 and earlier and FileMaker Pro Advanced versions 12 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was not addressed in FileMaker Pro 12 and FileMaker Pro Advanced 12.
- The vulnerability is fixed in FileMaker Pro 13 and FileMaker Pro Advanced 13.
- The JVN analysis indicates that the severity is High due to access and authentication conditions. The user interaction required is considered Mid. The exploit complexity is considered Mid-High.
