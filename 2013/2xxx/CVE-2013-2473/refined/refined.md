{
  "CVE-2013-2473": {
    "description": "It was discovered that the ByteBandedRaster class of the 2D component did not properly verify that the data buffer size fits the raster attributes. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.",
    "root_cause": "The ByteBandedRaster class in the 2D component of OpenJDK does not properly check if the data buffer size matches the raster attributes, leading to potential memory corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper data size validation",
       "Incorrect bounds checks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could use an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions due to incorrect data size verification, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other unspecified impact. Other impacts are VM memory corruption, denial of service, and sensitive information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Untrusted Java application",
      "Untrusted Java applet"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to execute an untrusted Java application or applet"
  }
