Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-2810:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper protection against TCP replay attacks within the Emerson ROC800 RTU.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the susceptibility to **Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay**. Specifically, a TCP replay attack can be used to replay captured network traffic, causing the device to execute commands not intended by the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the ROC800 device. This can lead to a complete compromise of the device's integrity and functionality, resulting in:
* Device Disablement.
* Device Compromise.
* Remote Code Execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to be able to capture network traffic to and from a valid user or the ROC800 device and then resend the captured packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be positioned on the network to capture legitimate network communications and then have the ability to replay these captured packets to the targeted ROC800 device. The attacker does not need prior authentication to execute the replay attack, hence the "Authentication Bypass" aspect.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
* The advisory mentions that no known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is considered easy to exploit, requiring only low-level attacker skill.
* CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned.
* The advisory also lists several other vulnerabilities affecting the same device.
