Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-2122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Drupal "Edit Limit" module does not sufficiently check user access when editing comments. Specifically, it fails to verify if a user has the necessary permissions to edit a comment outside the limits imposed by the module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Access Bypass:** The primary weakness is an access bypass, where users can circumvent the intended restrictions of the module.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The module lacks proper access control checks to ensure users can only edit comments they are authorized to modify.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A user with the "edit comments" permission can edit the comments of any other user on the Drupal site, even if the "Edit Limit" module should restrict them.
- This can lead to unauthorized modification of content, potentially including sensitive information or disruption of the site's content integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation through the Drupal web interface.
- An attacker needs to have a valid account on the Drupal site with the "edit comments" permission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must have a user account on the affected Drupal site.
- The attacker's user account must have the "edit comments" permission.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in Edit Limit module versions prior to 7.x-1.3.
- Drupal core is not affected.
- The vulnerability was reported by Morten Fangel and fixed by Quade (module maintainer).
