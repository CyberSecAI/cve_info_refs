Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-2482:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The AMQP dissector is susceptible to an infinite loop condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By sending a malformed AMQP packet, an attacker can cause Wireshark to enter an infinite loop, leading to excessive CPU resource consumption and potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malformed AMQP packet can be injected onto the network.
- An attacker could also convince a user to open a malformed packet capture file containing the malicious AMQP packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject network packets or to create a malformed pcap file.
- The attacker does not need privileged access to the target machine, just needs to get a malformed pcap file or inject a packet that will be processed by Wireshark.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was discovered by Moshe Kaplan.
- The affected versions of Wireshark include 1.8.0 to 1.8.5 and 1.6.0 to 1.6.13
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Wireshark versions 1.8.6 and 1.6.14.
