Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `cremefraiche` Ruby gem directly passing unsanitized user-provided file names to the command line via the `system()` function. This occurs when constructing the command to update PDF metadata using `pdftk`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. By crafting a file name containing shell meta characters, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands that will be executed on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server where the `cremefraiche` gem is used. This gives the attacker full control of the server, with capabilities to:
  - Access and modify data.
  - Install malware.
  - Disrupt services.
  - Potentially pivot to other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Email Attachments:** If the application converts email attachments to PDF, an attacker could embed shell meta characters in the filename of a malicious email attachment.
- **Web GUI File Input:** If the application allows users to upload or specify file names via a web interface, an attacker could inject commands through this input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Input:** The attacker must be able to provide input that becomes part of the file name passed to the `pdftk` command. This could be achieved through:
  - Sending a specially crafted email attachment to the vulnerable application.
  - Interacting with a vulnerable web interface or API that allows file name specification.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application/Code:** The attacker would likely need to understand how the application uses the `cremefraiche` gem and its reliance on user-provided file names for PDF processing.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 0.6.1 of the `cremefraiche` gem.
- The vendor was notified and promptly provided a fix.
- The advisory provides a link for more detailed information regarding the vulnerability.
