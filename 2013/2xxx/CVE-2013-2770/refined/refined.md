- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Novell Kanaka for Mac 2.7 installation process trusts any SSL certificate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure handling of SSL certificates during installation, allowing any certificate to be trusted without validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially steal credentials by intercepting or manipulating the SSL connection during the installation process.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack during the installation process. An attacker would need to be positioned on the network to intercept the connection between the client and server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access during the installation process, allowing them to intercept communications.
