Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of URL fragments within the `uploadify` and `flowplayer` SWF files used by Gallery3. Specifically, the application failed to strip URL fragments when these SWF files were accessed directly via URL requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization of URL parameters when accessing the SWF files directly, allowing arbitrary data to be appended via URL fragments.
*   **Replay Attacks:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to replay a request by using URL fragments, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Replay Attacks:** A remote attacker could conduct replay attacks by exploiting the lack of URL fragment stripping. The exact impact would depend on the functionality of the SWF files and what they were used for.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Requests:** The attack vector involves sending direct URL requests to the vulnerable `uploadify` and `flowplayer` SWF files, including malicious URL fragments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote from the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints:** The attacker must know or guess the URLs where the vulnerable SWF files reside.
*   **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to create URLs that include the desired fragment for the replay attack.

**More Details than CVE Description:**

The provided content gives significantly more detail than the basic CVE description. Specifically, it provides:

*   **Specific vulnerable files:** It identifies the exact SWF files (`uploadify.swf`, `flowplayer.swf`, etc.) and their associated PHP files that are vulnerable.
*   **Fixing commits:** Links are provided to the specific commits in the Gallery3 repository that address the issue, showcasing the fixes.
*   **Code level details:** The commit diffs show that the fix involves adding PHP code to the files associated with vulnerable SWF files to strip off any query parameters and redirect to the original URL without the query parameters, preventing replay attacks.
*   **Impacted Gallery3 versions:** It specifies that Fedora 17, 18 and EPEL-6 are affected.
*  **Detailed description of the flaw:** The description details the improper stripping of URL fragments and the possibility of replay attacks.
*   **Upstream Tickets**: Links to the corresponding upstream tickets on the gallery project's sourceforge are provided.
