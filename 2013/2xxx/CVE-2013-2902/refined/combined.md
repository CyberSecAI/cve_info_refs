Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2013/08/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, August 20, 2013

The Chrome team is excited to announce the promotion of Chrome 29 to the Stable channel for Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome Frame. Â Chrome 29.0.1547.57 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* Improved Omnibox suggestions based on the recency of sites you have visited
* Ability to reset your profile back to its original state
* Many new apps and extensions APIs
* Lots of stability and performance improvements

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. This commonly occurs if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but havenâ€™t yet fixed.*

This update includes [25 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0+label%3AM-29+-OS%3DAndroid+-Security_Severity%3DNone+&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Iteration+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight some fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or particularly interesting. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.
