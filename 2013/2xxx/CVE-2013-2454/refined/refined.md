{
  "CVE-2013-2454": {
    "Root cause": "The SerialJavaObject class in the JDBC component of OpenJDK did not properly restrict access to certain class packages.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control",
      "Improper restriction of operations within the sandbox"
    ],
    "Impact": "An untrusted Java application or applet could bypass Java sandbox restrictions and potentially gain access to sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Untrusted Java applets or applications",
       "Specifically crafted serialized objects"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to execute an untrusted Java application or applet"
    ,
    "Notes": "The vulnerability lies in the way the `SerialJavaObject` class handles serialized objects and their access to class packages. The fix involves improved package access restrictions to prevent unauthorized access via the class."
