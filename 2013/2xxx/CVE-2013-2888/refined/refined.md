```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Linux kernel HID (Human Interface Device) subsystem does not properly handle HID reports with an out-of-bounds Report ID.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory corruption due to an out-of-bounds write, potentially leading to heap memory corruption.
- Impact of exploitation: System crash (denial of service) or potentially privilege escalation on the system.
- Attack vectors: Physical access to the system is required.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be physically present to attach a specially crafted HID device to the system.
