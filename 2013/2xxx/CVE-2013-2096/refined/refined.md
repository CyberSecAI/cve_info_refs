Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the virtual size of QCOW2 images used as ephemeral storage in OpenStack Nova.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Nova did not check the virtual size of QCOW2 images. This allows a user to create a small image with a large declared virtual size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious user could create an image with a large virtual size, but small actual data, then fill the virtual disk once the instance is created, consuming all available disk space on the host node file system.
- This could result in a denial of service on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated user with the ability to upload images and launch instances.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with permissions to create images and launch instances in the OpenStack environment.
