Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of string filtering within the Login Security module when soft blocking is disabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect String Filtering:** The module uses flawed string filtering mechanisms which can be manipulated to bypass all login checks.
- **Logic Error:** The logic flaw allows an attacker to skip the security checks implemented by the module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the login security features, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the input during the login process to exploit the flawed string filtering mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to attempt a login, meaning they need to access the login form of the affected application.
- The attacker must be aware of the specific weakness within the module's string filtering logic.
