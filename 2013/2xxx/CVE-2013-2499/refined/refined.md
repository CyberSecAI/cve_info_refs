Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way user cookies are generated in Simple HRM system. The system creates a cookie based on the MD5 hash of a combination of the user's ID, username, and password hash. This means that if an attacker can obtain the user's password hash, they can trivially generate a valid session cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Generation:** The core weakness lies in using the MD5 hash of the user ID, username, and password hash to create the session cookie. This method is vulnerable because if the password hash is compromised, the cookie can be easily spoofed.
*   **Lack of Proper Session Management:** The system lacks proper measures for verifying the validity of session cookies. The cookie is simply generated and trusted for subsequent access without any proper verification or expiration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Impersonation:** An attacker who obtains a user's password hash can easily craft a valid session cookie and impersonate the user, gaining full access to the account and its associated privileges.
*   **Complete System Access:** By compromising a user account, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify the application, and/or compromise the entire system.
*   **Circumvention of Password Hashing:** This vulnerability effectively bypasses the security benefits of password hashing. While passwords are not stored in plaintext, the hashing method used to generate the cookie makes the hash just as usable for malicious access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection (CVE-2013-2498):** The provided text shows how this vulnerability is made significantly worse by CVE-2013-2498. The SQL injection vulnerability allows the attacker to retrieve the password hashes from the database to create the spoofed cookie.
*   **Password Hash Theft:** Any method of obtaining the user's password hash, whether through database access, social engineering, or other means, could be used to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to obtain a user's password hash:** This is a pre-requisite to crafting a valid session cookie. This can be done through the SQL injection vulnerability mentioned or any other means that compromises the password hash.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft a valid cookie that is sent to the Simple HRM application.

**Additional Notes**
The content provides significantly more detail than the original CVE description, outlining the specific method of cookie generation and the ease with which a malicious user can use this information to take over a user account.
