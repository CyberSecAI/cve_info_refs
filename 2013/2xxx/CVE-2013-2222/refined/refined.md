Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2013-2222:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by multiple stack-based buffer overflows due to insufficient validation of the size of certain fields within a malformed ZRTP Hello packet. Specifically, the count of public keys can be manipulated to trigger the overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple stack-based buffer overflows.
- Lack of proper input validation on the size of public keys field within ZRTP Hello packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application. Although, the provided information suggests that exploitation may be challenging due to the nature of stack memory layout.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malformed ZRTP Hello packet with an oversized value in the fields controlling the count of public keys.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted ZRTP packets to the vulnerable application. This suggests that a network-adjacent position is likely required.
