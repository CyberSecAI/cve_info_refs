Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free issue within the input handling mechanism of the Chromium browser. Specifically, when focusing on multiple-fields input types (like date and time inputs) during an unload event, the browser could potentially access freed memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free condition. The `Document::m_focusedNode` could refer to an element no longer part of the document tree after dispatching unload events. This also occurs within `BaseMultipleFieldsDateAndTimeInputType::didBlurFromControl`, where the element might lose its last reference due to `setFocus(false)`. A re-entrancy issue was also present when the `destroyShadowSubtree` could dispatch a blur event unexpectedly due to incorrect focus information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact is a browser crash, as evidenced by the commit message "Fix crash by focusing multiple-fields input types during an unload event."
- **Potential for more severe impact:** While the primary identified impact is a crash, use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for more serious exploits like arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully control the memory layout and content after the memory is freed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the page unload event when multiple-fields input types are focused. This suggests that a crafted web page, that triggers the focus and unload event in a specific order, is needed to reproduce the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafted web page:** An attacker needs to be able to serve or inject a malicious web page. The web page needs to contain a multiple-field input (like a time input) and trigger a focus on this input right before the unload event.
- **User interaction (potentially):** It's implied that user interaction (e.g., clicking or tabbing to focus the input) might be needed, but the exact required interaction isn't fully clear.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Chromium version 28.0.1500.95.
- The fix involved changes to `ContainerNode::removeChildren`, `Document::implicitOpen`, and `BaseMultipleFieldsDateAndTimeInputType::didBlurFromControl` and `destroyShadowSubtree`
- The commits related to the fix include additional tests that reproduce the bug to avoid future regressions
- This vulnerability was discovered by Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team.
