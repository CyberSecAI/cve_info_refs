Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2064:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the `read_packet()` function within the `libxcb` library when calculating the size of incoming responses from an X server.
*   **Weakness:** The `read_packet()` function multiplies a 32-bit integer length value received from the server by 4 and adds it to a default response size. This calculation is performed without proper overflow checks. If the length value is large enough, the multiplication can result in an integer overflow.
*   **Impact:** This overflow leads to the allocation of a buffer smaller than the amount of data the server is sending. When the data is written into the buffer, it results in a heap buffer overflow. This could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious or compromised X server could send a crafted response with a large length field, triggering the overflow in a connected X client application using `libxcb`.

**2. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the function `read_packet()` of `libxcb`.
*   The core of the vulnerability is the calculation of the size of the incoming data, done without proper checks that might lead to an integer overflow.
*   The size is calculated by multiplying the length provided by the server (`int32_t length`) by 4, and then adding a default size.
*   The commit `1b33867f` addresses the integer overflow in `read_packet()`.
*   The fix ensures that the calculation does not result in an overflow, preventing undersized memory allocation.

**3. Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Position:** The attacker needs control over an X server, not necessarily the local server. A user could, for example, set up a malicious virtual X server (like Xvfb or Xephyr).
*   **Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary (malicious) response data, specifically controlling the length field, to a client using `libxcb`.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability can enable privilege escalation in specific scenarios. If a setuid X client is connected to a malicious unprivileged X server, the server can send responses that overflow buffers in the privileged client, leading to the client's compromise.

**4. Affected Versions:**

*   `libxcb` versions 1.9 and earlier are vulnerable.
*   The fix is included in `libxcb` version 1.9.1.

**5. Fix Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding checks for integer overflow in the `read_packet()` function.
*   The fix is available in git commit [1b33867f](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxcb/-/commit/1b33867fa996034deb50819ae54640be501f8d20)
*   The fix is included in `libxcb` version 1.9.1.

**6.  Additional Information:**

*   The issue was discovered by Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive.
*   Alan Coopersmith of Oracle developed the fix.
*   This vulnerability is one of multiple issues discovered in X client libraries.
*   Versions of X libraries built on top of XCB are affected, although the added checks within XCB reduce the attack surface in some cases, the checks are not sufficient to prevent most of these vulnerabilities.
