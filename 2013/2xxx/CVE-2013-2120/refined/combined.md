Subject: KDE Paste Applet

The paste applet included with kdeplasma-addons allows you to define
macros that will copy some generated data into the clipboard, using
simple macros to define the source and format of the data.

The available macros include %{password(...)} which generates "random"
passwords.

Here is the code that generates the passwords (from pastemacroexpander.cpp):

    QDateTime now = QDateTime::currentDateTime();
    qsrand(now.toTime_t() / now.time().msec());
    for (int i = 0; i < charCount; ++i) {
        result += chars[qrand() % chars.count()];
    }

Breaking passwords generated by this (for example from leaked password
hashes) can be done extremely quickly, especially if a password expiry
or other hint is stored with the password.

Workaround: You can change the macro you were using to a %{exec(...)}
macro which calls a secure password generator.  Please select your
replacement carefully.

I reported this to security@....org and created a launchpad ticket
against the Ubuntu package on May 13, followed up with a proof of
concept on the 17th, and have received no response at all from either.
 Apologies if that was the wrong contact method.

Regards,
  Michael

KRandom is just rand(), so there's only 2^32 > possible seeds.  Thanks, Michael. Checking with Aaron J. Seigo, original [CVE-2013-2120](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2120) patch author, what could be done to strengthen the patch yet (you were Cc-ed on that post).  Regards, Jan.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=969421#c10)  Michael Samuel    2013-06-21 09:58:10 UTC  ``` I have a patch based on qca::random(), but was waiting for contact from KDE people, as I wasn't sure if qca needed some special initialization.  Also, the numbers charset has '0' twice - one of them needs to be removed.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=969421#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-06-11 21:05:07 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2013-2120>   ``` |  |
