Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-2120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `PasteMacroExpander` in the `kdeplasma-addons` package used a weak method for generating "random" passwords when using the `%{password(...)}` macro.
- The password generation was based on seeding a pseudo-random number generator (`qsrand`) with the current timestamp, specifically `now.toTime_t() / now.time().msec()`. This seed was predictable or had a low entropy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Predictable Random Number Generation:** The pseudo-random number generator was seeded using a value derived from the current time, which is easily guessable, especially if the attacker has some information or hint about the password generation time.
- **Modulo Bias:** The code used the modulo operator (`%`) with `qrand()` which may have introduced a slight bias, further weakening the generated passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Plaintext Password Exposure:** An attacker, by reverse-engineering the password generation process, could easily determine the "random" passwords generated by the paste applet.
- **Unauthorized Access:**  Compromised passwords could lead to unauthorized access to services or resources intended to be protected by such passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Password Generation:** An attacker would need to know that a user is using the vulnerable password generation macro.
- **Password Hash Leakage:** If the generated passwords were used as password hashes, the attacker could use a password cracker to quickly reveal the passwords, if they had a hash or a hint about the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Knowledge of the vulnerable macro, the `%{password(...)}` in the KDE paste applet.
- Understanding of the password generation algorithm.
- Some knowledge about when the password was created, if needed to reduce search space for the seed.

**Additional Notes:**

- The initial fix of using `KRandom()` was also deemed insufficient as it uses `rand()` internally which is also not cryptographically strong.
- A later, more robust fix was proposed based on `qca::random()`.
