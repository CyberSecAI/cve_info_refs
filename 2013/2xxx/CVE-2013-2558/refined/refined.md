The provided content discusses a TrueType font fuzzing technique used to discover vulnerabilities. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2013-2558, it does describe a vulnerability discovery process that could potentially lead to the identification of such flaws. The content focuses on the fuzzing approach, the structure of TrueType fonts, and the tools used in the process, including an automated font installation, display and removal methodology.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The root cause is related to malformed or unexpected data within TrueType font files, leading to a crash when processed by the Windows graphics subsystem. The fuzzing targets the size of the font as a means to triggering the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The weakness lies in the Windows TrueType font parsing implementation, specifically its vulnerability to unexpected font data sizes that were being fuzzed, leading to a crash (BSOD). The specific vulnerability is not named in the article but it is clear the general vulnerability is present when parsing the font.

**Impact of Exploitation**: The primary impact is a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), causing a denial of service on the system.

**Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted TrueType font file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malformed font file and have it processed by the vulnerable system. This could be achieved through various means, such as embedding the font in a document or a website, or getting a user to install it directly.
