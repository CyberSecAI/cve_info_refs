Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2860:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free: A memory location is accessed after it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior. This occurs when a worker process accesses database APIs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The primary impact is that the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service.
- Unspecified other impact: The advisory also notes the possibility of "unspecified other impact," suggesting potential for more severe consequences, such as arbitrary code execution, though this isn't explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Vectors involving access to a database API by a worker process: The specific attack vector involves the interaction of worker processes with database APIs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can be remote, indicating this is exploitable through network interactions or malicious web pages.
-  Ability to trigger the use-after-free condition related to database API access by a worker process.
