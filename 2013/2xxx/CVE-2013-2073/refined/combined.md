| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c0)  Florian Weimer    2013-04-15 11:13:04 UTC  ``` I configured /usr/bin/tx to use a server whose certificate is not signed by a trusted CA, and the program still submitted the HTTP request.  Since https:// URLs are strongly recommended by upstream <<http://help.transifex.com/features/client/index.html#init>>, this constitutes a security issue.  Fixing and disclosing this issue needs to be coordinated with upstream and the Red Hat Security Response Team.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-10 13:53:30 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2013-2073](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2073) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c11)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-10 14:48:22 UTC  ``` It was found that Transifex command-line client, a command line tool for Transifex translation management, did not perform X.509 certificate verification when using secured SSL connection. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof a Transifex server via an arbitrary certificate.  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c12)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-10 14:52:16 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the transifex-client package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17 and 18.  --  This issue affects the versions of the transifex-client package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL-5 and Fedora EPEL-6.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c14)  Apostolis Bessas    2013-05-14 12:40:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 747678](attachment.cgi?id=747678&action=diff "Suggested solution for validating SSL certificates in the client") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=747678&action=edit "Suggested solution for validating SSL certificates in the client") Suggested solution for validating SSL certificates in the client   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c15)  Apostolis Bessas    2013-05-14 12:46:36 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 747678](attachment.cgi?id=747678&action=diff "Suggested solution for validating SSL certificates in the client") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=747678&action=edit "Suggested solution for validating SSL certificates in the client") Suggested solution for validating SSL certificates in the client  We have had some issues with the windows package, so we had to change the patch.  The new version drops the dependency on requests (so that the client is self-contained) and instead uses the same mechanism as requests to verify a SSL certificate.   The list of root certificates is taken from Mozilla and will be shipped along with the client. The file is licensed under GPLv2, too.  The patch also uses <https://bitbucket.org/brandon/backports.ssl_match_hostname/overview>, which is licensed under the MIT license, which is also compatible with GPLv2.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c16)  Florian Weimer    2013-05-15 07:08:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c14)) > Created [attachment 747678](attachment.cgi?id=747678&action=diff "Suggested solution for validating SSL certificates in the client") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=747678&action=edit "Suggested solution for validating SSL certificates in the client") > Suggested solution for validating SSL certificates in the client  match_hostname has a minor vulnerability.  We should work with Python upstream to disclose/fix this ASAP, so that you don't have to fix your own copy.  For Fedora, we really don't want to ship yet another copy of the root certificate list.  If you could try the paths /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem and /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt first before switching to the built-in list, that would help us avoid patching.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c18)  Florian Weimer    2013-05-15 11:04:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c17)) > (In reply to [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c16)) > > match_hostname has a minor vulnerability.

I had a quick look to see how the check is implemented and it seems there is an issue with the fix.  I may be reading the code incorrect, but it seems transifex-client does:  - verify_ssl opens connection to the target host and verifies provided certificate, including name check - connection opened by verify_ssl is closed immediately - actual communication with the server is done via urllib2, which opens its own connection(s)  It seems all data flows though an unverified connection.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c27)  Tomas Hoger    2013-10-30 10:15:50 UTC  ``` Opened upstream bug: <https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/issues/42>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c28)  Apostolis Bessas    2013-12-04 13:39:02 UTC  ``` The client now uses the urllib3 package, which does the SSL verification on opening a request. The changes can be found in the 0.10 version.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=952194#c29)  Vincent Danen    2013-12-13 17:35:56 UTC  ``` See [bug #1043002](show_bug.cgi?id=1043002 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2013-7110 transifex-client: incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2073"), which is for the "incomplete fix of this CVE" (CVE assignment pending).   ``` |  |

Subject: CVE-2013-2073 transifex-client: Does not validate HTTPS server
 certificate (fixed in transifex-client v0.9)

Hello Steve, vendors,

  It was found that Transifex command-line client, a command line tool for Transifex
translation management, did not perform X.509 certificate verification when using
secured SSL connection. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof
a Transifex server via an arbitrary certificate.

The CVE identifier of CVE-2013-2073 has been allocated to this issue.

Acknowledgements:
  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.

  Red Hat would like to thank Apostolis Bessas and Ilias Vrachnis of Transifex
  for prompt replies and patches.

Fixed in: transifex-client v0.9:
            <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transifex-client/0.9>
            <http://blog.transifex.com/post/51072109836/new-version-of-the-transifex-client-has-been-released>

Upstream patches are as follows:
[1] <https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/commit/e24ea954373874962f22f63a7311d04d6ff56d84>
