Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The transifex-client, a command-line tool for Transifex translation management, did not perform proper X.509 certificate verification when establishing secured SSL connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of HTTPS server certificate validation. Specifically, the client did not verify the X.509 certificate of the server it was connecting to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof a Transifex server by presenting an arbitrary, attacker-controlled certificate. This could allow the attacker to intercept or modify data being transmitted between the client and the legitimate Transifex server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack: An attacker positioned between the client and the legitimate Transifex server could intercept the connection and present a fraudulent certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the Transifex server. This could be achieved through network access or compromise of a network device.
- The attacker must be able to present a valid but illegitimate SSL certificate to the client.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of the `transifex-client` package shipped with Fedora 17 and 18, as well as Fedora EPEL-5 and EPEL-6.
- The vulnerability was fixed in transifex-client version 0.9.
- The fix involved implementing proper SSL certificate verification. Initially, the fix included bundling a root certificate list, but later it was modified to use distro-specific paths to SSL certificate bundles (/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem and /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt) where available to avoid shipping duplicate lists.
-  A subsequent issue regarding the initial fix was discovered (CVE-2013-7110), where the certificate verification was performed, but the actual connection used for communication was not properly protected, this was later addressed with the use of the `urllib3` library.
