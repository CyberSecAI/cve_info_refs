{
  "cveId": "CVE-2013-2567",
  "description": "Zavio IP cameras use the Boa web server. The configuration file 'boa.conf' contains a hardcoded username 'manufacture' and password 'erutcafunam' that can be used to access the 'manufacture.cgi' and 'wireless_mft.cgi' files. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass the web interface authentication.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The use of hard-coded credentials in the 'boa.conf' file of the Boa web server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials"
    ],
    "impact": "Bypass of user web interface authentication, allowing unauthorized access to administrative functions.",
    "attackVectors": "Remote, over the network, via HTTP requests to the web interface.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "No authentication required; an attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable device."
  },
  "additionalDetails": "The hardcoded credentials 'manufacture'/'erutcafunam' are not visible through the user web interface, and users are unable to remove this account. This account provides access to the 'manufacture.cgi' and 'wireless_mft.cgi' files."
