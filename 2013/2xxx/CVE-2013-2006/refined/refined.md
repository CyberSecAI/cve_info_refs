{
  "CVE-2013-2006": {
    "Description": "OpenStack keystone LDAP password disclosure in log files.",
    "Root cause": "The LDAP password and admin_token were not marked as 'secret' in the configuration, causing them to be logged in plain text when DEBUG level logging was enabled.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Sensitive information (LDAP password and admin_token) not treated as secret.",
      "Logging of sensitive information in plain text.",
       "Lack of proper configuration management practices"
    ],
    "Impact": "Disclosure of sensitive LDAP password and admin_token, potentially leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker with access to the server logs could obtain the credentials. Logs would need to be at debug level for this to be possible.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the file system where OpenStack Keystone logs are stored. Debug level logging would also need to be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploited."
