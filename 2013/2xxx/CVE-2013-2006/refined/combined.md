### Bug Description

The password configuration of LDAP and admin\_token in keystone.conf should be secret to protect security information:

[ldap]

# url = ldap://localhost

# user = dc=Manager,dc=example,dc=com

# password = None <- should be secrect

# suffix = cn=example,cn=com

# use\_dumb\_member = False

# allow\_subtree\_delete = False

# dumb\_member = cn=dumb,dc=example,dc=com

[DEFAULT]

admin\_token = passw0rd <- should be secrect

Kurt, proposed patch only sets oslo.config.cfg secret attribute:

        :param secret: true iff the value should be obfuscated in log output

This does not hide the password values in the config file, just prevents leakage in the logfile.

Ok the CVE I assigned (CVE-2013-1977 as per <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q2/126>) covers the default devstack (git clone <https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git> ; cd devstack && ./stack.sh ) which creates:

drwxr-xr-x. 3 stack root 4096 Apr 19 18:39 /etc/keystone

-rw-rw-r--. 1 stack stack 10251 Apr 19 18:33 /etc/keystone/keystone.conf

which exposes the above secrets. If things are ALSO exposed in the log files that a second security issue as well and I'll assign a CVE for it.

There is a bit of confusion around this bug. There are two issues:

1/ LDAP password is specified in a world-readable file

This is not a Keystone issue. This is a packaging/deployment issue: that file should not be deployed world-readable. At most that would be a devstack issue (although I don't think anyone ever relied on devstack to deploy openstack in any kind of secure fashion) -- and the CVE should be updated to reflect that.

2/ LDAP password config option is not marked "secret" so it MAY show in logs

That's what the proposed fix actually fixes. I'm not sure the LDAp password is actually logged anywhere, but marking it secret actually makes sure it would not show if that was the case. This should be filed as a separate bug.

Happy to create an OSSN for issue 1, keystone.conf world readable.

Issue 2, ldap creds being set to secret: I think I'm right in saying a fix is in place, is that backported?

DRAFT: Keystone configuration should not be world readable

---

### Summary ###

In some deployments keystone.conf which contains confidential information, is set to world readable.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Keystone, DevStack

### Discussion ###

It is important that deployers of OpenStack ensure that keystone.conf is not world readable. In some deployments the keystone configuration file is readable by all users (and processes) on the installation system.

### Recommended Actions ###

Ensure that in your deployment keystone.conf is not world readable.

### Discussion ###

It is important that deployers of OpenStack ensure that keystone.conf is not world readable. In some deployments the keystone configuration file is readable by all users (and processes) on the installation system. This file should be set with the most restrictive permissions that allow the system to continue proper operations.

In particular, the password configuration of the LDAP section and the admin\_token contain secret information:

---- being example config snippet ----

[ldap]

url = ldap://localhost

user = dc=Manager,dc=example,dc=com

password = None <- should be secret

suffix = cn=example,cn=com

use\_dumb\_member = False

allow\_subtree\_delete = False

dumb\_member = cn=dumb,dc=example,dc=com

[DEFAULT]

admin\_token = passw0rd <- should be secret

---- end example config snippet ----

### Recommended Actions ###

Ensure that in your deployment keystone.conf uses the most restrictive permissions that allow the system to continue proper operations.

Keystone configuration should not be world readable

---

### Summary ###

In some deployments keystone.conf which contains confidential information, is set to world readable.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Keystone, DevStack

### Discussion ###

It is important that deployers of OpenStack ensure that keystone.conf is not world readable. In some deployments the keystone configuration file is readable by all users (and processes) on the installation system. This file should be set with the most restrictive permissions that allow the system to continue proper operations.

In particular, the password configuration of the LDAP section and the admin\_token contain secret information:

---- being example config snippet ----

[ldap]

url = ldap://localhost

user = dc=Manager,dc=example,dc=com

password = None <- should be secret

suffix = cn=example,cn=com

use\_dumb\_member = False

allow\_subtree\_delete = False

dumb\_member = cn=dumb,dc=example,dc=com

[DEFAULT]

admin\_token = passw0rd <- should be secret

---- end example config snippet ----

### Recommended Actions ###

Ensure that in your deployment keystone.conf uses the most restrictive permissions that allow the system to continue proper operations.

Hi,

FYI, I don't think Debian is affected by this issue, since both keystone.conf and the log files are owned by the keystone users, and aren't world readable. At least, that's what I can see in my POC.

### Bug Description

This is a by-product of [bug 1168252](/bugs/1168252).

Keystone auth\_token and LDAP password are not market "secret" so they appear in DEBUG level logs:

(keystone-all): 2013-04-23 23:17:09,101 DEBUG cfg log\_opt\_values admin\_token = 111222333444

(keystone-all): 2013-04-23 23:17:09,108 DEBUG cfg log\_opt\_values ldap.password = None

# RHSA-2013:0806 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Low: openstack-keystone security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0806)

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and various
bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
Catalog, and Policy services.

These updated packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2012.2.4,
which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#950132)

This update also fixes the following security issue:

In environments using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), if
debug-level logging was enabled (for example, by enabling it in
"/etc/keystone/keystone.conf"), the LDAP server password was logged in
plain text to a world-readable log file. Debug-level logging is not enabled
by default. (CVE-2013-2006)

Additionally, this update also fixes the following bugs:

* If the Keystone service incurred an HTTP error as a result of a transient

network error, authentication tokens were listed as invalid. With this
update, the Keystone service will now retry requests a few times before
failing, which masks transient network errors. (BZ#919526)

* The "/var/log/keystone/" directory was world-readable. With this update,

world-read permissions have been removed. (BZ#956474)

All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted
automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
