Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a file descriptor (FD) leakage in the Monkey HTTPD web server when running CGI programs. The server does not properly close file descriptors after a CGI program is executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **File Descriptor Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is that the Monkey HTTPD server leaks file descriptors when executing CGI programs. These FDs are related to network sockets and other internal server resources. Specifically, eventpoll file descriptors are leaked, along with pipes used for communication.
- **Insecure Handling of FDs:** The server fails to properly manage and close FDs after the CGI process has completed, leading to the leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** A malicious CGI program could exploit this by repeatedly opening and leaking file descriptors until the server runs out of available FDs. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the server unable to handle new connections or requests.
- **Control of Server Response:** A malicious CGI program could potentially manipulate the leaked network socket file descriptor to take control of the server's request/response process. The CGI process can read or write directly to the sockets that Monkey is using, effectively hijacking existing connections.
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, file descriptor leaks can also sometimes be leveraged for local privilege escalation depending on what FDs are leaked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CGI Execution:** The primary attack vector is through the execution of malicious CGI programs on a server running the vulnerable Monkey HTTPD.
- **Network Access:** An attacker would need to have access to a way to trigger the vulnerable CGI script, usually by a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Execute CGI:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute a CGI program on the vulnerable server. This could be via a web request, if the server is configured to execute CGI scripts from a location the attacker can reach.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Felipe Pena who observed the leaked FDs via `ls -lah /proc/<pid>/fd/` on the CGI process.
*   The leaked file descriptors include pipes, sockets, and eventpoll inodes.
*   Specifically mentioned were file descriptors 0 (read pipe), 1 (write pipe), 2 (/dev/null), 3 and 9 (sockets), and 10-19 (eventpoll inodes).
*   The issue was tracked in the Monkey project's bug tracker as ticket #187.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2013-2183

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered a local security bypass and has a CVSS v3 score of 7.1 (High).
- Although initially reported as a critical issue it seems to have been later downgraded as "Normal minor" issue on Gentoo and "Medium" priority on Ubuntu.
- There is some indication that the issue was fixed by upstream, but there are contradictory comments about the resolution and specific affected versions.
- Gentoo maintainers had trouble reproducing the issue.
- The Debian tracker marks the issue as unfixed in unstable release.

In summary, CVE-2013-2183 describes a file descriptor leakage vulnerability in the Monkey HTTPD server when executing CGI programs. This vulnerability allows attackers to exhaust server resources leading to denial of service or gain control over the server request/response process.
