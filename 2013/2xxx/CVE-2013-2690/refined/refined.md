Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `index.php` file of the SynConnect PMS (Property Management Software) application. Specifically, the `loginid` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `loginid` parameter, which is directly used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Error-Based SQL Injection:** The exploit uses error-based techniques to extract information by observing the database errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can steal the entire database, which includes sensitive information like:
    *   Master admin credentials.
    *   Guest's personal and confidential information.
*   **Account Impersonation:** By obtaining admin credentials, an attacker gains control of guest accounts and can impersonate their identities.
*   **Full System Control:** The ability to log in to the admin portal could lead to overall control of the system, beyond just the guest accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a malicious `loginid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges or prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is needed to craft the exploit.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `loginid`
*   **Vulnerable Module:** `index.php?func=logoff&loginid=`
*   **Example Exploit:** `http://localhost/index.php?func=logoff&loginid=1011' AND (SELECT 8975 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT((SELECT MID((IFNULL(CAST(schema_name AS CHAR),0x20)),1,50) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA LIMIT 6,1),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CHARACTER_SETS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'bhdresh'='bhdresh`
*   **Affected Version:** Version 2.0 of SynConnect PMS
*   The advisory provides details on the SQL error logs demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   The advisory also notes the existence of user, group, and package master tables, as well as payment and other modules. This suggests the potential for significant information exposure.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS severity rating of 7.3, indicating a high-risk vulnerability.
