{
  "CVE-2013-2634": {
    "Description": "An information leak in the Linux kernel's dcb netlink interface was discovered. A local user could obtain sensitive information by examining kernel stack memory.",
    "Root cause": "The Data Center Bridging (DCB) netlink interface in the Linux kernel has several places where stack memory is leaked due to incomplete initialization of buffers/structures before copying them to userspace.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
      "Insufficient Initialization"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can potentially obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory by examining the leaked data.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation through crafted netlink messages to the DCB interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to interact with netlink interfaces."
  },
  "CVE-2013-2635": {
    "Description": "A kernel stack information leak was discovered in the RTNETLINK component of the Linux kernel. A local user could read sensitive information from the kernel stack.",
     "Root cause": "The `rtnl_fill_ifinfo` function in `net/core/rtnetlink.c` of the Linux kernel does not fully initialize a structure member, which leads to kernel stack memory being leaked.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
      "Insufficient Initialization"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can potentially read sensitive information from the kernel stack.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation via crafted netlink requests (RTM_GETLINK).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user able to send netlink messages."
