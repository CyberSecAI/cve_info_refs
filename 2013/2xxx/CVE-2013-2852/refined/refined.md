    "description": "A format string vulnerability exists in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver for the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges.",
    "root_cause": "The module parameter \"fwpostfix\" is userspace controllable, unfiltered, and is used to define the firmware filename. b43_do_request_fw() populates ctx->errors[] on error, containing the firmware filename. b43err() parses its arguments as a format string.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Format string vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users with uid 0 could gain elevated ring 0 privileges, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with administrative privileges. System crash.",
