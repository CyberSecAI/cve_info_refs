Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2013-2034:

**Root Cause:**

*   **SECURITY-63 / CVE-2013-2034:**  A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists due to insufficient protection against forged requests.
*   **SECURITY-69 / CVE-2013-2034:** Another CSRF vulnerability exists that allows attackers to trigger deployments to Maven repositories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF:** Both vulnerabilities stem from the lack of proper CSRF protection mechanisms within Jenkins. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in user (typically an administrator) into performing actions they did not intend.
*  **Imprecise Permission Check (Related to SECURITY-63):** The permission check related to the arbitrary code execution vulnerability is done imprecisely which can affect Jenkins instances with custom authorization strategy plugins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SECURITY-63:** Allows an anonymous attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master server. This can lead to full compromise of the Jenkins server and potentially the systems it manages.
*   **SECURITY-69:** Enables an attacker to deploy malicious binaries to Maven repositories. This can compromise the software supply chain and introduce vulnerabilities into downstream systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF Attack:**  The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that, when opened by an authenticated Jenkins user (typically an administrator), triggers the vulnerable actions.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the administrator into clicking the malicious URL. This could be done through phishing emails or other social engineering tactics.
*   **For SECURITY-69:** The attacker needs knowledge of the target Jenkins URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Anonymous (SECURITY-63):** The attacker does not need a valid account on the Jenkins server.
*   **Knowledge of Jenkins URL (Both):** For both SECURITY-63 and SECURITY-69 the attacker needs to know the URL of the target Jenkins instance.
*   **Ability to Trick User:** The attacker needs to trick a Jenkins administrator into opening a malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory explicitly mentions that SECURITY-63 is considered critical due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   SECURITY-69 is rated high because it can be exploited by external attackers and allow impersonation and unauthorized access to information, especially impacting instances behind a firewall.
*   The advisory also mentions that the attack is passive.
*   The document lists the fixed versions for different Jenkins release lines.
