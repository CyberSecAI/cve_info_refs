- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `content_preset.php` script in e107 CMS does not properly sanitize user input when processing GET parameters, specifically when the input contains "%00" in conjunction with "%0d%0a".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary script code, potentially leading to the theft of authentication data or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a GET parameter containing the specific payload (`%00` and `%0d%0a` along with script code), an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability when a user clicks on the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and convince a victim to access it.
