- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IOServer DNP3 driver software does not properly validate input on TCP port 20000, which can affect the control flow or data flow of a program. This improper validation allows an attacker to craft unexpected input, leading to unintended behavior.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The software fails to validate or incorrectly validates input, allowing for the injection of malicious data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can send a specially crafted TCP packet to the outstation, causing it to enter an infinite loop. The device must be manually shut down and restarted to recover.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via TCP port 20000.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A moderately skilled attacker is required to craft the malicious TCP packets. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
