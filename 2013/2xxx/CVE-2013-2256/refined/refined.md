  "CVE-2013-2256": {
    "Description": "A resource limit circumvention vulnerability exists in Nova's handling of private flavors. Any tenant is able to show and boot any other tenant's private flavors by guessing a flavor ID. This not only exposes the flavor's name, memory and disk size, swap allocation, VCPU count and similar flavor properties, but potentially allows circumvention of any resource limits enforced through the os-flavor-access:is_public property.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control enforcement when retrieving and using private flavors. The `is_public` flag was only enforced during flavor listing, but not during flavor retrieval or instance booting.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control",
       "Insufficient validation of user permissions"
    ],
    "Impact": "Circumvention of resource limits, exposure of private flavor details, and unauthorized instance booting.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker (tenant) can exploit the vulnerability by guessing another tenant's private flavor ID and then using it to view flavor details or boot an instance.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker requires a valid tenant account and the ability to send API requests to the OpenStack service. They need to know or guess the flavor ID.",
     "Additional details": "The vulnerability was present in OpenStack Nova versions prior to the fixes. The issue was that the is_public flag was only being enforced when listing flavors, not when requesting details or booting. Backports were required for Folsom and Grizzly."
