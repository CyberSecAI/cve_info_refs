# [OSSA 2013-019] Resource limit circumvention in Nova private flavors (CVE-2013-2256)

---

*From*: Jeremy Stanley <jeremy () openstack org>

*Date*: Tue, 6 Aug 2013 15:04:15 +0000

---

```
OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-019
CVE: CVE-2013-2256
Date: August 6, 2013
Title: Resource limit circumvention in Nova private flavors
Reporter: hzrandd (NetEase)
Products: Nova
Affects: All versions

Description:
hzrandd from NetEase reported a resource limit circumvention
vulnerability in Nova's handling of private flavors. Any tenant is
able to show and boot any other tenant's private flavors by guessing
a flavor ID. This not only exposes the flavor's name, memory and
disk size, swap allocation, VCPU count and similar flavor
properties, but potentially allows circumvention of any resource
limits enforced through the os-flavor-access:is_public property.

Havana (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/34963>

Grizzly fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/37992>

Folsom fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/38318>

Notes:
This fix is included in the havana-2 development milestone and will
appear in a future 2013.1.3 release.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1199)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix multiple security issues and
various bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (Nova), which
provides services for provisioning, managing, and using virtual machine
instances.

It was found that the fixes for CVE-2013-1664 and CVE-2013-1665, released
via RHSA-2013:0657, did not fully correct the issues in the Extensible
Markup Language (XML) parser used by Nova. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to a Nova API, causing
Nova to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory, or possibly crash.
(CVE-2013-4179)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Nova handled network source
security group policy updates. An authenticated user could send a large
number of server creation operations, causing nova-network to become
unresponsive. (CVE-2013-4185)

An information disclosure flaw and a resource limit bypass were found in
the way Nova handled virtual hardware templates (flavors). These allowed
tenants to show and boot other tenants' flavors and bypass resource limits
enforced via the os-flavor-access:is\_public property. (CVE-2013-2256)

It was discovered that, in some configurations, certain messages in
console-log could cause nova-compute to become unresponsive, resulting in a
denial of service. (CVE-2013-4261)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
CVE-2013-2256 and CVE-2013-4185. Upstream acknowledges hzrandd from NetEase
as the original reporter of CVE-2013-2256, and Vishvananda Ishaya
from Nebula as the original reporter of CVE-2013-4185. Upstream also
acknowledges Ken'ichi Ohmichi from NEC for providing a corrected fix for
CVE-2013-2256.

The CVE-2013-4179 issue was discovered by Grant Murphy of the Red Hat
Product Security Team, and CVE-2013-4261 was discovered by Jaroslav Henner
of Red Hat.

This update also fixes a number of bugs in openstack-nova.

Additionally, openstack-nova has been rebased to the latest stable release
2013.1.3. (BZ#993100)

All users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the running Nova services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

### Bug Description

i want to display the bug as follows:

make sure the role is admin: source devstack/openrc admin admin

i create a private flavor as follows：

nova flavor-create test1 7 512 4 2

make sure the role is demo: source devstack/openrc demo demo

ok,now i use 'nova flavor-list'

+----+-----------+-----------+------+-----------+------+-------+-------------+-----------+---------------------------+

| ID | Name | Memory\_MB | Disk | Ephemeral | Swap | VCPUs | RXTX\_Factor | Is\_Public | extra\_specs |

+----+-----------+-----------+------+-----------+------+-------+-------------+-----------+---------------------------+

but,when i use 'nova flavor-show' :

nova flavor-show 7

| os-flavor-access:is\_public | False |

| ram | 512 |

| rxtx\_factor | 1.0 |

| swap | |

| vcpus | 2 |

+----------------------------+-------+

so,the demo can boot a new instance with the private flavor.i want to prevent other tenants accessing my private flavor, such as the command: nova flavor-show , only on this way can we prevent the other tenants use my private flavors to create instance.

ok,i modfiy the codes in 'nova/api/openstack/compute/flavors.py' to fix this bug.

def show(self, req, id):

    """Return data about the given flavor id."""

    try:

context = req.environ['nova.context']

     flavor = instance\_types.get\_instance\_type\_by\_flavor\_id(id, context)

if not context.is\_admin:

         flavors = self.\_get\_flavors(req)

         flavor\_is\_not = False

        for k in flavors:

            if k.get('flavorid', None) != flavor.get('flavorid', None)\

                               and flavor.get('is\_public', None) == False:

                flavor\_is\_not = True

        if flavor\_is\_not:

            raise webob.exc.HTTPNotFound()

    req.cache\_db\_flavor(flavor)

    except exception.NotFound:

        raise webob.exc.HTTPNotFound()

return self.\_view\_builder.show(req, flavor)

I created a non-public flavor as an admin:

I switched to the regular user and could still see the flavor and start an instance with it. It was not included in "nova flavor-list".

I don't think flavor descriptions is a critical info leak (unless I'm missing something), but I agree we should probably issue an OSSA about this. Other thoughts ?

I think the problem is a little worse than described. It's not just about being able to see the flavor details. The ability to boot it is significant here. It means you're able to boot an instance with a set of resources you were not supposed to have access to. This could result in your instance ending up on hardware you weren't supposed to have access to, as one example. That's a bigger problem than the fact that you can see flavor details to me.

Make flavors is\_public option actually work

When you create a flavor, you can set an is\_public flag to be True or

    False. It is True by default. When False, the intention is that the

    flavor is only accessible by an admin, unless you use the flavor\_access

    API extension to grant access to specific tenants.

Unfortunately, the only place in the code where this was being enforced

    was when listing flavors through the API. It would filter out the

    non-public ones for a non-admin. Otherwise, the flavor was accessible.

    You could get the details, and you could boot an instance with it, if

    you figured out a valid flavor ID.

This patch adds enforcement down in the db layer. It also fixes one

    place in the API where the context wasn't passed down to enable the

    enforcement to happen.

Fix [bug 1194093](/bugs/1194093).

Fix bug 1194093.

I tried to backport the patch to Essex, and it's far from trivial. Is the Canonical security team working on it?

Hi,

I feel we need to fix this problem for "create an instance" API.

I have reported the other bug ticket(#1212179) and proposed the code(<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/41875/>) because this ticket is "Fix Released".

### Bug Description

i want to display the bug as follows:

make sure the role is admin: source devstack/openrc admin admin

i create a private flavor as follows：

nova flavor-create test1 7 512 4 2

make sure the role is demo: source devstack/openrc demo demo

ok,now i use 'nova flavor-list'

+----+-----------+-----------+------+-----------+------+-------+-------------+-----------+---------------------------+

| ID | Name | Memory\_MB | Disk | Ephemeral | Swap | VCPUs | RXTX\_Factor | Is\_Public | extra\_specs |

+----+-----------+-----------+------+-----------+------+-------+-------------+-----------+---------------------------+

but,when i use 'nova flavor-show' :

nova flavor-show 7

| os-flavor-access:is\_public | False |

| ram | 512 |

| rxtx\_factor | 1.0 |

| swap | |

| vcpus | 2 |

+----------------------------+-------+

so,the demo can boot a new instance with the private flavor.i want to prevent other tenants accessing my private flavor, such as the command: nova flavor-show , only on this way can we prevent the other tenants use my private flavors to create instance.

ok,i modfiy the codes in 'nova/api/openstack/compute/flavors.py' to fix this bug.

def show(self, req, id):

    """Return data about the given flavor id."""

    try:

context = req.environ['nova.context']

     flavor = instance\_types.get\_instance\_type\_by\_flavor\_id(id, context)

if not context.is\_admin:

         flavors = self.\_get\_flavors(req)

         flavor\_is\_not = False

        for k in flavors:

            if k.get('flavorid', None) != flavor.get('flavorid', None)\

                               and flavor.get('is\_public', None) == False:

                flavor\_is\_not = True

        if flavor\_is\_not:

            raise webob.exc.HTTPNotFound()

    req.cache\_db\_flavor(flavor)

    except exception.NotFound:

        raise webob.exc.HTTPNotFound()

return self.\_view\_builder.show(req, flavor)

I just reproduced this.

I created a non-public flavor as an admin:

$ . openrc admin

    $ nova flavor-create test2 8 512 4 2 --is-public False

I switched to the regular user and could still see the flavor and start an instance with it. It was not included in "nova flavor-list".

I don't think flavor descriptions is a critical info leak (unless I'm missing something), but I agree we should probably issue an OSSA about this. Other thoughts ?

I think the problem is a little worse than described. It's not just about being able to see the flavor details. The ability to boot it is significant here. It means you're able to boot an instance with a set of resources you were not supposed to have access to. This could result in your instance ending up on hardware you weren't supposed to have access to, as one example. That's a bigger problem than the fact that you can see flavor details to me.

Make flavors is\_public option actually work

When you create a flavor, you can set an is\_public flag to be True or

    False. It is True by default. When False, the intention is that the

    flavor is only accessible by an admin, unless you use the flavor\_access

    API extension to grant access to specific tenants.

Unfortunately, the only place in the code where this was being enforced

    was when listing flavors through the API. It would filter out the

    non-public ones for a non-admin. Otherwise, the flavor was accessible.

    You could get the details, and you could boot an instance with it, if

    you figured out a valid flavor ID.

This patch adds enforcement down in the db layer. It also fixes one

    place in the API where the context wasn't passed down to enable the

    enforcement to happen.

Fix [bug 1194093](/bugs/1194093).

Hi,

I feel we need to fix this problem for "create an instance" API.

I have reported the other bug ticket(#1212179) and proposed the code(<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/41875/>) because this ticket is "Fix Released".

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-08-05 20:14:39 UTC  ``` Jeremey Stanley (jeremy) reports:  Title: Resource limit circumvention in Nova private flavors Reporter: hzrandd (NetEase) Products: Nova Affects: All versions  hzrandd from NetEase reported a resource limit circumvention vulnerability in Nova's handling of private flavors. Any tenant is able to show and boot any other tenant's private flavors by guessing a flavor ID. This not only exposes the flavor's name, memory and disk size, swap allocation, VCPU count and similar flavor properties, but potentially allows circumvention of any resource limits enforced through the os-flavor-access:is_public property.  Havana (development branch) fix: <https://review.openstack.org/34963>  Grizzly fix: <https://review.openstack.org/37992>  Folsom fix: <https://review.openstack.org/38318>  Notes: This fix is included in the 2013.2.b2 development milestone and will appear in a future 2013.1.3 release.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-06 20:33:53 UTC  ``` This is now public:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q3/281>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2013-08-08 03:56:22 UTC  ```  Created openstack-nova tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 994809](show_bug.cgi?id=994809 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2256 openstack-nova: OpenStack: Nova private flavors resource limit circumvention [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 994810](show_bug.cgi?id=994810 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-2256 openstack-nova: OpenStack: Nova private flavors resource limit circumvention [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-21 20:36:10 UTC  ``` The previous fix was insufficient and did not fully fix the flaw, as noted here:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/+bug/1212179](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/%2Bbug/1212179)  The patch to fully correct this flaw is here (I believe it would be in addition to previously-mentioned patches):  <https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/4054cc4a22a1fea997dec76afb5646fd6c6ea6b9>  This will require a second CVE for the incomplete fix; I've asked upstream to bring this up on the oss-security list.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2013-08-22 15:56:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c5)) > The previous fix was insufficient and did not fully fix the flaw, as noted > here: >  > [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/+bug/1212179](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/%2Bbug/1212179) >  > The patch to fully correct this flaw is here (I believe it would be in > addition to previously-mentioned patches): >  > <https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/> > 4054cc4a22a1fea997dec76afb5646fd6c6ea6b9 >  > This will require a second CVE for the incomplete fix; I've asked upstream > to bring this up on the oss-security list.
