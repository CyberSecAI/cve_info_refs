{
  "CVE-2013-2892": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the Linux kernel's Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem, specifically within the pantherlord/GreenAsia game controller driver (CONFIG_HID_PANTHERLORD). This occurs when the driver receives a malicious output report from an HID device.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user with physical access to the system could exploit this flaw to cause a kernel crash (Denial of Service) or potentially achieve privilege escalation by executing arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Physical access to the system is required to connect a malicious HID device.",
          "The attacker must send a specially crafted malicious output report through the HID device."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Physical access to the target system",
      "Ability to craft and send malicious output reports through a HID device."
    ]
  }
}
