Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2617:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `curl` Ruby gem constructs shell commands. It directly interpolates user-provided URLs into the command string, without proper sanitization or escaping. Specifically, the vulnerable code is in `lib/curl.rb`:
```ruby
cmd = "curl #{cookies_store} #{browser_type} #{@setup_params} {ref}  \"{url}\"  "
result = open_pipe(cmd)
```

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is a command injection vulnerability. By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into the `curl` command that is executed by the system.
- **Unsafe String Interpolation:** The use of string interpolation (`"#{url}"`) without proper escaping of special characters allows the attacker to inject commands through the URL parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server where the vulnerable Ruby gem is used. This means the attacker can gain complete control over the system, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a specially crafted URL that includes shell command injection sequences. The gem then uses this URL directly in a command passed to the shell.
- **HTTP Request:**  A vulnerable application using the curl gem would make an http request, embedding the malicious URL. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to influence the URL:** The attacker needs the ability to influence the URL parameter that is processed by the vulnerable application. This is commonly achieved by exploiting vulnerable web applications.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to send the crafted request to the vulnerable system.
- **No authentication:** The exploit shown does not require authentication
