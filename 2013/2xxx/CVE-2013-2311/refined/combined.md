===== IMPORTANT SECURITY ALERT =====After upgrade you should run
    cp applications/welcome/static/js/share.js applications/<yourapp>/static/js/share.js
for any one of <yourapp>s using share.js for social bookmarking. The js contains a bug which may be exploited for xss. This is a minor xss issue and no malicious data reaches the web2py server but nevertheless I strongly suggest you fix it.
I sincerely thank JPCERT Coordination Center  for reporting this issue.
