- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MiCOM S1 Software does not restrict user access to its installed executables, allowing any user with access to the local system to replace them with malicious files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284). The software fails to limit access to its executable files to only authorized administrative users. This allows any user with local system access to modify or replace these files. Also, a Windows Service running under LocalSystem within the installation directory can be exploited for privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Loss of availability of the application, as malicious executables will run instead of the legitimate ones.
    - Loss of integrity, as the software's functionalities can be compromised through replaced executables.
    - Loss of confidentiality, as the attacker can gain unauthorized access and control over the system.
    - Disruption in communications with connected devices.
    - Privilege escalation from a lower privileged user to administrator by replacing the Windows Service executable.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local; the attacker must have some level of access to the local system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with any level of user access to the local system is required. High skill is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
