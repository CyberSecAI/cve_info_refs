Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an **improper input validation** in the GE CIMPLICITY WebView application. Specifically, the CimWebServer does not properly validate inputted information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation in the CimWebServer component of GE CIMPLICITY WebView. This allows attackers to send specially crafted packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can have several impacts:
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can crash the CIMPLICITY WebView or built-in web server.
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could run arbitrary commands on the server running the affected software.
    * **Server Control:** An attacker could potentially gain full control of the CIMPLICITY server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network connection.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attack does not require authentication, making it easier to exploit.
*   **Malicious TCP Messages:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending malicious messages over a TCP connection to the listening service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable software.
*   **Technical Skill:** The attacker requires medium technical skills to craft the malicious packets and exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable component (CIMPLICITY built-in Web server) is not enabled by default.
*   GE has released updates to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v2 base score of 8.8.
