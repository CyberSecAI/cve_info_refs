Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-2891:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `HID` (Human Interface Device) subsystem within the Linux kernel, specifically in the `steelseries` driver. This driver has a flaw in how it handles output reports.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is a heap-based buffer overflow where the driver attempts to zero out memory 16 bytes past the end of a heap allocation. This is a "past-end-of-heap-alloc zeroing" issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is a small write past the end of a heap buffer, which can lead to memory corruption. While the write is a zeroing, this could still have unintended consequences, potentially leading to system instability or other issues.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the processing of HID output reports by the `steelseries` driver. A malicious HID device or a compromised device driver could trigger this vulnerability by crafting a specific report.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control or influence HID output reports processed by the kernel. This could be achieved by using a malicious USB device pretending to be a steelseries device. The vulnerability requires that `CONFIG_HID_STEELSERIES` is enabled in the kernel configuration.
