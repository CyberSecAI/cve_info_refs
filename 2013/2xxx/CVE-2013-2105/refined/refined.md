Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of a temporary file ("/tmp/browser.html") within the "show\_in\_browser" Ruby gem. The gem opens this file, writes HTML content to it, and then opens it in a web browser. The issue arises because the gem does not create the file atomically and lacks proper locking mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition:** A malicious user can exploit the time between the creation of the temporary file and the gem's use of that file. The attacker can create the /tmp/browser.html file before the vulnerable gem does. While the vulnerable gem is executing, a malicious user can repeatedly write malicious HTML into the file, injecting arbitrary HTML content just before it is opened by the web browser. This happens because the `File.open()` command opens the file non-atomically, and then `file.write(html)` does not check if the file has been modified by any other process. This is a TOCTOU issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary HTML injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript, into the temporary file that is opened in the victim's browser.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The injected JavaScript code can be used to perform actions within the context of the victim's browser session, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File system manipulation:** An attacker must have write access to the `/tmp` directory or be able to manipulate the `/tmp/browser.html` file concurrently.
- **Concurrent access:** The attack relies on exploiting the race condition between when the gem opens the `/tmp/browser.html` and when the attacker writes to it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to write files to the file system where the vulnerable gem is running.
- **Concurrent execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute commands while the vulnerable gem is running in order to exploit the race condition.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the "FIX: N/A," indicating that a patch was not immediately available at the time of the report.
- The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) provided shows how a simple `while` loop can be used to repeatedly overwrite `/tmp/browser.html` with malicious HTML.
