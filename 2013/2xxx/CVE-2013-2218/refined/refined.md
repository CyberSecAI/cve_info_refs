{
  "CVE-2013-2218": {
    "Description": "The virConnectListAllInterfaces method has a double-free of the 'struct netcf_if' object when any of the filtering flags cause an interface to be skipped over. For example when running the command 'virsh iface-list --inactive'",
    "Root cause": "Double-free of the 'struct netcf_if' object.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Double-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Crash of libvirtd daemon, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Executing the `virsh iface-list` command with the `--inactive` flag or other filtering flags"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Non-root user with access to the `virsh` command or other libvirt client tools capable of triggering `virConnectListAllInterfaces` and setting filtering flags."
