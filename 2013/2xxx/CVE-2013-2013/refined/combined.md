Message-ID: <20130523205212.GE29720@openstack.org>
Date: Thu, 23 May 2013 20:52:12 +0000
From: Jeremy Stanley <jeremy@...nstack.org>

Subject: [OSSA 2013-013] Keystone client local information disclosure
 (CVE-2013-2013)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-013
CVE: CVE-2013-2013
Date: May 23, 2013
Title: Keystone client local information disclosure
Reporter: Jake Dahn (Nebula)
Products: python-keystoneclient
Affects: All versions

Description:
Jake Dahn from Nebula reported a vulnerability that the keystone
client only allows passwords to be updated in a clear text
command-line argument, which may enable other local users to obtain
sensitive information by listing the process and potentially leaves
a record of the password within the shell command history.

Fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/28702>

Notes:
A fix has already been merged to the python-keystoneclient master
branch on 2013-05-21 (commit f2e0818) which adds an interactive
password prompt, and will appear in the next release of
python-keystoneclient.

For the record, posted a patch for review.

For backward compatibility and support automated environment, retained current functionality. That said, with the new patch, user can either specify new password in command line, or enter using the prompt.

If no one else is working on this, I can take a look. Do we have to revive the old patch or, can i come up with some thing different.

Allow secure user password update.

This patch allows the ability for user password to be updated via

    a command prompt so the password doesnt show up in the bash history.

    The prompted password is asked twice to verify the match.

    If user cntl-D's the prompt a message appears suggesting user to use

    either of the options to update the password.

Proposed impact description...

Title: Keystone client local information disclosure

    Reporter: Jake Dahn (Nebula)

    Products: python-keystoneclient

    Affects: All versions

Description:

    Jake Dahn from Nebula reported a vulnerability that the keystone

    client only allows passwords to be updated in a clear text

    command-line argument, which may enable other local users to obtain

    sensitive information by listing the process and potentially leaves

    a record of the password within the shell command history.

For the record, posted a patch for review.

For backward compatibility and support automated environment, retained current functionality. That said, with the new patch, user can either specify new password in command line, or enter using the prompt.

Assigned a CVE for this as per <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/04/26/6>

While auditing OpenStack bugs for flaws needing CVE's I came across

this (as of yet unfixed) one:

[https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/+bug/938315](https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/%2Bbug/938315)

[root@...s ~]# keystone user-password-update --user=jake

usage: keystone user-password-update --pass <password> <user-id>

keystone user-password-update: error: too few arguments

This class of vuln typically gets a CVE.

CVE text:

OpenStack keystone places a username and password on the command line,

which allows local users to obtain credentials by listing the process.

Please use CVE-2013-2013 for this issue.

Could make sense to release a security advisory for this one when fixed. That would be our first for a client library/CLI...

If no one else is working on this, I can take a look. Do we have to revive the old patch or, can i come up with some thing different.

@Pradeep: you can definitely come up with something different. reading from the original proposal it wasn't exactly perfect or approved yet.

Allow secure user password update.

This patch allows the ability for user password to be updated via

    a command prompt so the password doesnt show up in the bash history.

    The prompted password is asked twice to verify the match.

    If user cntl-D's the prompt a message appears suggesting user to use

    either of the options to update the password.

Fixes: bug#938315

Proposed impact description...

Title: Keystone client local information disclosure

    Reporter: Jake Dahn (Nebula)

    Products: python-keystoneclient

    Affects: All versions

Description:

    Jake Dahn from Nebula reported a vulnerability that the keystone

    client only allows passwords to be updated in a clear text

    command-line argument, which may enable other local users to obtain

    sensitive information by listing the process and potentially leaves

    a record of the password within the shell command history.
