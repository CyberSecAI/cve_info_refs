Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `keystone` client allowed passwords to be updated via a command-line argument in clear text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Clear Text Password Exposure:** Passwords were being passed directly as command-line arguments, making them visible to anyone with access to the process list (e.g., via `ps` or similar commands).
- **Command History Exposure:** The cleartext password would be saved in the user's shell command history, potentially exposing it even after the command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Local users could obtain sensitive user passwords by inspecting the command-line arguments of running `keystone` processes or by accessing the shell history. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and associated cloud resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system where the `keystone` client is being used to update user passwords.
- **Process Inspection:** The attacker can then use standard system tools to view the command-line arguments of the `keystone` process.
- **Shell History Access:** An attacker could also gain access to the shell history files of the user who executed the password update command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system where the vulnerable `keystone` command is executed. They do not necessarily need elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Access to Process List/History:** The attacker needs the ability to list running processes and access shell history files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Jake Dahn from Nebula.
- The fix involves adding an interactive password prompt to the `keystone user-password-update` command, preventing the password from appearing in command-line arguments or shell history. The fix was committed on 2013-05-21 with commit ID f2e0818.
-  The fix was included in version 0.2.4 of python-keystoneclient.
- The fix retains the option to supply password via command line for backward compatibility and to support automated environments.
