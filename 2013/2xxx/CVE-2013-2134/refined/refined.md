Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two issues within Apache Struts 2:

1.  **Unescaped Action Names:** Struts 2 allows action mappings based on wildcards (e.g., `*`). When a request doesn't match a defined action, it's matched by the wildcard, and the requested action name is used to load a JSP file. The action name is not sanitized or validated against a whitelist, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary code.
2.  **Double OGNL Evaluation:** The `TextParseUtil.translateVariables` function performs a double evaluation of OGNL expressions when a combination of `$` and `%` characters is used. This allows for further code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OGNL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an OGNL injection, where untrusted user input is processed as an OGNL expression.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Failure to sanitize or whitelist the action names before processing them as OGNL expressions.
*   **Double Evaluation:** The double evaluation of OGNL expressions exacerbates the impact of OGNL injection by allowing for more complex code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary Java code on the server.
*   **Remote Server Context Manipulation:** This allows for modification of the server's environment.
*   **Malicious Client-Side Code Injection:** Injection of malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can inject OGNL expressions via crafted URLs.
*   **Wildcard Action Mapping:** Exploiting the wildcard action mapping feature.
*   **Double Evaluation:** Utilizing nested OGNL expressions with `$` and `%` characters to trigger the double evaluation weakness.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication:** Exploitation of the vulnerability does not require authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by introducing whitelisting of action names and removing the double evaluation of expressions in `OgnlTextParser`, used by `TextParseUtil.translateVariables`.
*   The affected versions include Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.3.14.2.
*   The solution is to upgrade to Struts 2.3.14.3 or later.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jon Passki from Coverity Security Research Laboratory.

The Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory for October 2013 and January 2014 also mention CVE-2013-2134 as being addressed in their patches for Oracle FLEXCUBE and WebCenter Sites, which also use Struts.
