Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for C++ (xml-security-c) handles the output length of HMAC-based XML Signatures. Specifically, the `DSIGAlgorithmHandlerDefault` class and its `compareBase64StringToRaw` and `verify` functions have insufficient validation for length values, which can lead to a denial-of-service or signature bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insufficient Length Validation:** The software does not properly check the length of the output when processing HMAC signatures. This missing validation is in `compareBase64StringToRaw`, the `DSIGAlgorithmHandlerDefault::verify`, and `DSIGAlgorithmHandlerDefault` functions.
2.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted input with a manipulated output length can cause a denial-of-service. The specific mechanism is not detailed beyond "specially chosen input."
3.  **Signature Spoofing:** In unusual cases, the insufficient validation of the output length in the functions mentioned above can allow an attacker to bypass the protection implemented for CVE-2009-0217. This bypass could lead to improper verification of a signature, effectively allowing signature spoofing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by providing specially crafted XML data with specific output lengths, making the system processing the data unavailable.
*   **Signature Spoofing/Bypass:** By bypassing the checks for CVE-2009-0217, an attacker can potentially forge signatures, leading to an attacker being able to impersonate a legitimate signer. This could result in unauthorized access or data manipulation if the system relies on verifying the origin and integrity of XML documents with digital signatures.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the network, by sending malformed XML documents to an affected system. This can be done without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any special authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker must be able to send specially crafted XML data to the affected application or system.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed by adding a check to ensure the `maxCompare` value is not negative in the `compareBase64StringToRaw` function, and ensuring that the output length is greater than the hash length when checking the output length of HMAC signatures.
*   Patches are available in the linked subversion revision: [http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1493960](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1493960)
