Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-2478:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the MS-MMS dissector of Wireshark. A malformed packet processed by this dissector can trigger a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The primary vulnerability is a crash condition in the MS-MMS dissector when processing specially crafted packets. Specifically, there seems to be an issue with how the dissector handles the formatting of text, leading to the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash. This can be achieved either by injecting a malformed packet onto a network being captured by Wireshark, or by providing a malformed trace file to Wireshark to analyze.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed MS-MMS packet into a network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker could provide a specially crafted packet capture file containing a malformed MS-MMS packet to a Wireshark user, causing the application to crash when the user opens it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to either inject network packets into a monitored network or be able to provide a malicious capture file to a user of Wireshark. This could involve being on the same network or using social engineering to deliver the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.8.0 to 1.8.5 and 1.6.0 to 1.6.13.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Wireshark versions 1.8.6 and 1.6.14.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Laurent Butti.
- The bug report indicates that the fix involved removing "format_text" from the MS-MMS dissector.
