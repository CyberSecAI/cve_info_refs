Fix an XSS vulnerability in the reviews dropdown.

```
The reviews dropdown had a bad vulnerability where it would assume the
user's full name is valid HTML. This allowed the user to craft a script
tag that would be executed every time the name appeared in the dropdown.

This vulnerability exists in 1.6.x, 1.7.x, and the in-development 1.8.
There are no known attacks in the wild.

This was reported by Craig Young at Tripwire.

# [Review Board 1.6.17 and 1.7.10 released](/news/2013/06/22/review-board-1617-and-1710-released/)

## June 22, 2013

We have a pair of releases today for users of Review Board 1.6.x and 1.7.x. Both contain important security updates, and we recommend updating immediately.

This security vulnerability allows attackers to execute JavaScript under certain conditions. There are no known vulnerabilities in the wild. The latest 1.6.x and 1.7.x releases are susceptible to the flaw. We have released 1.6.x and 1.7.x updates. We recommend that all users upgrade their install to a modern release, particularly if you are running a version prior to 1.6.

Along with the security updates, Review Board 1.7.10 provides some new bug fixes, API enhancements (for comments and screenshots), and UI refinement.

See the [1.6.17](http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/reviewboard/1.6.17/) and [1.7.10](http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/reviewboard/1.7.10/) releases for more info.

Keep up with the latest Review Board releases, security updates, and
helpful information.

# Review Board 1.7.10 Release Notes[¶](#review-board-1-7-10-release-notes "Permalink to this heading")

**Release date**: June 22, 2013

## Security Updates[¶](#security-updates "Permalink to this heading")

Fixed an XSS vulnerability where users could trigger script errors under
certain conditions in auto-complete widgets.

There are no known vulnerabilities in the wild, but we recommend
upgrading immediately.

Thanks to Craig Young at Tripwire for reporting this to us.

## Web API Changes[¶](#web-api-changes "Permalink to this heading")

* Added n `?order-by=<fieldname>` query parameter for comment resources,
  allowing ordering by fields such as line numbers (for diff comments).
* Added a `filename` field to screenshot resources, which provides
  the base filename (without path) of the screenshot.
* Added a `review_url` field to screenshot resources, which provides
  the URL to the screenshot review page.
* Added a `thumbnail_url` field to screenshot comment resources,
  which provides the URL to the snippet of the screenshot being commented
  on.
* Added a `link_text` field to file attachment comment resources,
  which shows the text for any link pointing to the file. This may
  differ depending on the comment.
* Added a `review_url` field to file attachment comment resources,
  which provides the URL to the review page for the file.
* Added a `thumbnail_html` field to file attachment comment resources,
  which provides HTML for rendering the thumbnail of the portion of the
  file being rendered, if any.

## UI Changes[¶](#ui-changes "Permalink to this heading")

* Improved the look and feel of the issue summary table. It’s cleaner
  and no longer looks odd with long comment text.

## Bug Fixes[¶](#bug-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed periodic but harmless JavaScript errors when removing elements
  with relative timestamps.
* Editing or reordering dashboard columns no longer breaks after the
  dashboard reloads.
* Relative timestamps in the dashboard no longer break after the dashboard
  reloads.
* The maximum size of the timezone has increased, allowing for longer
  timezone strings. Patch by Nicolas Dély. ([Bug #3005](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/3005))

## Contributors[¶](#contributors "Permalink to this heading")

* Christian Hammond
* Nicolas Dély
* David Trowbridge
