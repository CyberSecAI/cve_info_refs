Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2211:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `libxl` toolstack library of Xen. It does not properly set permissions on xenstore keys related to paravirtualized and emulated serial console devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate Permissions:** The `libxl` library fails to enforce proper access control on xenstore keys for console devices. This allows guest administrators to write to keys that should only be modified by the host.
- **Implicit Trust:** The host implicitly trusts the values in these xenstore keys, making it vulnerable to modification by malicious guests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** A malicious guest administrator can read and write any files in the host filesystem that are accessible to the user running the `xenconsole` client binary. This could be the user ID of a host administrator or a self-service mechanism.
- **Console Redirection:** An attacker with access to an HVM guest can redirect PV or serial consoles to various network resources (sockets, UDP), or other endpoints (pipes, fifos) on the host, according to the privileges of the qemu device model.
- **VNC Port Redirection:** A malicious guest can redirect the guest's VNC console port to another port on the host, potentially exposing other guests or firewalled services to attacks.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating xenstore keys, a guest can potentially escalate its privileges on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Guest Administrator:** The primary attack vector is a compromised or malicious guest administrator.
- **Access to HVM Guest:** Access to an HVM guest is required to exploit the vulnerability, particularly for the console and VNC redirection attacks.
- **libxl Usage:** Systems using `libxl` as part of the toolstack are vulnerable, including the `xl` toolstack (default since Xen 4.2) and optionally `libvirt` when it uses the xenlight backend.
- **Xenstore Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by writing to specific xenstore keys related to console devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest Administrator Privileges:** The attacker must have administrative privileges within a guest domain.
- **Vulnerable Xen Setup:** The host system must be running a vulnerable version of Xen and using `libxl`.
- **Knowledge of Xenstore:** The attacker needs to be familiar with xenstore and the structure of keys related to console devices.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is described as a "write access" vulnerability, meaning a malicious guest can overwrite values in xenstore that the host implicitly trusts.
- Patches are available to correct the permissions of the xenstore keys.
- A workaround for systems where patches are not yet applied involves pausing domains, manually correcting xenstore permissions, and then unpausing them.

In summary, CVE-2013-2211 allows a malicious guest administrator to gain control over a host by exploiting a flaw in how `libxl` manages xenstore permissions for console devices. This allows for privilege escalation, arbitrary file access, and redirection of console traffic.
