# Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013

## Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update and Security Alert. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update and Security Alert advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

 **Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 42 new security fixes across Java SE products of which 2 are applicable to server deployments of Java.

### Supported Products Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below.  Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PatchTable) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Affected product releases and versions:

| Java SE | Patch Availability |
| --- | --- |
| JDK and JRE 7 Update 17 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| JDK and JRE 6 Update 43 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 41 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| JavaFX 2.2.7 and earlier | [JavaFX](/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html) |

### Patch Availability Table and Risk Matrix

Java SE fixes in this Update are cumulative; the latest Critical Patch Update includes all fixes from the previous Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts.

#### Patch Availability Table

| Product Group | Risk Matrix | Patch Availability and Installation Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oracle Java SE | [Oracle JDK and JRE Risk Matrix](#AppendixJAVA) | * Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update April 2013 [My Oracle Support Note 1535424.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=442957590514109&id=1535424.1) * Developers can download the latest release from [http://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html.](/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) * Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://www.java.com/en/.](http://www.java.com/en/)  Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](//www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release. * The latest JavaFX release is included with the latest update of JDK and JRE 7. For JDK and JRE 6 users, the latest Java FX release is available from [http://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html](/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html) |

#### Risk Matrix Content

The risk matrix lists only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for [previous](/security-alerts/) security fixes can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Document, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply these fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Security advisories, please review [previous](/security-alerts/) advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer supported. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Credit Statement

The following people or organizations reported security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle: Adam Gowdiak of Security Explorations; Alexander Antukh of SEC Consult; Alin Rad Pop (binaryproof) via HP's Zero Day Initiative; an Anonymous researcher via Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure Program; Ben Murphy via HP's ZDI; Ben Murphy with Aware Mobile via HP's Zero Day Initiative; Chris Ries via iDefense; Hontvári Attila; James Forshaw (tyranid) via HP's Zero Day Initiative; Jeroen Frijters; Joshua J. Drake with Accuvant LABS via HP's Zero Day Initiative; Vitaliy Toropov via HP's Zero Day Initiative; Vitaliy Toropov via iDefense; and VUPEN Security via HP's Zero Day Initiative.

#### Security-In-Depth Contributors

Oracle provides recognition to people that have contributed to our Security-In-Depth program (see [FAQ](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html)). People are recognized for Security-In-Depth contributions if they provide information, observations or suggestions pertaining to security vulnerability issues that result in significant modification of Oracle code or documentation in future releases, but are not of such a critical nature that they are distributed in Critical Patch Updates.

In this Critical Patch Update Advisory, Oracle recognizes Christian Schneider; Deepak Bhole of Red Hat; Denis Gorchakov of Positive Technologies; Jeroen Frijters; Mark Baggett; Timothy McKenzie of United American Insurance Company; Tomas Hoger of Red Hat; and Will Dormann of CERT/CC for contributions to Oracle's Security-In-Depth program.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 42 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  39 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/javacpuapr2013verbose.html).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 release.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=442976140883786&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

Alert
# Oracle Has Released Multiple Updates for Java SE

Last RevisedOctober 19, 2016
Alert CodeTA13-107A

### Systems Affected

* JDK and JRE 7 Update 17 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 6 Update 43 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 41 and earlier
* JavaFX 2.2.7 and earlier

### Overview

Oracle has released a Critical Patch Update (CPU) for Java SE. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.

[Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpuapr2013-1928497.html) describes the update:

*A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update and Security Alert. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update and Security Alert advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes.*

Systems administrators are advised to pay additional attention to Oracle advisories due to the increasing volume of vulnerabilities being patched with each release.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or gain unauthorized access to your files or system.

### Solution

**Apply Updates**

[Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpuapr2013-1928497.html) includes the following information:

*Developers can download the latest release from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.*

*Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from http://java.com. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use automatic updates to get the latest release.*

*The latest JavaFX release is included with the latest update of JDK and JRE 7. For JDK and JRE 6 users, the latest Java FX release is available from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/*
