Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `lib/bookmarks.php` file of ownCloud. Specifically, the `findBookmarks` function does not properly sanitize or validate the `$sqlSortColumn` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation/sanitization of the `$sqlSortColumn` parameter before it is used in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This can lead to:
    *   Data theft: Accessing and extracting sensitive information from the database.
    *   Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    *   Complete compromise of the application by injecting code into the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `$sqlSortColumn` parameter in the `findBookmarks` function. The specific way to reach this function is not documented in provided content, but given the nature of the application, it's likely to be through an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ownCloud instance.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check to ensure that `$sqlSortColumn` is one of a predefined list of safe values: `'id', 'url', 'title', 'user_id', 'description', 'public', 'added', 'lastmodified','clickcount'`. If the parameter does not match one of these, the code now defaults to `$sqlSortColumn = 'bookmarks_sorting_recent';`.
*   The commit `582c3ed` in the owncloud-archive/bookmarks repository addresses this issue.
*   The security advisory `oC-SA-2013-019` specifically mentions that ownCloud before 5.0.6 and 4.5.11 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in `lib/bookmarks.php`.
*   The commit message also highlights the importance of input validation for `$sqlSortColumn`.
*   The provided diff shows that the original code did not have any input sanitization for `$sqlSortColumn`.

**In summary**, CVE-2013-2046 is a SQL injection vulnerability in the ownCloud bookmarks app that allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands due to the lack of validation of the `$sqlSortColumn` parameter.
