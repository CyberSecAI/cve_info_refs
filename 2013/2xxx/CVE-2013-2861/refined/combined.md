    unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2863

    Chromium before 27.0.1453.110 does not properly handle SSL
    sockets, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via unspecified
    vectors.

CVE-2013-2865

    Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Chromium before
    27.0.1453.110 allow attackers to cause a denial of service or
