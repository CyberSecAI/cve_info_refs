## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked

into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit

these to cause a denial of service via application crash, potentially

execute arbitrary code, or lead to information disclosure. ([CVE-2013-1741](/security/CVE-2013-1741),

[CVE-2013-2566](/security/CVE-2013-2566), [CVE-2013-5605](/security/CVE-2013-5605), [CVE-2013-5607](/security/CVE-2013-5607))

Or different known (as in: has a CVE Number) issue(s)?

If so, I suggest putting the specifics of this information into the changelog and description of this ticket instead of "..." or a reference to the empty ticket.

Did you not read the USN?

We don't add them to the changelog because the issues are not public when we build the package. Putting them in the changelog would require us to delay starting builds until after Mozilla have actually released, which would add a significant delay to our release. We use a placeholder bug report instead, and then link the USN from it after release

# Mozilla Network Security Service: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **201406-19**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Network
Security Service, the worst of which could lead to Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/nss** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.15.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.15.3** |

### Background

The Mozilla Network Security Service is a library implementing security
features like SSL v2/v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12,
S/MIME and X.509 certificates.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Mozilla Network
Security Service. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
more details about the vulnerabilities.

### Impact

A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Network Security Service users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nss-3.15.3"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.

# Matthew Green

I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University. I've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks, payment systems and digital content protection platforms. In my research I look at the various ways cryptography can be used to promote user privacy.

# Attack of the week: RC4 is kind of broken inÂ TLS

[![](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/f225a-rc4.png?w=190&h=200)](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/f225a-rc4.png)

***Update:** Iâve addedÂ a link to a [page at Royal Holloway](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls) describing the new attack.*

Listen, if youâre using RC4 as your primary ciphersuite in [SSL/TLS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), now would be a great time to stop. Ok, thanks, are we all on the same page?

No?

I guess we need to talk about this a bit more. You see, [these slides](http://cr.yp.to/talks/2013.03.12/slides.pdf) have been making the rounds since this morning. Unfortunately, they contain a long presentation aimed at cryptographers, and nobody much seems to understand the *real*Â result thatâs buried around slide 306 (!). Iâd like to help.

Hereâs the short summary:

According to [AlFardan, Bernstein, Paterson, Poettering and Schuldt](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls)Â (a team fromÂ Royal Holloway, Eindhoven and UIC) the RC4 ciphersuite used in SSL/TLS is broken. If you choose to use it â as do a ridiculous number of major sites, including Google â then it may be possible for a dedicated attacker to recover your authentication cookies. The current attack is just on the edge of feasibility, and could probably be improved for specific applications.

This is bad and needs to change soon.

In the rest of this post Iâll cover the details in the usual âfunâ question-and-answer format I save for these kinds of attacks.
### **What is RC4 and why should I care?**

[RC4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4)Â is a fast [stream cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher) invented in 1987 by Ron Rivest. If you like details, you can seeÂ [this old post of mine](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2011/12/whats-deal-with-rc4.html) for a longwinded discussion of RC4âs history and flaws. Or you can take my word: RC4 is old and crummy.

Despite its age and crumminess, RC4 has become an extremely popular ciphersuite for SSL/TLS connections â to the point where it accounts for something absurd likeÂ *half*Â of all TLS traffic. There are essentially two reasons for this:

1. RC4 does not require padding or IVs, which means itâs immune to recent TLS attacks like [BEAST](http://www.net-security.org/article.php?id=1638) and [Lucky13](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/02/attack-of-week-tls-timing-oracles.html). Many admins have recommended it as the solution to these threats.
2. RC4 is pretty fast. Faster encryption means less computation and therefore lower hardware requirements for big service providers like Google.
### So whatâs wrong with RC4?

Like all stream ciphers, RC4 takes a short (*e.g.,*Â 128-bit) key and stretches it into a long string of [pseudo-random](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness) bytes. These bytes are XORed with the message you want to encrypt, resulting in what *should*Â be a pretty opaque (and random-looking) ciphertext.

The problem with RC4 is that the above statement is not quite true. The bytes come out of the RC4 arenât quite random looking â they have smallÂ *biases*. A few of these biases have been known for years, but werenât considered useful. However, [recent academic work](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-19574-7_5)Â has uncovered many small but significant additional biases running throughout the first 256 bytes of RC4 output. This new work has systematically identified *many*Â more.

At first blush this doesnât seem like a big deal. Cryptographically, however, itâs a disaster. If I encrypt the same message (plaintext) with many different RC4 keys, then I *should*Â get a bunch of totally random looking ciphertexts. But these tiny biases mean that they wonât be random â a statistical analysis of different positions of the ciphertext will show that some values occur more often.

By getting many different encryptions of the same message â under different keys â I can tally up these small deviations from random and thus figure out what was encrypted.

If you like analogies, think of it like peeking at a picture with your hands over your eyes. By peeking through your fingers you might only see a tiny sliver of the scene youâre looking at. But by repeating the observation many times, you may be able to combining those slivers and figure out what youâre looking at.

### **Why would someone encrypt the same message many times?**

The problem here (as usual) is your browser.

You see, there are certain common elements that your browser tends to send at the beginning of every [HTTP(S)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure)Â connection. One of these values is a *[cookie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie)*Â â typically a fixed string that identifies you to a website. These cookies are what let you log into Gmail without typing your password every time.

If you use HTTPS (which is enforced in many sites by default), then your cookies *should* be safe. After all, theyâll always be sent over an encrypted connection to the website.Unfortunately, if your connection is encrypted using RC4 (as is the case with Gmail), then each time you make a fresh connection to the Gmail site, youâre sending a new encrypted copy of the same cookie. If the session is renegotiated (*i.e.,*Â uses a different key) between those connections, then the attacker can build up the list of ciphertexts he needs.

To make this happen quickly, an attacker can send you a piece of Javascript that your browser will run â possibly on a non-HTTPS tab. This Javascript can then send many HTTPS requests to Google, ensuring that an eavesdropper will quickly build up thousands (or millions) of requests to analyze.

| Probability of recovering a plaintext byte (y axis) at a particular byte position in the RC4-encrypted stream (x axis), assuming 2^24 ciphertexts. Increasing the number of ciphertexts to 2^32 gives almost guaranteed plaintext recovery at all positions. ([source](http://cr.yp.to/talks/2013.03.12/slides.pdf)) |

### **Millions of ciphertexts? Pah. This is just crypto-wankery.**

Itâs true that the current attack requires an enormous number of TLS connections â in the tens to hundreds of millions â which means that itâs not likely to bother you. Today. On the other hand, this is the naive version of the attack, without any special optimizations.

For example, the results given by Bernstein assume no prior plaintext knowledge. But in practice we often know a lot about the structure of an interesting plaintext like a session cookie. For one thing, theyâre typically Base64 encoded â reducing the number of possibilities for each byte â and they may have some recognizable structure which can be teased out using advanced techniques.

Itâs not clear what impact these specific optimizations will have, but it tends to reinforce the old maxim: attacks only get better, they never get worse. And they can get *a lot*Â better while youâre arguing about them.

### **So what do we do about it?**

Treat this as a wakeup call. Sites (like Google) need to *stop using RC4*Â âÂ beforeÂ these attacks become practical. History tells us that [nation-state attackers](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9219731/Hackers_spied_on_300_000_Iranians_using_fake_Google_certificate) are already motivated to penetrate Gmail connections. The longer we stick with RC4, the more chances weâre giving them.

In the short term we have an ugly choice: stick with RC4 and hope for the best, or move back to CBC mode ciphersuites â which many sites have avoided due to the BEAST and Lucky13 attacks.

We could probably cover ourselves a bit by changing the operation of browsers, so as to detect and block Javascript that seems clearly designed to exercise these attacks. We could also put tighter limits on the duration and lifespan of session cookies. In theory we could also drop the first few hundred bytes of each RC4 connection â something thatâs a bit of a hack, and difficult to do without breaking the TLS spec.

In the longer term, we need to move towards authenticated encryption modes like the [new AEAD TLS ciphersuites](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5288), whichÂ should put an end to most of these problems. The problem is that weâll need browsers to support these modes too, and that could take ages.

### **In summary**

I once made fun of Threatpost for [sounding alarmist](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/ssl-vulnerabilities-found-critical-non-browser-software-packages-102512) about SSL/TLS. After all, itâs not like we really have an alternative. But the truth is that TLS (in its design, deployment and implementation) needs some active help. Weâre seeing too many attacks, and theyâre far too close to practical. Something needs to give.

We live in a world where NIST is happy to give us a new [hash function every few years](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/index.html). Maybe itâs time we put this level of effort and funding into the protocols that *use*Â these primitives? They certainly seem to need it.

   Why not just patch RC4 by discarding the first 256 bytes of the keystream?

   Or better yet, the first few thousand. The problem here is that you need to make this change on every client /and/ every server. And that means a fundamental change to the TLS spec (or some nasty, nasty hack).

   Yikes. And here I was about to recommend going RC4 only due to BEAST.

   What would the world look like if, one day, we woke up and TLS was completely brokenâ¦? Actually quite a scary thought without something else to go to.

   We do seem to need a new protocol â SSL/TLS only seems to be hanging on by its fingertips. Do you know of any alternatives in development out there?

   Both TLS 1.1/1.2 supposedly account for BEAST, and let us switch to a different cipher.

    Crap, and of course SMTP client authentication is most commonly done with SMTP AUTH PLAIN over TLS. So the AUTH PLAIN sends one unchanging base64-encoded string as the authenticator, with the only preceding text from the client being an EHLO line that doesn't change much (in practice).

    So it's worse than in HTTPS.

    The problem is not really TLS, it's the cypher (RC4) what's failing us here. A new cypher algorithm would help us fix this.

    SSL and TLS support zero length records which can be inserted randomly, moving the cipher state forward by at least the number of bytes in the MAC. This is within spec but breaks certain old implementations. AES-GCM is slow compared to even AES-SHA without HW acceleration. While it would be nice if TLS could hide whatever it transports, this specific issue like the last few, are more about the session cookie in HTTPS or SMTP hello.

    The problems with that:

    1) You would need to change all the clients, and if you do that, why not just upgrade to TLS 1.2 instead

    2) You increase the setup time for rc4, making it take longer to the point that its performance advantage either disappears completely, or becomes even slower than more secure alternatives.

    RC4 was amazing. There is no way that a stream cipher invented in the late 80s and published in the mid 90s should still be as strong as it is today, but there are better alternatives now and we should be using them.

    The problem is rooted to TLS. If encrypt-then-mac was used, there would not be BEAST, Lucky 13 attacks, and RC4 could have been easily replaced.

    The weakness of the first bytes of the RC4 stream has been known for years, if I'm not mistaken it's the way WEP was broken. Is this the same vulnerability or a different one? It seems to me that if it's the same, then the obvious fix would be to discard the first N bytes of the stream.

    No, actually the key scheduling was the main issue. The same key was used too often and in a predictable manner (concatenation of secret and a counter).

    âTreat this as a wakeup call. Sites (like Google) need to stop using RC4 â before these attacks become practical.â

    The reason major sites do this is that best practice currently states that you should prioritize RC4, e.g. see:

    The problem is the broken nature (due to BEAST) of block ciphers in SSL3 and TLS1.0. Until major browsers start supporting something better that TLS1.0 we are stuck with RC4. My reading of your article suggests that no one has made this a practical attack â whereas attacks against the block ciphers ARE practical TODAY.

    Its not the major sites that need to changeâ¦its the browser makers.

    But it would be considerably harder to implement an attack. The point of attacking HTTPS is the scenario where the attacker can run JavaScript in any unrelated browser tab.

    Isn't AES CTR mode supported in TLS?

    Sine it doesn't seem practical (or possible at all) to perform BEAST or Lycky13 kind of attacks in SMTP connection then why bother with RC4 that would gradually leak AUTH out to passive eavesdropper? Who sane would recommend that? Just use regular AES-CBC until it's phased out in favour of GCM.

    There were no nice plots of probabilities earlier and it's not the way WEP was broken, but it \*was\* widely known that initial portion of keystream is biased.

    Firefox has a feature where you can disable all the RC4 type ciphers, to force websites that don't prioritize AES type ciphers (about:config), gmail is one of them. You can even disable the Triple-Des ciphers.

    But, fireox doesn't have TLS 1.1 OR 1.2. IE 10 defaults to TLS 1.2 with AES in gmail. You can also remove âweak ciphersâ in Opera browser as well. Google Chrome doesn't have this feature, and that is the biggest negative, since it is better on almost every other function compared to Firefox, IE, or Opera.

    I've seen Google Docs and Youtube with ECC certificates too. Google must be trying some new things, the certificate was issued âFriday, â8 âMarch â2013 3:28:01 a.m. and has a 256bit ECC public key

    Exactly, and I don't even think anyone is actually working on getting it done either.

    what do you guys think about the higher grades of RSA? 2048 4028 etc?

    I believe that RSA upgraded the recommendation to 512 in the true RC4 spec back in the 90's. The problem is that people implemented based on the ARC4 papers which didn't include that proviso.

    This is part of the reason that WEP has been so completely broken.

    It just doesn't really assist. Plaintext data recovery really works regardless of how much cash you skip. Sad for repeating this particular, but that's how it will.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-103

## Miscellaneous Network Security Services (NSS) vulnerabilities

Announced
November 15, 2013
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 25.0.1
* Firefox ESR 17.0.11
* Firefox ESR 24.1.1
* SeaMonkey 2.22.1
* Thunderbird 24.1.1
* Thunderbird ESR 17.0.11

### Description

Mozilla has updated the version of [Network Security
Services (NSS) library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Overview_of_NSS) used in Mozilla projects to NSS 3.15.3 with the
exception of ESR17-based releases, which have been updated to NSS 3.14.5. This
addresses several moderate to critical rated networking security issues.

Google developer **Andrew Tinits** reported a potentially
exploitable buffer overflow that was fixed in both NSS 3.15.3 and NSS
3.14.5.

* [Null
  Cipher buffer overflow](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=934016) ([CVE-2013-5605](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5605))

Mozilla developer **Camilo Viecco** discovered that if the
verifylog feature was used when validating certificates then certificates with
incompatible key usage constraints were not rejected. This did not directly
affect Firefox but might affect other software using the NSS library

* [CERT\_VerifyCert can SECSuccess for bad certificates](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910438) ([CVE-2013-5606](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5606))

Google security researcher **Tavis Ormandy** reported a runaway
memset in certificate parsing on 64-bit computers leading to a crash by
attempting to write 4Gb of nulls.

* [Integer truncation in certificate parsing](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=925100)
  ([CVE-2013-1741](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1741))

**Pascal Cuoq**, RedHat developer **Kamil Dudka**,
and Google developer **Wan-Teh Chang** found equivalent [Netscape
Portable Runtime (NSPR) library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSPR) code suffered the same integer
truncation.

* [Avoid unsigned integer wrapping in PL\_ArenaAllocate](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=927687) ([CVE-2013-5607](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5607))

NSS lowered the priority of RC4 in cipher suite advertisement so
that more secure ciphers instead of RC4 are likely to be chosen by the
server. This can help address the problem described by **Nadhem
AlFardan**, **Dan Bernstein**, **Kenny
Paterson**, **Bertram Poettering** and **Jacob
Schuldt** in their paper "[On the Security of RC4 in
TLS.](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/)"

* ["On the Security of RC4 in TLS" plaintext recovery attack](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=850478)

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the âMozilla
Application Suiteâ.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

The January 2018 Critical Patch Update provides fixes for certain Oracle products for the Spectre (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) Intel processor vulnerabilities. Please refer to this Advisory and the [Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre and Meltdown](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1) MOS note (Doc ID 2347948.1).

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 238 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [January 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2338411.1)

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in italics indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2018 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2325393.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2325393.1)

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 27 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware. 21 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2325393.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2325393.1).

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 21 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 18 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 276 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Products and Versions column. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below to access the documentation for those patches.

The list of affected product releases and versions that are in Premier Support or Extended Support, under the [Oracle Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/) is as follows:

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from http://java.com. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2136219.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2136219.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 13 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 9 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 253 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](http://java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use automatic updates to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users can download the latest release of Netbeans from [http://netbeans.org](http://netbeans.org/). Users running earlier versions of Netbeans can use automatic updates to get the latest patches.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2171485.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2171485.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 252 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187793594395974id=2310031.1).

Please note that on September 22, 2017, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2017-9805](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2017-9805.html). Customers of affected Oracle product(s) are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in this Security Alert as well as those contained in this Critical Patch update

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Affected Products and Versions column. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187476629848401id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187417703460164id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2017 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2296870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=188252365614599id=2296870.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187589508421666id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 22 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 20 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

#### Notes:

1. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
2. Applies to the Java SE Kerberos client.
3. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service.

Subject: Re: Security of RC4 in TLS
Hi Brian,
Thanks for getting back to us and for the positive feedback on the paper. Given very recent events, I think you may as well share the paper with your Mozilla security group. The ideas are very much now in the public domain, and anyone who has a good understanding of crypto can pretty much reverse-engineer everything from what's already out there.
As you say, you can't just switch off RC4 in Firefox right away. Something like 3%-5% of websites ONLY accept RC4 ciphersuites, for example.
The medium-term solution is for everyone to switch to TLS 1.2 and its AEAD ciphersuites (AES-GCM for example). In the very short term, there's various hacks you can get your browser to do if the server insists on using RC4 - adding random numbers of bytes to initial requests; fragmenting the first GET request into single byte TLS messages so that the "weak" RC4 bytes are mostly consumed in encrypting the MAC field; etc. However, this is a solution that at best is going to last a few weeks, as we expect the attacks to get better and eventually to be able to recover plaintext from anywhere in the session. Then you would need to start doing things like limiting the number of times any cookie can be sent before it is expired.
Happy to discuss all of this more with you and the Mozilla team.

As noted in HN, doing 1/1/1/.../n-11 record splitting at the start of the TLS connection will burn off the first 256 keystream bytes. The compat issues are likely to be similar to 1/n-1 record splitting, which isn't perfect, but hopefully 1/n-1 record splitting caused much of it to be cleaned up.
However, the first 256 bytes are only part of the story. AES-GCM is the most obvious solution, but we also need to fix the downgrade issue. I don't believe that a SCSV to prevent downgrades is viable because our metics suggest 0.1% of connections from Chrome to Google are getting downgraded - likely by broken middleware. Just using the GCM ciphersuite values down into SSLv3 might work. Extra points if we can make it mean ECDHE with P-256 in SSLv3 where the ECC extensions have been removed.

That sounds plausible but also I can see compatibility being a real concern.
The difference between this and BEAST is that this attack, as far as we know, works best (only) at the very start of the encrypted stream. That may leave the door open to mitigations at the application layer that were considered too unreliable for BEAST.
This attack seems to require a lot of carefully-constructed requests. From this, can we assume that the attacker already knows the target URL?
For SPDY, is there a place where we can just stuff ~220 bytes of non-secret junk that the other side can effectively ignore before we start sending anything useful? (Both, from the server and from the client.) If not, we should consider requiring non-RC4 cipher suites for SPDY. The pain of doing that would be very temporary, compared to the HTTP-over-TLS case, as SPDY users are early adopters and have had to jump through significant hoops to use SPDY in the first place.
In a HTTP-over-TLS server (not SPDY), there is a certain amount of metadata in each request that is fixed. For example, here is a request from Firefox Nightly:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: a
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20130312 Firefox/22.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,\*/\*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: <http://www.drudgereport.com/>
Connection: keep-alive
That is already over 300 bytes, and that's not including the 32 bytes from the TLS Finished message. So, in Gecko, if we feel confident that the attacker already knows the request URI and the request host, it is possible that we could simply ensure that all secret text (HTTP auth, cookies, any request body bytes, and any application-set headers) occur at the end of the header block. And/or, we could pad the header block with random data in an extra header as necessary, like this:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: a
P: 2r3--#Q)(#)(\*JF6&rg45G$$g2.... (as long as necessary)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20130312 Firefox/22.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,\*/\*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: <http://www.drudgereport.com/>
Connection: keep-alive
Note that I assume that some sick, horrible servers will break if the Host header isn't the first header. But, if we don't want to make that assumption then we could put the random padding header before the host header.
However, even with such application-specific hacks in place, it would still be good to have a general-purpose, on-by-default, mitigation like the 1/1/1/... splitting in NSS for applications that do not go through this extraordinary effort.

First of all, didn't Google remove the ECC support for SSLv3 (i.e. making NSS require TLS 1.0 for ECC) for some other reason very recently? What was the reason?
Secondly, from the server's perspective the worry of downgrade is much worse than from the browser's side, right? Because, most of the known attacks that make servers worry about CBC mode are avoided as long as the client implements reasonable defenses, right? And, we do. That said, this insecure downgrade issue is old and tired by now. Maybe it is our (browser makers') responsibility to help rip off this band-aid and stop pandering to the intolerant servers in the first place. Still, this seems like a distinctly separate issue to me.

I removed the ECC support for SSLv3 only for the NSS\_ECC\_MORE\_THAN\_SUITE\_B=1
build. In the "not more than Suite B" ECC build, ECC is already disabled
for SSLv3. The reason is that without TLS extensions, we cannot specify
which curves are supported.
Although the NSS\_ECC\_MORE\_THAN\_SUITE\_B=1 supports all the curves specified
for TLS/SSL today, that assumption won't hold as soon as a new curve is
specified for TLS/SSL. This is why I eliminated that difference between
the NSS\_ECC\_MORE\_THAN\_SUITE\_B=1 build and the "not more than Suite B" ECC
build.

Thanks for the clarification Wan-Teh.
Also, thinking more about this, I see why the version downgrade issue is now more related to this than I previously thought. First, there is some confusion/disagreement about whether AES-based cipher suites are allowed in SSLv3 at all. Secondly, I imagine that it will eventually become prudent to first try an TLS handshake without any RC4 cipher suites enabled, and then try again if that handshake fails. I guess it is \*this\* potential for cipher suite downgrade, not version downgrade, that Adam was referring to in his comments about avoiding the downgrade issue.

In that case we could have a hardcoded list of the most important hosts (like google, paypal) that support TLS\_AES (or any other suite different from RC4). Determination can be automated as HSTS preload list has been.

Keep in mind that this is an NSS bug, not a Gecko/Firefox bug. But, yes, a product could do something like that. Ideally, though, we could offer users of NSS's libssl some guidelines that help them avoid the downgrade issue, if we cannot find a solution to it within NSS.

I wrote a proof of concept for Adam's idea at
<https://codereview.chromium.org/12417005/> . Please take a look.
I enhanced Brian's 1/n-1 record splitting code to be able to
split the application data into any number of 1/1/1/.../n-k
records. Currently k=15 (numRecords=16).
I repurpose the existing ss->opt.cbcRandomIV option to also
control record splitting for RC4 cipher suites. I will rename
the option "enableRecordSplitting".
If record splitting becomes a common workaround, we should
improve ssl\_SecureRecv() to return all the received records
at once, rather than one record at a time. I remeber I wrote
a patch to do that while testing Brian's 1/n-1 record
splitting patch, but I can't find that patch.

I dont really see the purpose of fixing the RC4 implementation here. Rejecting the first 256 bytes is not going to solve any problem. You can re-cover > 258 bytes using 2^34 ciphertexts. So its just a question of time, until better methods are found.

Attached patch

[List RC4\_128 cipher suites after AES\_128 cipher suites](attachment.cgi?id=727779&action=diff) (obsolete)
â [Details](attachment.cgi?id=727779&action=edit)
â [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=850478&attachment=727779)

Lowering the priority of RC4\_128 cipher suites in our ClientHello
won't make a difference to servers that support any 256-bit cipher
suite or servers that ignore the cipher suite order in ClientHello.
So this patch is more of a symbolic action to show we are concerned
about the security of RC4 cipher suites.
In this patch I only made the most conservative change, still
listing RC4\_128 cipher suites in the original 128-bit groups.
An alternative would be to form a new group of all the RC4\_128
cipher suites and list that group after all the other 128-bit
groups.

I am fine with opening this bug up. My comments in security-group were a little over-simplified and mostly to set expectations based on conversation in last week's NSS meeting. It isn't that we're not going to do anything (WONTFIX), its that we're not planning to provide a generic "NSS fixes it automatically" solution in the same way that we did for other recent issues.

Looks like the paper was released today (<http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/>). Some discussion at <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6008486>.
Mozilla is notably absent from <http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/#Patches>.

The implementation of AES-GCM and TLS 1.2 (as noted in the Google Chrome) patches are being done through NSS, and thus (largely) apply to Firefox as well, mod PSM/netwerk layer.
Chrome has not yet enabled AES-GCM, so the progress is not substantial over Firefox.

Closed the bug. Not sure if the resolution should be "FIXED" or "WONTFIX".
We have implemented TLS 1.2 and AES-GCM cipher suites, and dropped the
priority of RC4 cipher suites relative to AES cipher suites. But we didn't
come up with any effective countermeasure for RC4 cipher suites.Status: ASSIGNED â RESOLVEDClosed: 11 years agoPriority: -- â P1Resolution: --- â FIXEDWhiteboard: [do not share the attached paper yet!]Target Milestone: --- â 3.15.3

Split RC4-encrypted records.
Ultimately we decided not to do this record splitting, so canceling review request.

Can someone tell me if there is a reason why this issue, fixed in NSS 3.15.3, doesn't have a CVE assigned?
I'm writing an advisory for the NSS update in the current release and want to reference bugs/CVEs that we addressed with the NSS update.

The vulnerability described here is known as [CVE-2013-2566](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-2566) (see link in [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=850478#c22 "RESOLVED FIXED - Deal with \"On the Security of RC4 in TLS\" plaintext recovery attack")).

# USN-2032-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

21 November 2013

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked into connecting to a malicious server, an attacker could possibly

exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash,

potentially execute arbitrary code, or lead to information disclosure.

([CVE-2013-1741](/security/CVE-2013-1741), [CVE-2013-2566](/security/CVE-2013-2566), [CVE-2013-5605](/security/CVE-2013-5605), [CVE-2013-5607](/security/CVE-2013-5607))

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 136 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

**Please note that on March 23, 2016, Oracle released [Security Alert for Java SE for CVE-2016-0636](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2016-0636.html) . Customers of affected Oracle product(s) are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced for CVE-2016-0636.**

Please also note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using versions 3.0 and 2.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS). Future Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts will be scored using CVSS version 3.0 only.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Starting with this Critical Patch Update, security vulnerabilities are now scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0). Previous Critical Patch Updates were scored using CVSS version 2.0. To aid in the transition from CVSS version 2.0 to CVSS version 3.0 scoring, for this Critical Patch Update only, both scores are provided (see  [Critical Patch Update - April 2016 CVSS version 2.0](/security-alerts/cpuapr2016.html)).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review previous  [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2016 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2102148.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2102148.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2016verbose.html#JAVA) .

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.
