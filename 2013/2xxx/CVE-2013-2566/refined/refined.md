Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2566:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2013-2566 in the context of security updates for Firefox, Thunderbird, Mozilla Network Security Service (NSS) and HP Business Service Automation Essentials Core. It appears in Ubuntu Security Notices (USN-2031-1, USN-2032-1), Gentoo Linux Security Advisory (GLSA 201406-19 and GLSA 201504-01) and in HP Security Bulletin (HPSBGN03324).  Also, the blog post from cryptographyengineering.com discusses the RC4 vulnerability with respect to TLS, which is related to the CVE.  The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-103 mentions this CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The core vulnerability lies in the RC4 stream cipher algorithm's biased keystream, making it susceptible to statistical analysis when the same plaintext is encrypted with different keys. In TLS, this can leak information like authentication cookies.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **RC4 Biases:** The RC4 stream cipher produces a keystream that has statistical biases, i.e. the output bytes are not truly random. These biases become exploitable when multiple ciphertexts of the same plaintext, encrypted with different keys, are available.
    *   **TLS usage:** The vulnerability impacts TLS connections where RC4 is used as the encryption algorithm.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially recover encrypted data, particularly authentication cookies, which can allow session hijacking.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Some mentions include the possibility of denial of service due to application crash.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Some of the reports suggests the possiblity of arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker needs to eavesdrop on multiple TLS connections.
    *   **Malicious Javascript:** A web page with malicious Javascript can force the browser to send multiple requests, each of which might use a different key.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** Ability to eavesdrop on network traffic.
    *   **JavaScript Injection:** In some cases the attacker needs to inject Javascript into the victim's browser.
    *   **Dedicated Resources:** The attack requires a large number of TLS connections for successful statistical analysis and plaintext recovery.

**3. Technical details extracted from www.ubuntu.com:**

*   The vulnerability could lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution or information disclosure if a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page or connecting to a malicious server.
*   The vulnerability exists within the Firefox and Thunderbird applications and the underlying Mozilla Network Security Service (NSS) library.
*   Specific Ubuntu versions are vulnerable and fixed in respective package updates.

**4. Technical details extracted from blog.cryptographyengineering.com:**

*   The RC4 cipher generates biased output bytes.
*   An attacker can collect multiple encryptions of the same message under different RC4 keys to perform statistical analysis.
*   Cookies are sent in plain text (although encrypted) over TLS/SSL and can be vulnerable if RC4 is used and an attacker is able to intercept the session.
*   A malicious webpage can generate enough connections in the background using javascript to make the attack feasible.
*   The attack requires tens to hundreds of millions of TLS connections for successful recovery of data.

**5. Technical details extracted from security.gentoo.org:**

*   A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service condition in the Mozilla Network Security Service.
*   The vulnerability exists in NSS versions prior to 3.15.3 and other Mozilla products like Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey.
*   A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code.

**6. Technical details extracted from www.mozilla.org:**

* The vulnerability can be mitigated by lowering the priority of RC4 cipher suites.

**7. Technical details extracted from www.oracle.com:**

* A remote attacker can perform man-in-the-middle attacks and obtain sensitive information.
* Oracle products like Oracle Database, Fusion Middleware and many others are affected by this issue

**8. Technical details extracted from launchpad.net**

* Details that the issue affected Ubuntu packages and that it was resolved by updating the package
* Mentions that the information on the fixes could be found in USN-2031-1 and USN-2032-1

**9. Additional Notes:**

*   The attack exploits the statistical bias in RC4's output, which is more pronounced in the beginning of the keystream.
*   The attack's feasibility depends on the number of ciphertexts of the same message that an attacker can gather.
*   The provided information shows that multiple organizations like Mozilla, Gentoo, HP, and Oracle recognized this vulnerability.
*   The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description.

In summary, CVE-2013-2566 is a significant vulnerability stemming from weaknesses in the RC4 cipher when used in TLS, potentially allowing attackers to recover sensitive information through statistical analysis. The attack vector involves network eavesdropping and potentially malicious javascript injection to acquire multiple ciphertexts of the same plaintext under different keys. Mitigation involves moving away from RC4 to more secure algorithms, implementing workarounds like record splitting, and prioritizing AES over RC4. This vulnerability affects a wide range of products.
