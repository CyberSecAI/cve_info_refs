The provided content is related to CVE-2013-2627.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter within the `leed/action.php?action=removeFolder` endpoint. User input is not escaped, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract information from the database. The provided example uses `BENCHMARK` and `SHA1` to perform a time-based blind SQL injection attack.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to `leed/action.php?action=removeFolder` with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges are required other than access to the application. The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the application's database structure to effectively extract information.
