Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Stack-based buffer overflow in bpe_decompress function**

*   **Root Cause:** The `bpe_decompress` function lacks proper checks on the data being sequentially stored into two 256-byte stack buffers named "left" and "right".
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**  A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a specially crafted packet to port 4868/UDP
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker, with low skill level

**Vulnerability 2: Buffer copy without checking size of input**

*   **Root Cause:** The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without checking if the input buffer size exceeds the output buffer's size.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Buffer copy without checking size of input (CWE-120)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a specially crafted packet to Port 4868/UDP, targeting the handling of the device file specified by the client as an existing Photon session.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker, with a low skill level.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect QNX products: Phrelay, Phwindows, and Phditto.
*   The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   Proof-of-concept code is publicly available.
*   QNX has released a patch for these vulnerabilities.

The provided information aligns with the official CVE description of CVE-2013-2687, which indicates a stack-based buffer overflow, and includes additional detail about a related buffer overflow (CVE-2013-2688) due to a lack of input validation.
