Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-2653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `MemberLoginForm.php` in SilverStripe 3.0.3 allowed user login via GET requests. This meant that authentication details, like email and password, could be passed in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure through Query Strings (CWE-598):** Sensitive information (email and password) were being exposed in the URL, which could be logged, stored in browser history, or intercepted.
*   **Lack of POST enforcement:** The login form did not enforce the use of POST requests which are designed for transmitting sensitive data

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could craft malicious URLs containing login credentials and trick users into clicking them. Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to log in to the victim's account without the victim's knowledge.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The exposed credentials in the URL could be used to hijack a user's session.
*   **Unnoticed Login:** A malicious user could embed the crafted login URL within an iframe on a different website, performing a login without the user noticing it

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** Attackers create a URL with the victim's credentials and send it to the victim.
*   **Phishing Email:** Attackers could include the malicious link in a phishing email.
*   **Embedded Iframe:** Attackers can embed the login URL into an iframe on a malicious website

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know or guess the user's email and password.
*   The attacker needs the ability to get a user to click the malicious URL or visit a page with the malicious iframe
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Fara Rustein of Deloitte Argentina.
*   A fix for this vulnerability was introduced in commit `3e88c98ca513880e2b43ed7f27ade17fef5d9170` which enforces the use of POST requests for login.
*   The fix was slated to be included in the 3.1 release of SilverStripe.

**Summary**
The core vulnerability is the exposure of user credentials in the URL due to the login form's ability to process GET requests which is vulnerable to phishing attacks, session hijacking and can allow for unnoticed login.
