Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2061:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-constant-time `memcmp` function within the `openvpn_decrypt` function when comparing HMACs in OpenVPN UDP mode. This timing difference could be exploited by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Attack:** The non-constant-time `memcmp` allows an attacker to potentially infer information about the HMAC by observing the time it takes for the comparison to complete.
*   **Chosen Ciphertext Injection:** This timing vulnerability can enable chosen ciphertext injection attacks in UDP mode.
*  **Padding Oracle Attack**: A padding oracle attack on the CBC mode cipher implementation of the crypto library could be used for plaintext recovery.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially recover plaintext data by leveraging the timing differences in HMAC comparisons and padding oracle attacks. The recovery rate is estimated to be about one character per 3 hours.
*   **Arbitrary Plaintext Injection:** If OpenVPN is configured to use a null cipher (no encryption), the attacker can inject arbitrary plaintext.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network by sending crafted UDP packets to an OpenVPN server.
*  **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Position**: While not strictly required, a MITM position can make timing measurements more accurate but may not be necessary for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send UDP packets to the vulnerable OpenVPN server.
*   **Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs to be able to measure the time it takes for the server to process packets.
*  **Target-Specific Information**: The attacker may need some target-specific information to be effective, especially if a null cipher is not used.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is considered low severity because a definitive attack vector relies on running OpenVPN with a null cipher.
*   The fix involves replacing the non-constant-time `memcmp` function with a constant-time equivalent.
*   The issue was fixed in OpenVPN version 2.3.1.
*   OpenSSL is used by OpenVPN. PolarSSL is not supported before OpenVPN 2.3.1
