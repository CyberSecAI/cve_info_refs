{
  "cveId": "CVE-2013-2889",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The zeroplus HID driver was not checking the size of allocated values in fields it used. A HID device could send a malicious output report that would cause the driver to write beyond the output report allocation during initialization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow",
       "Improper validation of output report size."
    ],
    "impact": "A physically proximate attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering a heap overflow when CONFIG_HID_ZEROPLUS is enabled in the kernel.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Physically proximate attacker sending a specially crafted HID device output report."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": [
      "Physical access to the vulnerable system.",
       "Ability to craft a malicious HID device output report."
    ]
  },
   "additionalInformation": {
     "patch": "The patch adds a validation to the HID report size before using the output report to prevent writing past the end of the allocated memory.",
    "vulnerableConfig": "The vulnerability is triggered when CONFIG_HID_ZEROPLUS is enabled in the kernel."
  }
