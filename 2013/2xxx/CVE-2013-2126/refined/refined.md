Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-2126:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper error handling in `libraw_cxx.cpp` when processing broken or damaged full-color images, specifically Foveon and sRAW files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Double Free:** A double-free vulnerability exists, where memory allocated for image processing could be freed twice under specific error conditions. This occurs during error recovery when processing damaged full-color files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting the vulnerability can cause the application using LibRaw to crash. This results in a denial of service.
- **Possible Code Execution:** There's a possibility of arbitrary code execution, though the exact mechanism isn't detailed. This usually happens due to memory corruption caused by the double free.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious image files:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted RAW image files, which, when processed by vulnerable applications, can trigger the flawed code.
- **User interaction:** An attacker would need to trick a user or an automated system into processing a malformed RAW image to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create/modify image files:** An attacker needs the ability to create a malformed RAW image or modify an existing one to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User interaction:** The attacker would require the targeted user to open the malicious image via an application that uses the vulnerable LibRaw library

**Additional details:**
- The issue was introduced in LibRaw version 0.14.0
-  The fix involves correcting the error handling within the `src/libraw_cxx.cpp` file.
-  Vulnerable applications include those that embed the affected LibRaw versions like `libkdcraw` and `darktable`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in LibRaw version 0.15.2
