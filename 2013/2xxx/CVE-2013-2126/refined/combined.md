In which libraw version was this problem actually introduced?

darktable uses embedded libraw 0.14.7
libkdcraw uses embedded libraw 0.15.0

I found a commit that introduced the "// allocate image as temporary
buffer, size" stuff within commit 1a8e92ff, and that was part of 0.14.0.

Alex

# USN-1885-1: libKDcraw vulnerability

18 June 2013

libKDcraw could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened
a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libkdcraw](/security/cves?package=libkdcraw) - RAW picture decoding library

## Details

It was discovered that libKDcraw incorrectly handled broken full-color

images. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted raw image, applications linked against libKDcraw could be

made to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

  -
  [4:4.8.5-0ubuntu0.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libkdcraw/4%3A4.8.5-0ubuntu0.2)

After a standard system update you need to restart your session to make all

the necessary changes.

# USN-1884-1: LibRaw vulnerability

18 June 2013

LibRaw could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libraw](/security/cves?package=libraw) - raw image decoder library

## Details

It was discovered that LibRaw incorrectly handled broken full-color images.

If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially

crafted raw image, applications linked against LibRaw could be made to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [libraw5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libraw)
  -
  [0.14.7-0ubuntu1.13.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libraw/0.14.7-0ubuntu1.13.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [libraw5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libraw)

  [0.14.7-0ubuntu1.12.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libraw/0.14.7-0ubuntu1.12.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libraw5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libraw)
  -
  [0.14.4-0ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libraw/0.14.4-0ubuntu2.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart your session to make all

the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
