Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the ` ` (backticks) operator in Ruby within the `download_from_url` method. This method constructs a shell command using `curl` to download content from a user-provided URL. The lack of proper sanitization of the URL allows for the injection of arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the `curl` command being executed by the Ruby code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate the user-supplied URL string to ensure that it conforms to safe parameters and protocols, leading to this vulnerability.
- **Use of Backticks (``) for command execution:** The use of backticks to execute the curl command is problematic because it executes the command in a subshell, making it vulnerable to injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable OpenShift component. This can lead to a full system compromise, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server, steal data, install malware, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted URL provided by the attacker to the vulnerable `download_from_url` method. This URL would contain command injection payloads to be executed on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to submit a crafted URL:** The attacker must have the ability to submit a crafted URL to the vulnerable OpenShift component, which will then be passed to the `download_from_url` method.
- **Network Accessibility:** The target server must be accessible to the attacker in order to send a malicious request.

**Additional Details:**

The provided bugzilla entry highlights the following:

- The vulnerability exists in the `download_from_url` method of OpenShift, specifically in the code that downloads cart URLs.
- It suggests a whitelisting approach for valid URI protocols and hostnames as a mitigation. This includes:
    - Only allowing "http", "https", "git", and "ftp" protocols.
    - Not allowing the "file" protocol.
    - Requiring a specified host that is not localhost.
    - Restricting to external network addresses to prevent internal network probing.
    - Validating the port and path of the URI.

The openwall post confirms the CVE assignment and highlights that the vulnerability existed in upstream source code, but not necessarily deployed in all OpenShift environments.
