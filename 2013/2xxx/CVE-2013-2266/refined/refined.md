Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2266:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `libdns` library, specifically in how it handled regular expression checking within DNS requests. This flawed implementation allowed for excessive memory consumption when processing certain specially crafted queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of regular expression checking in the `libdns` library
- Susceptibility to excessive memory consumption when processing specifically crafted DNS queries
- Potential for denial of service due to memory exhaustion or server crash

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can send a specifically crafted DNS query that causes excessive memory consumption by the `named` (BIND) server process.
- This can lead to a denial of service, potentially resulting in the crash of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted DNS query to a vulnerable BIND server over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the DNS server.
- No special privileges are required for this attack.
- No prior authentication is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects BIND versions 9.7.0 and later, but not BIND 10.
- The fix for this issue involves either upgrading to BIND version 9.8.4-P2, 9.9.2-P2 or recompiling BIND without regular expression support.
-  The vulnerability was addressed by disabling the RDATA regular expression syntax checking.
- Red Hat also notes that this issue did not affect the versions of bind package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.
- This vulnerability has also been associated with CVE-2013-2494
