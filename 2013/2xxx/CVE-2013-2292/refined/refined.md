  "cve": "CVE-2013-2292",
  "description": "The provided content discusses a denial-of-service vulnerability in Bitcoin Core (bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt) related to transaction verification. It involves crafting a transaction with specific script opcodes that force clients to perform an excessive number of SHA-256 hashing operations during signature verification.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that each signature verification in Bitcoin requires the entire transaction to be hashed (with minor modifications). An attacker can exploit this behavior by creating transactions that contain a large number of signature checks, each of which forces a rehash of the transaction data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of resource limits on script execution.",
      "Inefficient transaction hashing during signature verification.",
       "Vulnerability to CPU exhaustion attacks."
    ],
    "impact": "Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by causing excessive CPU usage on Bitcoin clients. This would slow down the blockchain verification process, increase block propagation time, and potentially make the network unstable or unusable. A miner could also use this to increase their chance of finding the next block.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A miner can include the crafted transaction in a block.",
      "The transaction can be relayed via non-standard transaction relaying mining pools that allow direct connections and non-standard transactions."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be either a miner capable of including custom transactions in a block or be able to send the crafted transaction to the Bitcoin network via mining pool that accepts such transactions.",
     "attacker_position": "The attacker can be any miner or user capable of submitting a crafted transaction with fees."
  },
    "suggested_solutions": [
    "Implement a transaction hash cache to temporarily store the last used hash during script evaluation, though this is noted as not fully effective.",
     "Verify ECDSA signature and public key are well-formed before hashing the transaction to reduce hashing operations.",
    "Reduce the maximum transaction size via soft-forking.",
    "Hard-forking the hashing algorithm to allow for caching of certain components of the transaction data."
