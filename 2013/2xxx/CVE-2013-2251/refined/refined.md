Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2251:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the Struts 2 `DefaultActionMapper`. This component supports a mechanism for short-circuiting navigation by using parameters prefixed with "action:", "redirect:", or "redirectAction:".
*   The values following these prefixes were not properly sanitized and were evaluated as OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) expressions against the value stack. This allows for the injection of server-side code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **OGNL Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious OGNL expressions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with the privileges of the application. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data.
*   **System Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete files, install malware, and disrupt services.
*   **Redirection:** In some cases, such as with Cisco MXE 3500 series, an attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameters:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP requests containing the malicious OGNL expressions in parameters prefixed with "action:", "redirect:", or "redirectAction:".
*   **Unauthenticated Exploitation:** For some products, the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, enabling anyone with network access to the vulnerable application to perform the attack. For others, authentication is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker must know to use parameters prefixed with "action:", "redirect:", or "redirectAction:".
*   **Knowledge of OGNL:** The attacker needs a basic knowledge of OGNL to craft their malicious expressions.
*   **Authentication** For some products, authentication may be required.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Apache Struts 2 versions 2.0.0 through 2.3.15.
*   The vulnerability is considered critical.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Struts 2.3.15.1 by sanitizing the "action:" prefixed information. The functionality involving "redirect:" and "redirectAction:" was completely dropped.
*   Multiple vendors such as Cisco and Fujitsu are impacted due to their use of the vulnerable Apache Struts 2 component.
*   Proof-of-concept code is readily available.
