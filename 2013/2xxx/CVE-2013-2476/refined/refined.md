Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-2476:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The HART/IP dissector in Wireshark had a flaw that could lead to an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the HART/IP dissector's processing logic. A malformed packet could cause the dissector to enter an infinite loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition for the user running the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by injecting a malformed HART/IP packet onto the network.
- Alternatively, an attacker could convince a user to open a malformed packet capture file containing a specially crafted HART/IP packet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to inject network traffic or be able to provide a malicious packet capture file to the user running Wireshark.

**Affected versions:**
- Wireshark versions 1.8.0 to 1.8.5 are affected.

**Fixed versions:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark version 1.8.6 and later.
