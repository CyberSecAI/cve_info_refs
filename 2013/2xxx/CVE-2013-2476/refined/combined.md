## wnpa-sec-2013-11 · HART/IP dissector infinite loop

## Summary

**Name:** HART/IP dissector infinite loop

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2013-11

**Date:** March 6, 2013

**Affected versions:** 1.8.0 to 1.8.5

**Fixed versions:** 1.8.6

**References:**

[Wireshark bug 8360](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8360)

[CVE-2013-2476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2476)

## Details

### Description

The HART/IP dissectory could go into an infinite loop.

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources by
injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a
malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.8.6 or later.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<http://www.wireshark.org/download.html>.

### Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages
can be found on the
[download page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty)
on the Wireshark web site.

## File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
About→Folders to find the default locations on your system.

## Known Problems

Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes.
