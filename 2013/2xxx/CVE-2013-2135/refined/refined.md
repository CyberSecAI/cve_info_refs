RELATED: The provided content contains information about CVE-2013-2135.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability arises from two issues within Apache Struts 2:
1. Unescaped or unchecked action names: When using wildcards in action mappings, the requested action name is not properly sanitized or validated against a whitelist before being used in a JSP file path.
2. Double evaluation of OGNL expression: The `TextParseUtil.translateVariables` function performs a double evaluation of OGNL expressions when a combination of '$' and '%' characters are used.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper input validation and sanitization.
- Double evaluation of expressions using OGNL.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote Command Execution: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary Java code on the server by crafting malicious action names in HTTP requests.
- Remote Server Context Manipulation: It allows for manipulation of the remote server's context.
- Malicious Client-Side Code Injection: An attacker can inject client-side code into the server responses.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP requests: By crafting specific HTTP requests with malicious action names, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- Parameters: By manipulating parameters in HTTP requests, an attacker can trigger double evaluation vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required for exploitation.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability exists in Struts versions 2.0.0 to 2.3.14.2.
- The fix involves adding a whitelist of acceptable action names, configurable via `struts.allowed.action.names`, and removing double evaluation of expressions in `OgnlTextParser`.
- It was reported by Jon Passki from Coverity Security Research Laboratory.
- The Oracle content indicates that the vulnerability is fixed in Oracle FLEXCUBE Private Banking by upgrading to Struts 2.3.15.1 and in Oracle WebCenter Sites by upgrading to Struts 2.3.15.3.
