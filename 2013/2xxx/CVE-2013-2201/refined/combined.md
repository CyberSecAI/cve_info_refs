| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=976784#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-21 12:54:50 UTC  ``` On Friday, 2013-06-21 WordPress upstream is about to release new WordPress v3.5.2 version, correcting the following security flaws:  * [CVE-2013-2199](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2199) - SSRF, multiple vulnerabilities:    Inadequate SSRF protection for HTTP requests where the user can provide a URL   can allow for attacks against the intranet and other sites. This is a   continuation of work related to [CVE-2013-0235](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0235), which was specific to SSRF in   pingback requests and was fixed in 3.5.1.  * [CVE-2013-2200](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2200) - Privilege escalation allowing contributors to publish posts:    Inadequate checking of a user's capabilities could allow them to publish posts   when their user role should not allow for it; and to assign posts to other   authors.  * [CVE-2013-2201](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2201) - XSS, multiple vulnerabilities:    Inadequate escaping allowed an administrator to trigger a cross-site scripting   vulnerability through the uploading of media files and plugins.  * [CVE-2013-2202](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2202) - XXE via oEmbed:    The processing of an oEmbed response is vulnerable to an XXE.  * [CVE-2013-2203](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2203) - Full Path Disclosure during File Upload:    If the uploads directory is not writable, error message data returned via XHR   will include a full path to the directory.  And two security flaws in external products:  * [CVE-2013-2204](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2204) - Content Spoofing in the MoxieCode (TinyMCE) MoxiePlayer project:   Upstream patch: <https://github.com/moxiecode/moxieplayer/commit/b61ac518ffa2657e2dc9019b2>  * [CVE-2013-2205](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2205) - Cross-domain XSS in SWFUpload (again):   Fix: Removing security.allowDomain("*") and only allow access from the same domain.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=976784#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-06-22 16:36:48 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5.2>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=976784#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-06-22 16:38:57 UTC  ``` Created wordpress tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 977018](show_bug.cgi?id=977018 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2199 CVE-2013-2200 CVE-2013-2201 CVE-2013-2202 CVE-2013-2203 CVE-2013-2204 CVE-2013-2205 wordpress: Multiple security flaws to be corrected within upstream 3.5.2 version [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 977019](show_bug.cgi?id=977019 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2199 CVE-2013-2200 CVE-2013-2201 CVE-2013-2202 CVE-2013-2203 CVE-2013-2204 CVE-2013-2205 wordpress: Multiple security flaws to be corrected within upstream 3.5.2 version [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=976784#c3)  Fedora Update System    2013-07-03 01:35:46 UTC  ``` wordpress-3.5.2-1.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

Debian Bug     : 713947

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead of
backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

CVE-2013-2173

    A denial of service was found in the way wordpress performs hash
    computation when checking password for protected posts. An attacker
    supplying carefully crafted input as a password could make the
    platform use excessive CPU usage

CVE-2013-2199

    Multiple server-side requests forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities were
    found in the HTTP API. This is related to CVE-2013-0235, which was
    specific to SSRF in pingback requests and was fixed in 3.5.1

CVE-2013-2200

     Inadequate checking of a user's capabilities could lead to a
     privilege escalation, enabling them to publish posts when their
     user role should not allow for it and to assign posts to other
     authors

CVE-2013-2201

    Multiple cross-side scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to badly
    escaped input were found in the media files and plugins upload forms

CVE-2013-2202

    XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability via oEmbed
    responses

CVE-2013-2203

    A Full path disclosure (FPD) was found in the file upload mechanism.
    If the upload directory is not writable, the error message returned
    includes the full directory path

CVE-2013-2204

    Content spoofing via flash applet in the embedded tinyMCE media
    plugin

CVE-2013-2205

    Cross-domain XSS in the embedded SWFupload uploader

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.2+dfsg-1~deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.2+dfsg-1~deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.2+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

# WordPress 3.5.2 Maintenance and Security Release

---

WordPress 3.5.2 is now available. This is the second maintenance release of 3.5, fixing [12 bugs](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=3.5.2). **This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.** The WordPress security team resolved seven security issues, and this release also contains some additional security hardening.

The security fixes included:

* Blocking server-side request forgery attacks, which could potentially enable an attacker to gain access to a site.
* Disallow contributors from improperly publishing posts, reported by [Konstantin Kovshenin](http://kovshenin.com/), or reassigning the post’s authorship, reported by [Luke Bryan](http://www.sharefaith.com/).
* An update to the SWFUpload external library to fix cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Reported by [mala](http://ma.la) and [Szymon Gruszecki](http://mars.iti.pk.edu.pl/~grucha/). (Developers: More on SWFUpload [here](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/06/21/secure-swfupload/).)
* Prevention of a denial of service attack, affecting sites using password-protected posts.
* An update to an external TinyMCE library to fix a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Reported by [Wan Ikram](http://twitter.com/rinakikun).
* Multiple fixes for cross-site scripting. Reported by [Andrea Santese](http://webapplicationsecurity.altervista.org/) and Rodrigo.
* Avoid disclosing a full file path when a upload fails. Reported by [Jakub Galczyk](http://hauntit.blogspot.de/).

We appreciated [responsible disclosure](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security) of these issues directly to our security team. For more information on the changes, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5.2) or consult [the list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.5?rev=24498&stop_rev=23347).

[Download WordPress 3.5.2](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.5.2.zip) or update now from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site’s admin area.

*Also:* **WordPress 3.6 Beta 4:** If you are testing WordPress 3.6, please note that [WordPress 3.6 Beta 4](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.6-beta4.zip) (zip) includes fixes for these security issues.
