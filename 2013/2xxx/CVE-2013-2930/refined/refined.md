{
  "CVE-2013-2930": {
    "description": "The perf_trace_event_perm function in kernel/trace/trace_event_perf.c in the Linux kernel before 3.12.2 does not properly restrict access to the perf subsystem, which allows local users to enable function tracing via a crafted application.",
    "root_cause": "The perf_trace_event_perm function used perf_paranoid_kernel() check which returns false for the default perf paranoid level '1', thus not restricting function tracing access to root.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect access control",
      "Insufficient check for enabling function tracing"
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged local user can enable function tracing, potentially gaining access to sensitive kernel information and causing a denial of service by making the system unusable.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user exploitation"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "Local user access"
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability was introduced in commit ced39002f5ea736b716ae233fb68b26d59783912 and fixed in commit 12ae030d54ef250706da5642fc7697cc60ad0df7. The fix involves using perf_paranoid_tracepoint_raw() which only provides access to function tracing when the perf paranoid level is -1"
  }
