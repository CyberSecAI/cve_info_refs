Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue when CGit is configured to read a readme file from a filesystem path instead of a Git repository.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal:  The application does not properly sanitize or validate the file path provided, allowing an attacker to use ".." sequences to navigate outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Read: A remote attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's local filesystem that the CGit application has access to. This could expose sensitive information, configuration files, passwords etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Request: By crafting a specific URL with directory traversal sequences. An example is provided: `<http://somehost/?url=/somerepo/about/../../../../etc/passwd>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote access to a CGit instance.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability, or the ability to probe for its existence.
- The CGit configuration must have the feature enabled that reads readme files from a filesystem filepath.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in CGit versions prior to the fix. OpenSUSE provided patches for version 0.8.3.3, 0.9.0.2 and 0.9.1 to address the vulnerability. The fix was included in CGit version 0.9.2.
- The vulnerability is not present by default. It occurs when the administrator has explicitly configured CGit to use a filesystem path for the readme file.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the maintainer of CGit during an audit of the codebase and was promptly patched.
