Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-2161:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of account strings within XML listings in Swift account servers. Specifically, these strings were not being escaped before inclusion in XML responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unescaped user-controlled input is directly embedded in XML responses.
- This can lead to the generation of malformed or arbitrary XML.
- The vulnerability resides in the `AccountController` class' GET method within the `swift.account.server` module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential to generate unparseable or arbitrary XML responses.
- This can be used to leverage other vulnerabilities in software that consumes these XML responses, such as third-party UI's, log scanners, API metric engines, etc..
- While not a direct exploit like remote code execution, it creates an avenue for more complex attacks by affecting systems that integrate with or consume data from Swift.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting account names with malicious characters (e.g., unescaped quotes).
- When Swift generates the XML listing of accounts, it includes these unescaped names.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a GET request is made to an account server for account listing in XML format, and the account name contains malicious characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create accounts with names that include malicious characters.
- An attacker needs to be able to make GET requests to the vulnerable server, specifying xml output.
- This vulnerability would be accessible by authenticated users that can create accounts.

**Additional Notes:**
- Several sources mention that while a direct exploit was not immediately apparent, the potential for leveraging this to exploit vulnerabilities in other systems was the key concern.
- The fix involves escaping the account names before including them in XML responses.
- The vulnerability was addressed in multiple OpenStack releases: master, stable/grizzly, and stable/folsom.
