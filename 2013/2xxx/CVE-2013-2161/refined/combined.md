Package        : swift
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2161 CVE-2013-4155

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Swift, the Openstack
object storage. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-2161

    Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in XML
    handling within Swift account servers. Account strings were
    unescaped in xml listings, and an attacker could potentially
    generate unparsable or arbitrary XML responses which may be
    used to leverage other vulnerabilities in the calling software.

CVE-2013-4155

    Peter Portante from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Swift.
    By issuing requests with an old X-Timestamp value, an
    authenticated attacker can fill an object server with superfluous
    object tombstones, which may significantly slow down subsequent
    requests to that object server, facilitating a Denial of Service
    attack against Swift clusters.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version $squeeze_VERSION.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.8-2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your swift packages.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Bug Description

See the code here: <https://github.com/openstack/swift/blob/master/swift/account/server.py#L255> . The ``account`` var is untrusted and should be escaped.

I'm not 100% convinced this is exploitable, however after conferring with Donald Stufft (security engineer at Nebula), neither of us were able to rule it out, so I'm filing as a security issue, better safe than sorry.

Agree on need to fix. Don't really see how to exploit that since you reap what you seed... and XSS-like scenarios sound very far-fetched.

Adding Rob Clark from OSSG to see if he sees a blatant way of exploiting this that I'd have missed.

The vulnerability looks real enough though I share the difficulty in identifying a clear attack vector. It's possible that this could be leveraged to attack platforms with Swift UI front ends - uploaders and such but that may be a stretch.

There's no obvious way to exploit it but history is littered with 'unexploitable vulnerabilities' that were later exploited. I'd like to see this follow the normal security process.

This is more a comment on general OpenStack security policy than on this specific issue - I believe that when a security vulnerability has been identified and verified it should be treated as a sensitive issue and fixed using the same process that's used when exploitation scenarios have been identified.

Okay, so how do I submit code for this? I was working on [bug 1183169](/bugs/1183169) (another bug), and the fix for that touched the code for this bug, so I included a fix. (It's exactly the fix in Alex Gaynor's patch; there's not too many ways to skin this particular cat.)

So, can I submit my patch to Gerrit? Do I need to remove my fix for this bug from that patch? Do I submit a fix, but not reference this bug number? Something completely different?

It's best if a security fix can be as discrete and self-contained as possible, since this helps downstream distributors backport it more easily to arbitrary releases they may be packaging/supporting. I'm in the process of drafting an attempted impact description for this and need to get a couple swift core +2 votes in this bug (subscribed them just now) for the fix proposed in comment #2 or some alternative minimal implementation.

And to more explicitly answer your questions in comment #7, yes you'll need to remove your fix for this from your other review before you submit it to Gerrit. Otherwise that would require us to consider this issue already publically disclosed and we'd need to rush out a corresponding announcement.

Seeing as the result of this bug causes invalid XML (rather than eg a remote code execution), I'd vote to open this bug publicly.

The issue is perhaps if this code is parsed anywhere else, while not strictly a direct flaw in OpenStack, allowing OpenStack flaws to be used as an attack vector to compromise deployer's services is very undesirable. I'm ok with it being dealt with openly but would still like to see a CVE.

About impact, I find the description both too detailed and not sufficiently clear about impact :) My suggestion:

Title: Unchecked user input in Swift XML responses

Reporter: Alex Gaynor (Rackspace)

Products: Swift

Affects: All versions

Description:

Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in XML handling within Swift account servers.

By including malicious data into account names, an attacker could potentially generate unparsable or

arbitrary XML responses, which may be used to leverage other vulnerabilities in the calling software.

Our Gerrit code review infrastructure is entirely public, so any fixes pushed there would prematurely disclose this private, embargoed security issue.

OpenStack's vulnerability management process is documented at <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vulnerability_Management> . We are collectively in the Patch Review and Review Impact Description stages of the Embargoed Vulnerability Management Process.

From the "fixing it" side of things, Swift core developers should hopefully be reading the diff posted here in comment #2 and testing it out privately or proposing alternative fixes as diff attachments to this private security bug. Similarly the Swift PTL reads the Impact description proposed in comment #14, and if necessary suggests modifications to its wording.

Once we've got at least two Swift core reviewers in support of a patch attached this bug, have Swift PTL approval of the Impact Description, have requested and have received a CVE assignment for the bug, then we'll pick a disclosure date and provide advance warning to our registered downstream stakeholders (packagers et al). On the selected disclosure date the pre-approved patch will be published to Gerrit and approved through CI/merged concurrent with publication of an OpenStack Security Advisory to appropriate public mailing lists.

Thank you for the link to TFM. :)

I think the code change in the attachment "escape.diff" is a good\* fix for this bug, so +2 from me.

\* it could use a unit test, but we can add that on in a separate, public commit once this lands

I echo everything Sam said, particularly w.r.t the quality of the proposed patch.

Here's my take on an impact description (I'm unsure about the correct tense:"were" vs. "are"):

Title: Unchecked user input in Swift XML responses

Reporter: Alex Gaynor (Rackspace)

Products: Swift

Affects: All versions

Description:

Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in XML handling within Swift account servers.

Account strings were unescaped in xml listings, and an attacker could potentially generate unparsable or

arbitrary XML responses which may be used to leverage other vulnerabilities in the calling software.

Agreed (mine was a bit of a stab in the dark). I'll go ahead and request a CVE with John's wording from comment #19, and then we can get rolling with notifications once that comes back. Thanks!

It looks like this moved to another file while the patch was under discussion, and so needs to be updated. I'm attaching an amended diff.

commit 92d7eadd328797d392758c79e258c8455874c80e

Author: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>

Date: Thu Jun 13 11:13:36 2013 -0700

Better escaping for GET /v1/a?format=xml.

Commit 8f9b135 fixed a bug where an XML attribute could have arbitrary

    characters jammed into it, resulting in a document with arbitrary

    tags... and it did remove the ability to get an arbitrary XML document

    out of the object server. However, it left a couple of ways to get a

    malformed XML document, one example of which is an account named ".

This fixes up the remaining ways and ensures you always get a

    well-formed XML document in the account-listing response. Also, it

    adds a unit test for the escaping of the container name; this was

    already working, just untested.

If you look in the discussion for [bug 1183884](/bugs/1183884), you'll see that the

    review comments there are basically "seems good, but could use a unit

    test". (The astute reader will note that I am one of the guilty

    parties in that review.)

I found this bug while writing the missing unit test.

The moral of this story is left as an exercise for the reader.

Fixes [bug 1183884](/bugs/1183884) harder.

### Bug Description

See the code here: <https://github.com/openstack/swift/blob/master/swift/account/server.py#L255> . The ``account`` var is untrusted and should be escaped.

I'm not 100% convinced this is exploitable, however after conferring with Donald Stufft (security engineer at Nebula), neither of us were able to rule it out, so I'm filing as a security issue, better safe than sorry.

I don't know about exploitability, but it's certainly true that an account named AUTH\_" produces this little pile of invalid XML on GET:

Agree on need to fix. Don't really see how to exploit that since you reap what you seed... and XSS-like scenarios sound very far-fetched.

Adding Rob Clark from OSSG to see if he sees a blatant way of exploiting this that I'd have missed.

The vulnerability looks real enough though I share the difficulty in identifying a clear attack vector. It's possible that this could be leveraged to attack platforms with Swift UI front ends - uploaders and such but that may be a stretch.

Let me know how you guys prefer to handle this, if it's decided to not be a security vulnerability I'll just go through the normal patch submission process.

There's no obvious way to exploit it but history is littered with 'unexploitable vulnerabilities' that were later exploited. I'd like to see this follow the normal security process.

This is more a comment on general OpenStack security policy than on this specific issue - I believe that when a security vulnerability has been identified and verified it should be treated as a sensitive issue and fixed using the same process that's used when exploitation scenarios have been identified.

Okay, so how do I submit code for this? I was working on [bug 1183169](/bugs/1183169) (another bug), and the fix for that touched the code for this bug, so I included a fix. (It's exactly the fix in Alex Gaynor's patch; there's not too many ways to skin this particular cat.)

So, can I submit my patch to Gerrit? Do I need to remove my fix for this bug from that patch? Do I submit a fix, but not reference this bug number? Something completely different?

It's best if a security fix can be as discrete and self-contained as possible, since this helps downstream distributors backport it more easily to arbitrary releases they may be packaging/supporting. I'm in the process of drafting an attempted impact description for this and need to get a couple swift core +2 votes in this bug (subscribed them just now) for the fix proposed in comment #2 or some alternative minimal implementation.

And to more explicitly answer your questions in comment #7, yes you'll need to remove your fix for this from your other review before you submit it to Gerrit. Otherwise that would require us to consider this issue already publically disclosed and we'd need to rush out a corresponding announcement.

Seeing as the result of this bug causes invalid XML (rather than eg a remote code execution), I'd vote to open this bug publicly.

The issue is perhaps if this code is parsed anywhere else, while not strictly a direct flaw in OpenStack, allowing OpenStack flaws to be used as an attack vector to compromise deployer's services is very undesirable. I'm ok with it being dealt with openly but would still like to see a CVE.

To clarify the above 'else' means other systems consuming or integrating with Swift, 3rd party UI's, Log scanners, API metrics engines etc.

About impact, I find the description both too detailed and not sufficiently clear about impact :) My suggestion:

Title: Unchecked user input in Swift XML responses

Reporter: Alex Gaynor (Rackspace)

Products: Swift

Affects: All versions

Description:

Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in XML handling within Swift account servers.

By including malicious data into account names, an attacker could potentially generate unparsable or

arbitrary XML responses, which may be used to leverage other vulnerabilities in the calling software.

Our Gerrit code review infrastructure is entirely public, so any fixes pushed there would prematurely disclose this private, embargoed security issue.

OpenStack's vulnerability management process is documented at <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vulnerability_Management> . We are collectively in the Patch Review and Review Impact Description stages of the Embargoed Vulnerability Management Process.

From the "fixing it" side of things, Swift core developers should hopefully be reading the diff posted here in comment #2 and testing it out privately or proposing alternative fixes as diff attachments to this private security bug. Similarly the Swift PTL reads the Impact description proposed in comment #14, and if necessary suggests modifications to its wording.

Once we've got at least two Swift core reviewers in support of a patch attached this bug, have Swift PTL approval of the Impact Description, have requested and have received a CVE assignment for the bug, then we'll pick a disclosure date and provide advance warning to our registered downstream stakeholders (packagers et al). On the selected disclosure date the pre-approved patch will be published to Gerrit and approved through CI/merged concurrent with publication of an OpenStack Security Advisory to appropriate public mailing lists.

I think the code change in the attachment "escape.diff" is a good\* fix for this bug, so +2 from me.

\* it could use a unit test, but we can add that on in a separate, public commit once this lands

I echo everything Sam said, particularly w.r.t the quality of the proposed patch.

Here's my take on an impact description (I'm unsure about the correct tense:"were" vs. "are"):

Title: Unchecked user input in Swift XML responses

Reporter: Alex Gaynor (Rackspace)

Products: Swift

Affects: All versions

Description:

Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in XML handling within Swift account servers.

Account strings were unescaped in xml listings, and an attacker could potentially generate unparsable or

arbitrary XML responses which may be used to leverage other vulnerabilities in the calling software.

commit 92d7eadd328797d392758c79e258c8455874c80e

Author: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>

Date: Thu Jun 13 11:13:36 2013 -0700

Better escaping for GET /v1/a?format=xml.

Commit 8f9b135 fixed a bug where an XML attribute could have arbitrary

    characters jammed into it, resulting in a document with arbitrary

    tags... and it did remove the ability to get an arbitrary XML document

    out of the object server. However, it left a couple of ways to get a

    malformed XML document, one example of which is an account named ".

This fixes up the remaining ways and ensures you always get a

    well-formed XML document in the account-listing response. Also, it

    adds a unit test for the escaping of the container name; this was

    already working, just untested.

If you look in the discussion for [bug 1183884](/bugs/1183884), you'll see that the

    review comments there are basically "seems good, but could use a unit

    test". (The astute reader will note that I am one of the guilty

    parties in that review.)

I found this bug while writing the missing unit test.

The moral of this story is left as an exercise for the reader.

Fixes [bug 1183884](/bugs/1183884) harder.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-swift security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0993)

## Topic

Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue and one bug
are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Swift (<http://swift.openstack.org>) is a highly available,
distributed, eventually consistent object/blob store.

An XML injection flaw in OpenStack Swift could allow remote attackers
to manipulate the contents of XML responses via specially-crafted data.
This could be used to trigger a denial of service. (CVE-2013-2161)

Red Hat would like to thank Alex Gaynor from Rackspace for reporting this
issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* If permissions on the "/etc/swift/" directory were incorrect, services

(such as swift-proxy-server) flooded the console and "/var/log/messages"
with "UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION" errors, including a traceback and "Permission
denied: '/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf'" message. This could occur when
restarting a service or updating the packages. (BZ#967631)

All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing this update, the
OpenStack Swift services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack grizzly x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 967631](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=967631)
  - swift keeps spamming console when it cannot access config.
* [BZ - 972988](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=972988)
  - CVE-2013-2161 OpenStack Swift: Unchecked user input in Swift XML responses
