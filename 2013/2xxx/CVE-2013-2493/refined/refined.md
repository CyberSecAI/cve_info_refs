Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-2493 (based on the associated bug report [178415](http://crbug.com/178415) linked in the provided content, this bug is the root cause of the fix discussed in issue 12395021).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of protocol data mappings in Chrome Frame when opening a non-Chrome Frame (CF) top-level tab from a CF page. Specifically, the protocol data mapping for "attach external tab" requests was being prematurely invalidated during the `IInternetProtocol::Terminate` call. This would lead to a crash when `IInternetProtocol::UnlockRequest` was subsequently called, as it would rely on the now-missing mapping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Improper Resource Management:** The core issue is the premature invalidation of the protocol data mapping. The code was not correctly handling the lifecycle of these mappings, leading to a dangling pointer situation when `UnlockRequest` was called.
-   **Incorrect State Management:** The protocol sink mapping was being treated as a regular ChromeFrame request and thus terminated, which was incorrect for attach tab requests. This shows an error in the state transition and lifecycle management of the mapping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Crash:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash in Chrome Frame. This would result in the termination of the Chrome Frame instance and potentially disrupt the user experience.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **User Interaction:** The attack vector requires user interaction on a web page rendered within Chrome Frame and then opening a link to a page outside of Chrome Frame in a new tab. The link needs to trigger the "attach external tab" scenario.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Webpage within Chrome Frame:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage rendered via Chrome Frame, with a link that will cause the browser to try to open a new tab outside of chrome frame.
-   **Trigger specific action:** The attacker must cause the "attach external tab" scenario through the linked resource.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The code review ([12395021](https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/12395021/)) provides more detail than the description of the associated bug report ([178415](http://crbug.com/178415)). It explains the specific sequence of API calls that led to the crash (`IInternetProtocol::LockRequest`, `IInternetProtocolRoot::Terminate`, and then `IInternetProtocol::UnlockRequest`).
- The fix involved not invalidating the protocol data mapping for attach tab requests which are identified through a special `gcf://attach_external_tab` protocol.
- The fix was committed in revision 185956.

In summary, the vulnerability was caused by a race condition and incorrect state management within the Chrome Frame implementation while handling non-CF top-level tab openings from CF pages. The fix addresses this by preserving the protocol data mapping for external tab requests, thus preventing the crash during the `UnlockRequest` call.
