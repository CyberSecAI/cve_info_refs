Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from stack overflow issues within the XML parser used by the BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) software, specifically in both the client and server components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack Overflow:** The core issue is the presence of stack overflow vulnerabilities in the XML parser. This implies that by providing specially crafted XML input, an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, leading to potential control of the program's execution flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting a stack overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system. This means the attacker can potentially gain complete control of the machine.
*  **Service Disruption:**  Exploitation could also lead to denial of service, causing the client or server to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*  **Malicious XML Input:** The attack vector is through the manipulation of XML data that is processed by the vulnerable parser. This input can be provided by a malicious server to a client, or in the server side via different input vectors (like a malformed request).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Hostile Server:** The attacker could exploit a vulnerable client by controlling or impersonating a BOINC server and sending crafted XML responses.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to have the ability to send manipulated XML data to the vulnerable component (client or server).

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is believed to affect BOINC versions 7.x. It's uncertain if versions 6.12 or earlier are affected.
*   The vulnerability was found and reported by Alyssa Milburn, who notified relevant projects in early March.
* The provided commit ID is: 2fea03824925cbcb976f4191f4d8321e41a4d95b
