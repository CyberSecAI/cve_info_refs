| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=981124#c0)  Garth Mollett    2013-07-04 05:29:36 UTC  ``` Charlet, Ricky <ricky.charlet> reports:  Howdy,  I'm gonna describe an ospfd bug that happened to me and a proposed patch. But at the top of this email, I want to say that I'm really not familiar enough with this code to suggest that this patch is "the right thing".  I'm looking for some double checking here. On the other hand, I think it is important. This is an on-stack, buffer overflow susceptible to input from the network in code that implements, what seems to me, to be a very minor feature.  I setup a network that, upon a single network event, sent over router LSAs representing 150 networks. The actual traffic broke down into about 100 ls-update packets, many of which are len=1480, and some of which are ip-fragmented. The ls-updates tend to grow in size. The largest (re-assembled) one was the last one at 1840 bytes.  While processing the received LSAs, we crash with  gdb backtrace points to memcpy called from new_msg_lsa_change_notify. By code review, I see that we memcpy into a buffer with a length we learned from the input, not governed by the length of the available buffer. In my patch, I suggest that we govern the memcpy by the length of the available buffer.  <patch> Index: ospfd/ospf_api.c =================================================================== --- ospfd/ospf_api.c    (revision 10875) +++ ospfd/ospf_api.c    (working copy) @@ -639,7 +639,7 @@    nmsg->area_id = area_id;    nmsg->is_self_originated = is_self_originated;    memset (&nmsg->pad, 0, sizeof (nmsg->pad)); -  memcpy (&nmsg->data, data, ntohs (data->length)); +  memcpy (&nmsg->data, data, sizeof(struct lsa_header));     return msg_new (msgtype, nmsg, seqnum, len);  }</patch>  I tested the above, passing in the same large router-lsa's and it survives/passes.  Sssooo.... I'm not one to pretend I understand what 'clients' might be interested in this lsa-update message. I looked at the ospfclient.c: lsa_update_callback() and it apparently does not care about anything beyond the header.  Certianly, in our implementation, we have no clients at all listening for these messages.   Is it apprpriate to trunkate this ls-update message to the header only, or should a solution be built for passing arbitrarily large messages to clients?   Additionally, how about the code that is sending the ls-updates?  I did not look into it myself. But we may be a poor citizen if we are sending ls-updates which need to be reassembled into large buffers.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=981124#c1)  Garth Mollett    2013-07-04 05:36:12 UTC  ```  Created quagga tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 981126](show_bug.cgi?id=981126 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - quagga: CVE-2013-2236 Quagga: OSPFD Potential remote code exec (stack based buffer overflow) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=981124#c3)  Garth Mollett    2013-07-04 05:44:58 UTC  ``` Please note: The above patch, while preventing the memcpy overflow may not be a complete fix as len may still be used from the wire in other places without sanity checking.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=981124#c12)  Florian Weimer    2013-07-04 13:19:45 UTC  ``` I proposed another fix: <<http://lists.quagga.net/pipermail/quagga-dev/2013-July/010625.html>>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=981124#c18)  Huzaifa S.

# USN-2941-1: Quagga vulnerabilities

24 March 2016

Quagga could be made to crash or run programs if it received specially
crafted network traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [quagga](/security/cves?package=quagga) - BGP/OSPF/RIP routing daemon

## Details

Kostya Kortchinsky discovered that Quagga incorrectly handled certain route

data when configured with BGP peers enabled for VPNv4. A remote attacker

could use this issue to cause Quagga to crash, resulting in a denial of

service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2342](/security/CVE-2016-2342))

It was discovered that Quagga incorrectly handled messages with a large

LSA when used in certain configurations. A remote attacker could use this

issue to cause Quagga to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-2236](/security/CVE-2013-2236))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [quagga](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/quagga)
  -
  [0.99.24.1-2ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/quagga/0.99.24.1-2ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [quagga](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/quagga)
  -
  [0.99.22.4-3ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/quagga/0.99.22.4-3ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

  [0.99.20.1-0ubuntu0.12.04.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/quagga/0.99.20.1-0ubuntu0.12.04.4)

After a standard system update you need to restart Quagga to make all the

necessary changes.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Binary packages built by this source

[quagga](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/quagga):
BGP/OSPF/RIP routing daemon

GNU Quagga is free software which manages TCP/IP based routing protocols.

 It supports BGP4, BGP4+, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, RIPv1, RIPv2, and RIPng as

 well as the IPv6 versions of these.

 .

 As the precessor Zebra has been considered orphaned, the Quagga project

 has been formed by members of the zebra mailing list and the former

 zebra-pj project to continue developing.

 .

 Quagga uses threading if the kernel supports it, but can also run on

 kernels that do not support threading. Each protocol has its own daemon.

 .

 It is more than a routed replacement, it can be used as a Route Server and

 a Route Reflector.

[quagga-dbg](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/quagga-dbg):
BGP/OSPF/RIP routing daemon (debug symbols)

This package provides debugging symbols for all binary packages built from

 quagga source package. It's highly recommended to have this package installed

 before reporting any Quagga crashes to either Quagga developers or Debian

 package maintainers.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1316571#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-10 14:03:48 UTC  ``` bgpd: Fix VU#270232, VPNv4 NLRI parser memcpys to stack on unchecked length      A vulnerability was found in a way VPNv4 NLRI parser copied packet data to the stack. Memcpy to stack data structure based on length field from packet data whose length field upper-bound was not properly checked.      This likely allows BGP peers that are enabled to send Labeled-VPN SAFI routes to Quagga bgpd to remotely exploit Quagga bgpd.      Mitigation: Do not enable Labeled-VPN SAFI with untrusted neighbours.      Impact: Labeled-VPN SAFI is not enabled by default.      * bgp_mplsvpn.c: (bgp_nlri_parse_vpnv4) The prefixlen is checked for   lower-bound, but not for upper-bound against received data length.   The packet data is then memcpy'd to the stack based on the prefixlen.        Extend the prefixlen check to ensure it is within the bound of the NLRI   packet data AND the on-stack prefix structure AND the maximum size for the   address family.  Upstream fix:  <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/quagga.git/commit/?id=a3bc7e9400b214a0f078fdb19596ba54214a1442>  External references:  <http://mirror.easyname.at/nongnu//quagga/quagga-1.0.20160309.changelog.txt>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1316571#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-10 14:04:27 UTC  ```  Created quagga tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1316572](show_bug.cgi?id=1316572 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2342 quagga: VPNv4 NLRI parses memcpys to stack on unchecked length [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1316571#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-14 10:44:24 UTC  ``` References:  <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/270232>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1316571#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-03-21 11:58:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:0794 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0794.html>   ``` |  |

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0794)

## Topic

An update for quagga is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The quagga packages contain Quagga, the free network-routing software suite that manages TCP/IP based protocols. Quagga supports the BGP4, BGP4+, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, RIPv1, RIPv2, and RIPng protocols, and is intended to be used as a Route Server and Route Reflector.

Security Fix(es):

* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Quagga handled IPv6 router advertisement messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the zebra daemon resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2016-1245)
* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Quagga BGP routing daemon (bgpd) handled Labeled-VPN SAFI routes data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the bgpd daemon resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2016-2342)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the Quagga BGP routing daemon (bgpd). Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could send a crafted packet to crash the bgpd daemon resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2016-4049)
* A denial of service flaw affecting various daemons in Quagga was found. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the various Quagga daemons, which expose their telnet interface, to crash. (CVE-2017-5495)
* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Quagga OSPFD daemon handled LSA (link-state advertisement) packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the ospfd daemon resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2013-2236)

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 Release Notes and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 Technical Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the bgpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
