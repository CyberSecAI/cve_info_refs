## Synopsis

Moderate: python-keystoneclient security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0944)

## Topic

Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix one security issue and
multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly)
Preview.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Python-keystoneclient is the client library and command line utility for
interacting with the OpenStack identity API.

A flaw in Keystone allowed an attacker with access to the web and network
interfaces of services utilizing python-keystoneclient (such as Nova,
Cinder, Swift, Glance, and so on) to continue using PKI tokens that had
expired. This would allow the attacker to continue using the PKI tokens
despite the PKI tokens being expired, giving them continued access to
OpenStack services. (CVE-2013-2104)

This issue was discovered by Eoghan Glynn of Red Hat.

This update also fixes a number of bugs in python-keystoneclient.

All users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview are advised to install
these updated packages.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

# USN-1851-1: python-keystoneclient vulnerability

3 June 2013

The python client library for Keystone did not properly verify expired PKI
tokens.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [python-keystoneclient](/security/cves?package=python-keystoneclient) - Client library for OpenStack Identity API

## Details

Eoghan Glynn and Alex Meade discovered that python-keystoneclient did not

properly perform expiry checks for the PKI tokens used in Keystone. If

Keystone were setup to use PKI tokens (the default in Ubuntu 13.04), a

previously authenticated user could continue to use a PKI token for longer

than intended.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [python-keystoneclient](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keystoneclient)
  -
  [1:0.2.3-0ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keystoneclient/1%3A0.2.3-0ubuntu2.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Requires backport of <https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/commit/62be31419f3a8765407ad583110fc7d36fb64dcf>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=928558#c6)  Pavel Sedlák    2013-06-06 18:15:14 UTC  ``` Verified with python-keystoneclient-0.2.3-2.el6ost. When cache = swift.cache is set in filter:authtoken section of swift/proxy-server.conf, authtoken m/w in proxy-server reports that it will use memcache from swift.cache.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Subject: [OSSA 2013-014] Missing expiration check in Keystone PKI tokens validation
 (CVE-2013-2104)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-014
CVE: CVE-2013-2104
Date: May 28, 2013
Title: Missing expiration check in Keystone PKI tokens validation
Reporter: Eoghan Glynn (Red Hat), Alex Meade (Rackspace)
Products/Affects: Keystone (Folsom only), python-keystoneclient (0.2.0+)

Description:
Eoghan Glynn from Red Hat and Alex Meade from Rackspace both reported a
vulnerability in expiry checks for PKI tokens in the Keystone
authentication middleware. Expired tokens for authenticated users could
continue to be used, potentially resulting in the bypass of intended
security policies. The effect of PKI token revocation is also reversed
when the token expires, in the sense that a revoked token is once again
treated as being valid. Only setups using PKI tokens are affected.

Note:
The affected code was added to Keystone in the Folsom release, but was
moved to python-keystoneclient during the Grizzly development cycle.

python-keystoneclient fix (will be included in upcoming 0.2.4 release):
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/30742/>

Keystone (Folsom) fix:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-05-21 20:49:54 UTC  ``` Thierry Carrez (thierry) reports:  Title: Missing expiration check in Keystone PKI token validation Reporter: Eoghan Glynn (Red Hat) Products/Affects: Keystone (Folsom only), python-keystoneclient (0.2.0+)  Description: Eoghan Glynn from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in expiry checks for PKI tokens in the Keystone authentication middleware. Expired tokens for authenticated users could continue to be used, potentially resulting in the bypass of intended security policies. The effect of PKI token revocation is also reversed when the token expires, in the sense that a revoked token is once again treated as being valid. Only setups using PKI tokens are affected.  Note: The affected code was added to Keystone in the Folsom release, but was moved to python-keystoneclient during the Grizzly development cycle.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-05-21 20:54:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 751373](attachment.cgi?id=751373&action=diff "keystone-folsom-CVE-2013-2104.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=751373&action=edit "keystone-folsom-CVE-2013-2104.patch") keystone-folsom-CVE-2013-2104.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-05-21 20:55:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 751374](attachment.cgi?id=751374&action=diff "python-keystoneclient-master-CVE-2013-2104.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=751374&action=edit "python-keystoneclient-master-CVE-2013-2104.patch") python-keystoneclient-master-CVE-2013-2104.patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-27 13:15:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 753617](attachment.cgi?id=753617&action=diff "Updated keystone-folsom-CVE-2013-2104.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=753617&action=edit "Updated keystone-folsom-CVE-2013-2104.patch") Updated keystone-folsom-CVE-2013-2104.patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c7)  Vincent Danen    2013-05-28 22:28:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 754099](attachment.cgi?id=754099&action=diff "The final patch from upstream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=754099&action=edit "The final patch from upstream") The final patch from upstream   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c8)  Vincent Danen    2013-05-28 22:33:23 UTC  ``` The upstream patch is available here:  <https://github.com/openstack/keystone/commit/8d23da1302dde9d38bbc227d9aba30da919b60c8>  And the upstream announcement is here:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/05/28/7>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c9)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-29 13:20:11 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the version of the openstack-keystone package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17.  --  This issue affects the version of the openstack-keystone package, as shipped with Fedora release of 18 and Fedora EPEL-6.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c10)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-29 13:21:36 UTC  ``` Created openstack-keystone tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 968328](show_bug.cgi?id=968328 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2104 OpenStack Keystone: Missing expiration check in Keystone PKI token validation [fedora-18]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 968330](show_bug.cgi?id=968330 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2104 OpenStack Keystone: Missing expiration check in Keystone PKI token validation [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c11)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-04 14:11:43 UTC  ``` Created python-keystoneclient tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 970659](show_bug.cgi?id=970659 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-2104 OpenStack Keystone: Missing expiration check in Keystone PKI token validation [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-rawhide [[bug 970660](show_bug.cgi?id=970660 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2013-2104 OpenStack Keystoneclient: Missing expiration check in Keystone PKI token validation [fedora-19]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c12)  Murray McAllister    2013-06-06 13:25:27 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Eoghan Glynn of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c15)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-12 10:56:16 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the python-keystoneclient package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17, 18, and Fedora EPEL-6.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-12 16:43:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0944 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0944.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=965852#c17)  Fedora Update System    2013-07-12 19:37:49 UTC  ``` openstack-keystone-2012.2.4-5.el6 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 6 stable repository.

# USN-1875-1: OpenStack Keystone vulnerabilities

14 June 2013

Keystone did not always properly verify expired PKI tokens or properly
authenticate users.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [keystone](/security/cves?package=keystone) - OpenStack identity service

## Details

Eoghan Glynn and Alex Meade discovered that Keystone did not properly

perform expiry checks for the PKI tokens used in Keystone. If Keystone were

setup to use PKI tokens, a previously authenticated user could continue to

use a PKI token for longer than intended. This issue only affected Ubuntu

12.10 which does not use PKI tokens by default. ([CVE-2013-2104](/security/CVE-2013-2104))

Jose Castro Leon discovered that Keystone did not properly authenticate

users when using the LDAP backend. An attacker could obtain valid tokens

and impersonate other users by supplying an empty password. By default,

Ubuntu does not use the LDAP backend. ([CVE-2013-2157](/security/CVE-2013-2157))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [python-keystone](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone)
  -
  [1:2013.1.1-0ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone/1%3A2013.1.1-0ubuntu2.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [python-keystone](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone)
  -
  [2012.2.4-0ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone/2012.2.4-0ubuntu3.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

### Bug Description

Unless I'm mistaken the keystoneclient auth\_token middleware seems to be neglecting to check the expiry of signed tokens.

Instead, it only checks if the proposed token has been explicitly revoked:

<https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth_token.py#L1047>

Surely the expiration timestamp needs to be checked also and the token rejected if expired.

Making sure I understand this correctly...

Your patch fixes \_cache\_put() so that it doesn't store expired tokens... But \_cache\_get() seems to properly implement expiration check so it will not return expired tokens. So is this really exploitable ? Or exploitable only if the token is not in the cache already ?

It seems like that is the case on first glance, but further investigation of the code shows otherwise. The cache\_get function does not return anything if the value is expired, but then the calling code treats that as a cache miss, and re-verifies the token. For a UUID token, this would mean going back to the server, and thus get a status of "Invalid." However, with PKI tokens, it just reruns the validation code in process which was not checking the expiration time. So the original cache validation is not effective in checking token expiration.

The test included in the patch couldn't be any simpler to illustrate the issue; Big +1 for that! (and it fails without the corresponding fix)

I'm lost though on why the patch is so big? Why do ALL the examples/pki/ files have to be recreated, rather than just adding the two new files? (auth\_token\_scoped\_expired.json and auth\_token\_scoped\_expired.xml). +2 otherwise!

the pem files are the signed versions of those files. We don't regenerate them on the fly. So, even though the only change in the JSON file is the date, it completely changes the signature.

Proposed impact description:

Title: Expiration check failure in Keystone PKI tokens validation

Reporter: Eoghan Glynn (Red Hat)

Products/Affects: Keystone (Folsom only), python-keystoneclient (0.2.0+)

Description:

Eoghan Glynn from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in expiry checks for PKI tokens in the Keystone authentication middleware. Expired tokens for authenticated users could continue to be used as long as the user wasn't disabled, potentially resulting in the bypass of intended security policies. Only setups using PKI tokens are affected.

Note:

The affected code was added to Keystone in the Folsom release, but was moved to python-keystoneclient during the Grizzly development cycle.

That brings up interesting point.

If I'm reading the keystone code correctly, only \*non-expired\* revoked tokens are returned from Driver.list\_revoked\_tokens(), at least in the SQL case:

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/token/backends/sql.py#L128>

So a token that has been both revoked \*and\* expired would not be reported as revoked (presumably the assumption here is that the token would fall in any case on the expiry-check hurdle, so no need to pollute the reported revoked list with really old tokens).

IIUC this makes the vulnerability a tad worse, as the effect of revocation is reversed if the token is re-used post-expiry.

That brings up interesting point.

I've confirmed that the effect of signed token revocation is reversed when the token is expires (as envisaged in the previous comment).

IMO this should be reflected in the impact description, e.g. by adding the line:

"The effect of signed token revocation is also reversed when the token expires, in the sense that a revoked token is once again treated as being valid."

This one is getting better and better :) New version:

---------------------------------------------------------

Title: Missing expiration check in Keystone PKI tokens validation

Reporter: Eoghan Glynn (Red Hat)

Products/Affects: Keystone (Folsom only), python-keystoneclient (0.2.0+)

Description:

Eoghan Glynn from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in expiry checks for PKI tokens in the Keystone authentication middleware. Expired tokens for authenticated users could continue to be used, potentially resulting in the bypass of intended security policies. The effect of PKI token revocation is also reversed when the token expires, in the sense that a revoked token is once again treated as being valid. Only setups using PKI tokens are affected.

Note:

The affected code was added to Keystone in the Folsom release, but was moved to python-keystoneclient during the Grizzly development cycle.

One could argue that I need two other than the patch author, but you guys decide (and Eoghan +1ed too).

Waiting for a CVE assignment, will probably push downstream early next week.

@ayoung: Thanks for the rebase. It looks like the python-keystoneclient patch also needs a rebase on top of 11263ac3 (to account for changes in tests/test\_auth\_token\_middleware.py). Any chance you could have a look ?
