Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the failure of the `auth_token` middleware in OpenStack Keystone (specifically in Folsom release) and `python-keystoneclient` (versions 0.2.0+) to check the expiration of signed (PKI) tokens. The middleware would check for token revocation but neglected to verify if a token's validity period had expired.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Expiration Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of an expiration check for PKI tokens during authentication, which should be a standard security practice for any token-based system
*   **Bypassed Security Policy:** By not enforcing token expiration, the system bypassed intended security policies, allowing expired tokens to be used for authentication.
*   **Reversed Revocation:** The effect of token revocation was reversed if a revoked token also expired. Normally, a revoked token would be considered invalid and unusable, but if it had also expired, the system would no longer treat it as revoked, and it becomes usable again.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker in possession of an expired PKI token could continue to access OpenStack services, essentially bypassing the intended security controls.
*   **Prolonged Access:** Users could maintain access longer than intended, even if their token should have expired or been revoked
*   **Security Policy Bypass:** The missing expiration check allowed for a bypass of the system's intended security policies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to services using python-keystoneclient in order to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Existing Token:** The attacker must have obtained a valid PKI token previously.
*   **Token Reuse:**  The attacker reuses the expired token to access OpenStack services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to services using `python-keystoneclient`.
*   **Valid PKI Token Acquisition:** The attacker must have previously obtained a valid PKI token. The token must have been valid at some point for a valid user.
*   **Awareness of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the missing expiration check and how to abuse it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially present in Keystone Folsom but was later moved to `python-keystoneclient` in the Grizzly release cycle.
*   The issue only affects setups using PKI tokens. UUID tokens were handled differently with proper checks.
*   The fix explicitly adds an expiration check and rejects expired tokens. Test data was also updated to reflect this.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Eoghan Glynn (Red Hat) and Alex Meade (Rackspace).
*   Patches were released to address this, both for Folsom (Keystone) and python-keystoneclient
*   The severity of the vulnerability was rated as 'Moderate' by Red Hat.
