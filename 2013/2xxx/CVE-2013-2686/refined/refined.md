Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2686:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a fix implemented for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2012-5976) in Asterisk's HTTP server. The fix replaced `alloca()` with `malloc()`, which allows the allocation of memory based on the `Content-Length` header of an HTTP POST request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The `Content-Length` header, which is user-controlled, dictates the size of the memory allocated using `malloc()`. An attacker can manipulate this header to request an excessive amount of memory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By sending HTTP POST requests with very large `Content-Length` values, an attacker can exhaust the memory available to Asterisk, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Exhaustion:** Successful exploitation leads to the exhaustion of the server's memory.
- **Service Disruption:** The server process can be terminated by the operating system, causing a denial of service.
- **Temporary DoS Possible:** Even without completely filling the memory, the server can be brought to a state where it is unable to process requests, resulting in a temporary DoS. This is achievable even over low-bandwidth connections.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP POST requests.
- **Content-Length Header:** The `Content-Length` header is the primary mechanism for controlling memory allocation.
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Sessions:** The vulnerability is exploitable by remote, unauthenticated attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Asterisk server.
- **HTTP Request Generation:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests with arbitrary `Content-Length` header values.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves capping the `Content-Length` at 1024 bytes. Requests exceeding this limit are rejected with an HTTP 413 response.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Asterisk, including both open-source and certified builds.
- Patches are provided to address the vulnerability.
