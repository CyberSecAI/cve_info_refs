### Bug Description

The memcache encryption middleware in python-keystoneclient is improperly implemented such that it does not provide expected data integrity and privacy properties.

<https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/memcache_crypt.py>

When the 'ENCRYPT' security strategy is used, it encrypts the data with raw AES, which provides no authentication properties. This means that an attacker can modify the ciphertext freely, changing the values which are decoded by the client. In most cases, this will produce garbage in one or more blocks of the decrypted text. By inspecting the behavior of the system after modification of the ciphertext, an attacker may be able to decode some or all of the encrypted message. Even if the attacker cannot decode the message, they can corrupt what should be trusted values used by the system.

Furthermore, because the decryption relies on an optional prefix when deciding whether or not to decrypt data, an attacker can simply omit the prefix to inject arbitrary data which is trusted by the client.

The encryption routine should properly sign the encrypted blob before storing it in the cache, and verify the integrity of the signature before decrypting the blob. When using the ENCRYPT security strategy, the system should reject all values which are not properly signed and encrypted.

The key derivation function should produce different values based on the security strategy, such that a key from the MAC security strategy will not validate when ENCRYPT is selected, and the reverse. More details on proper key derivation functions are available in NIST Special Publication 800-108.

As currently written, this feature provides minimal security benefits. I will be proposing a patch later today to fix the issues outlined above. I plan to fix this issue in a forwards-compatible way, with the side effect of invalidating existing ephemeral cache values for users who have enabled this feature. This should have a CVE. I'm ok with marking this bug as public given the minimal potential for exploitation (an attacker needs access to the memcache instance, which should never happen in a proper deployment) and the assumed low usage rate of this feature.

This patch is untested, but I believe it to be a mostly complete implementation of the fix.

The unittests obviously need to be updated to match this.

I think it makes sense to fix both issues you reported in embargo mode, even if their exploitation is a bit unlikely... after all, those features were added to mitigate a risk, and they don't really mitigate it.

Here is my attempt to summarize impact (for both)

Title: Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature

Reporter: Paul McMillan (Nebula)

Products: python-keystoneclient

Affects: [? any idea when in client history that was introduced]

Description:

Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the signing/encryption security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache\_servers) and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache\_security\_strategy are affected.

Yes, we should get absolutely get rid of the marker checking logic. Error out if we can't verify or decrypt data.

An attacker have access to memcache can corrupt data. I don't think adding signature before encryption can prevent that.

If attacker managed to get a hold of the encryption key, signing key is likely compromised as well.

I would think the benefit of adding signature prior to encryption is to guard against brute force attack on the decryption.

You're right about embargoing the fix. The security notice looks good other than that it may be worth noting that a mitm attacker can also carry out the same attacks.

> An attacker have access to memcache can corrupt data. I don't think adding signature before encryption can prevent that.

The difference is that adding a signature before encryption means we reject the corrupted data as invalid, rather than accepting it

and potentially serving attack data to the user. Remember that an attacker can modify the output of the decryption even if they can't read the encrypted data. As currently written, the client will trust that modified data.

> If attacker managed to get a hold of the encryption key, signing key is likely compromised as well.

That may be true, but recommended practice is to make them different keys as I did in my patch, so that you don't end up with subtle related-key attacks. In particular, it is pretty common to have a key re-used in multiple parts of a program result in attacks where signed or encrypted data from one part of a program can be used to attack a different part even if the attacker doesn't actually know the key. The NIST document I reference in the bug report includes more details.

> I would think the benefit of adding signature prior to encryption is to guard against brute force attack on the decryption.

Nope, it's about integrity of the decrypted data, and choosing to not attempt to decrypt the data unless the integrity is verified. For a practical example of the types of attacks this prevents, you can read about the BEAST and CRIME attacks against SSL.

Can you please elaborate? How does attacker "modify the output of the decryption"? If attacker don't have to right decryption key, the decrypted output will be garbage and won't be interpreted as token data.

An attacker modifies the output of the decryption by changing bytes in the ciphertext. The encryption algorithm does not, by itself, reject this, and as you noted, this muddles some of the output. It is not true that it muddles all the output, however. Specifically, in the cipher mode currently used, modified bytes in the ciphertext will affect one block of output. If any significant amount of data is stored in the cache, this can allow strategic corruption of only a portion of the encrypted message, leaking information about the encrypted data or compromising client functionality.

For some examples of attacks on similar systems, I recommend reading these papers:

<http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2002/EUROCRYPT/2850/2850.pdf> (the Vaudenay paper - a really good introduction)

<http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/033.pdf> (an attack on PGP's particular use of CFB)

<http://static.usenix.org/event/woot10/tech/full_papers/Rizzo.pdf> (the SSL oracle paper I mentioned above)

For further reading, I recommend Cryptography Engineering, by Ferguson, Schneier and Kohno.

Patch looks quite good, similar code to what I am implementing in oslo-incubator, with some minor differences.

I wonder if we want to make it possible to interchange it so that we can consolidate later ?

Some observations:

- I would use HKDF (exapand) from RFC 5869 for the key derivation, insted of just a plain HMAC, as that function has properties that are desirable (I have an implementation available if we want that I have implemented for message signing and can contribute it).

- On the ciphers/hash sides, I think SHA256 would be sufficient, also I would find AES 128 in CBC (as we do not need a stream cipher here) mode wiith random IV prefereable, given AES-128 is faster and also seem has (relatively) less weaknesses than AES-256

- Returning a CACHE\_KEY as derivation from the secret is not necessary, you could as well just return the random IV as the kay as it is already exposed in the data anyway. There is no reason to use a piece of a HMAC output signature as a key that I can see, and I rather not publish any key material, derived or not.

None of these remarks are critical, I think all security properties that we want from this change are fullfilled with the current approach as well.

Some responses to Simo:

- HKDF is fine, but I believe that the approach taken in this patch is also fine. This approach has the benefit of being easier to implement / understand.

- This patch uses AES-128-CBC already. It uses SHA-384 per NIST's recommendation on key derivation. This is needed to produce 3 128 bit keys.

- I'm a little confused on your concerns about returning the cache key. Reusing the IV for a different purpose seems like a bad idea.

Some remarks:

- HKDF would allow you to use SHA256 and obtain up to 10 blocks of material good for keys. Plus it allows key derivation with arbitrary salt (if you use extraction which is not needed) and arbitrary additional info if you need to make the key derivation unique (equivalent to using a serialzied tokena s you do here I guess).

But the reason I suggest it is that it is a true and tested Key Derivation Function while HMAC technically is not, and taking shortcuts tend to have undesirable consequences in the long run. Although I am not concerned in this case.

- AES 128 true, the original code mentioned AES256 and it stuck, however both the old and the new code use MODE\_CFB not MODE\_CBC

- Ignore the IV part you can't look it up so it is not suitable as a memcahce key indeed, pity that, could have saved some space too :) I am still somewhat uncomfortable using a key derived from a secret as a public handle, but it is probably ok.

Plus it allows key derivation with arbitrary salt (if you use extraction which is not needed) and arbitrary additional info if you need to make the key derivation unique (equivalent to using a serialzied tokena s you do here I guess).
But the reason I suggest it is that it is a true and tested Key Derivation Function while HMAC technically is not, and taking shortcuts tend to have undesirable consequences in the long run. Although I am not concerned in this case.
- AES 128 true, the original code mentioned AES256 and it stuck, however both the old and the new code use MODE\_CFB not MODE\_CBC
- Ignore the IV part you can't look it up so it is not suitable as a memcahce key indeed, pity that, could have saved some space too :) I am still somewhat uncomfortable using a key derived from a secret as a public handle, but it is probably ok.

- If you would like to update the patch to include HKDF, I wouldn't object.

- This patch does use AES-128-CBC. I promise! Go check again :-) I worked with Paul on creating a padding scheme to make CBC possible here. Note the line: AES.new(key, AES.MODE\_CBC, iv)

- If you have an alternate suggestion here, I'm open to it. As it is, I can't think of an attack vector with the current code.

I am sorry Bryan,

apparently when I re-checked about the mode I looked at the first patch in this bug, which used MODE\_CFB.

I just checked the last patch does use MODE\_CBC, so all fine there.

For HKDF here is my current WIP implementation:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/28471/>

Look into openstack/common/cryptoutils.py there is a class called HKDF, it can be very easily extracted and reused for this bug.

I do not see attack vectors with the current code either. I checked that signed/encrypted blobs could not be swapped for example, but if I understand correctly the full token is used to derive the keys so there should be no way to swap blobs and have authentication pass.

In theory there is a 1 in a 2^64 chance (I think, probably lower) that 2 tokens will generate the same cache\_key, but I do not see how that could be practically used in any way.

In response to Brant Knudson:

> file keystoneclient/middleware/auth\_token.py:

> line 848: suggest use "not ..." rather than "is None"

> line 895: suggest use "not ..." rather than "is None"

I'm deliberately using None rather than accepting 0, [], '', etc. because the documentation specifies the way to skip the security strategy is to omit the key. I don't think that an empty string is an acceptable way to specify "no security", and I want this code to fail loudly if it is improperly configured.

> line 860: Not sure what "This" is referring to, is it the memcache\_crypt.unprotect\_data function or the \_cache\_get function?

Good point, I'll clarify the point that this is a reminder to the reader that unprotect\_data can return None and is not always a json value.

> line 864: no need to include exception string because LOG.exception will print it out.

Good point, I'll fix that.

> line 870: suggest use "not serialized rather than "is None"

This was an abundance of caution about parsing unexpected data. There should be no paths where serialized is not one of None or a valid parsable json, and I'd prefered to have a json decode failure (which makes it obvious that data like 0, '', (), etc. is unexpected) rather than silently returning None. That said, I'm not particularly tied to this use, if you don't buy the argument.

> line 875: comment doesn't make sense since would have returned at 871 if serialized is None.

On the contrary, this is entirely the point. At this point in the code, we have returned if serialized was None (indicating a cache miss or other error), and we know we should be holding a json decodable string. What we know is that the string is NOT the value 'null' which deserializes to None. This comment is asserting that we have not made the common cache/serialization mistake of not differentiating between a stored serialized value of None and a cache miss. This is why we can safely do the "data, expires = cached" expansion a couple lines down.

(note that I'm not wild about the way this works, but I'm fixing the crypto here, not rewriting the caching middleware)

Yep, that was a holdover from the original code. I'll fix it.

Added.

Good catch, fixed that.

In response to Simo Sorce:

A few notes about this:

We do need to obscure the key as well as the value here. The cache key is usable as an authentication token in other parts of the stack. Because we are doing this, it is inappropriate to talk about salting it, since if we did that we would be unable to look up any values. Furthermore, because this is a caching layer, we don't want to be doing extra work if we can avoid it, which is why I didn't use more than one round of hashing in the KDF.

I do not believe HKDF is appropriate here. Unlike many other uses of KDFs, the input keying material is expected to be of good quality to begin with. People should not be using a password or similar for generating this secret key, and this key is not derived from some other source an attacker may know something about. Furthermore, we do not need 10 blocks of key material, we need exactly 3. Additionally, it is inappropriate to salt these values because that would make it impossible to look up cached material. If you read the SP800-108 document closely, you'll notice that we're basically using one round of the approved KDF (we could prepend a 1 to the hashed value if you want to be pedantic).

However, as you've observed, if the secret material doesn't have enough entropy, this construction breaks down. I've conservatively added a requirement that the secret be at least 48 bytes long, which should reinforce the security of the construct.

Paul,

just a point, on HKDF, I was recommending to use just expand, and not the extract phase of HKDF, so no salt would be required (and technically you can avoid the salt on the extract phase too, the RFC recommends it but says it is not critical.

I am not sure you really need 384 bits for the secret, but won't hurt.

I did not know the cache key was used as an authentication token elsewhere though, can you elaborate that? It's worrying.

Looks like the patch could still use a few rounds of discussion, so we'll wait a bit more before calling keystone core to formally pre-approve it.

I don't think the 'ignore-expires' parameter makes sense: if the value in the caches is expired, either from a memcache or a reading of the timestamp on the underlying token, it should be considered invalid. Passing a parameter to somehow modify this seems wrong: we can and should be draconian on this. Why was this added?

Note that there is a more serious CVE with a fix already, and I think this one conflicts with that fix. Please rebase this on top of the change for [https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/+bug/1179615](https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/%2Bbug/1179615) keeping the message signatures in the patch for putting into the cache with the expiration time exposed.

Minor nit: line 192 breaks the pattern of the comment block when splitting over multiple lines, looks like an stray return snuck in.

Odd, run\_tests.sh fails for me but tox succeeds. I suspect that's my fault: <https://gist.github.com/dolph/d5a37860a76b1553d770>

That snippet looks like [bug 1185231](/bugs/1185231) (testrepository) but if tox on its own is succeeding then unit tests on the Jenkins slaves should be similarly fine (they all run under tox).

commit eeefb784f24c37d5f56a421e1ccc911cace9385e

Author: Bryan D. Payne <email address hidden>

Date: Fri Jun 7 09:34:25 2013 -0700

Fix memcache encryption middleware

This fixes lp1175367 and lp1175368 by redesigning the memcache crypt

    middleware to not do dangerous things. It is forward compatible, but

    will invalidate any existing ephemeral encrypted or signed memcache

    entries.

## Topic

Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix two security issues, one
bug, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0
(Grizzly) Preview.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

Python-keystoneclient is the client library and command line utility for
interacting with the OpenStack identity API.

A flaw was found in the way python-keystoneclient handled encrypted data
from memcached. Even when the memcache\_security\_strategy setting in
"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf" was set to ENCRYPT to help prevent
tampering, an attacker on the local network, or possibly an unprivileged
user in a virtual machine hosted on OpenStack, could use this flaw to
bypass intended restrictions and modify data in memcached that will later
be used by services utilizing python-keystoneclient (such as Nova, Cinder,
Swift, Glance, and so on). (CVE-2013-2166)

A flaw was found in the way python-keystoneclient verified data from
memcached. Even when the memcache\_security\_strategy setting in
"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf" was set to MAC to perform signature
checking, an attacker on the local network, or possibly an unprivileged
user in a virtual machine hosted on OpenStack, could use this flaw to
modify data in memcached that will later pass signature checking in
python-keystoneclient. (CVE-2013-2167)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Paul McMillan of Nebula as the original
reporter.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* python-webob1.2 (which can be installed in parallel with python-webob1.0)

was not found by python-keystoneclient. Attempting to import python-webob
from python-keystoneclient failed with a stack trace. This could also be
observed with other applications using python-keystoneclient, such as
OpenStack Swift. With this update, python-keystoneclient can import
python-webob1.2 independently from other installed versions. (BZ#971026)

Additionally, this update adds the following enhancement:

* This update adds support for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Signature Version

4 to python-keystoneclient. This makes python-keystoneclient compatible
with future versions of python-boto, which will use Signature Version 4 by
default. (BZ#970134)

All users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview are advised to install
these updated packages, which correct these issues and add this
enhancement.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 19:49:46 UTC  ``` Thierry Carrez (secalert) reports:  Title: Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature Reporter: Paul McMillan (Nebula) Products: python-keystoneclient Affects: version 0.2.3 to 0.2.5  Description: Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the encryption ([CVE-2013-2166](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2166)) or signing ([CVE-2013-2167](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2167)) security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers) and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache_security_strategy are affected.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 19:59:06 UTC  ``` In general the memcached for OpenStack (and any memcached deployment generally speaking) should be restricted to trusted systems due to the lack of authentication in memcached. However the signing/encryption of data within memcached is an attempt to alleviate this problems so systems using these capabilities may have exposed memcached to untrusted systems.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 20:40:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 760946](attachment.cgi?id=760946&action=diff "client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=760946&action=edit "client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch") client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 20:48:34 UTC  ``` Red Hat OpenStack 1 (Essex) and 2.1 (Folsom) do not contain the affected code and are not affected as such.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:43:05 UTC  ``` THIs is now public <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/06/19/5>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c10)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:44:36 UTC  ``` Created python-keystoneclient tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 976024](show_bug.cgi?id=976024 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-2166 CVE-2013-2167 python-keystoneclient: middleware memcache encryption and signing bypass [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c11)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:45:18 UTC  ``` Created python-keystoneclient tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 976025](show_bug.cgi?id=976025 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-2166 CVE-2013-2167 python-keystoneclient: middleware memcache encryption and signing bypass [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c13)  Murray McAllister    2013-06-24 06:35:10 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these issues.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-06-20 10:52:55 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-017 CVE: CVE-2013-2166, CVE-2013-2167 Date: June 19, 2013 Title: Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature Reporter: Paul McMillan (Nebula) Products: python-keystoneclient Affects: version 0.2.3 to 0.2.5  Description: Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the encryption (CVE-2013-2166) or signing (CVE-2013-2167) security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers) and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache_security_strategy are  affected.  python-keystoneclient fix (will be included in upcoming 0.2.6 release): <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/33661>  References: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/+bug/1175367](https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/%2Bbug/1175367) <http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2166> [https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/+bug/1175368](https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/%2Bbug/1175368) <http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2167>    @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please say explicitly if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2013-06-20 14:44:49 UTC  ``` fixed in python-keystoneclient-0.2.4-r2 0.2.4-r1 removed from tree  No vulnerable ebuilds in tree, good to close from my perspective. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-06-30 13:18:20 UTC  ``` Agreed.

### Bug Description

The memcache signing middleware in python-keystoneclient is improperly implemented, such that it does not provide the advertised data integrity features. An attacker with access to the memcache instance used as a cache could insert false or changed data which would be silently accepted by the client.

<https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/memcache_crypt.py>

When the 'MAC' security strategy is enabled, the middleware falls through to silently trusting data which is missing the "MAC\_MARKER" prefix. When this mode is enabled, the middleware should require all data to be signed, and raise an error when encountering unsigned or incorrectly signed data.

Furthermore, the construction of the MAC:

h(data || token)

is improper, accepting attacker generated signatures with trivial effort since it involves no data which is not available to an attacker.

Instead, it should use the standard HMAC construction:

HMAC (K,m) = H ((K ⊕ opad) ∥ H ((K ⊕ ipad) ∥ m))

where K is a secret key, m is the message, and opad and ipad are standard constants.

The secret key should be produced using an approved key derivation function which differs from the key used when the 'ENCRYPTION' security strategy is in use. More details on appropriate functions are available in NIST Special Publication 800-108.

As currently written, this feature provides no security benefits whatsoever. I will be proposing a patch later today to fix the issues outlined above. I plan to fix this issue in a forwards-compatible way, with the side effect of invalidating existing ephemeral cache values for users who enabled this feature. This should have a CVE. I'm ok with marking this bug as public given the minimal potential for exploitation (an attacker needs access to the memcache instance, which should never happen in a proper deployment) and the assumed low usage rate of this feature.

Fix memcache encryption middleware

This fixes lp1175367 and lp1175368 by redesigning the memcache crypt

    middleware to not do dangerous things. It is forward compatible, but

    will invalidate any existing ephemeral encrypted or signed memcache

    entries.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 19:49:46 UTC  ``` Thierry Carrez (secalert) reports:  Title: Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature Reporter: Paul McMillan (Nebula) Products: python-keystoneclient Affects: version 0.2.3 to 0.2.5  Description: Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the encryption ([CVE-2013-2166](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2166)) or signing ([CVE-2013-2167](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2167)) security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers) and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache_security_strategy are affected.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 19:59:06 UTC  ``` In general the memcached for OpenStack (and any memcached deployment generally speaking) should be restricted to trusted systems due to the lack of authentication in memcached. However the signing/encryption of data within memcached is an attempt to alleviate this problems so systems using these capabilities may have exposed memcached to untrusted systems.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 20:40:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 760946](attachment.cgi?id=760946&action=diff "client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=760946&action=edit "client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch") client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 20:48:34 UTC  ``` Red Hat OpenStack 1 (Essex) and 2.1 (Folsom) do not contain the affected code and are not affected as such.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:43:05 UTC  ``` THIs is now public <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/06/19/5>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c10)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:44:36 UTC  ``` Created python-keystoneclient tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 976024](show_bug.cgi?id=976024 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-2166 CVE-2013-2167 python-keystoneclient: middleware memcache encryption and signing bypass [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c11)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:45:18 UTC  ``` Created python-keystoneclient tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 976025](show_bug.cgi?id=976025 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-2166 CVE-2013-2167 python-keystoneclient: middleware memcache encryption and signing bypass [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c13)  Murray McAllister    2013-06-24 06:35:10 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these issues.

Thanks. Uploaded.

Though I've noticed that some of the unit tests are failing after
applying the patch (3 failures). I don't know if that is expected or
not... though for what I'm doing, the client worked (keystone
service-list, keystone tenant-list, etc. worked)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Bug Description

The memcache encryption middleware in python-keystoneclient is improperly implemented such that it does not provide expected data integrity and privacy properties.

<https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/memcache_crypt.py>

When the 'ENCRYPT' security strategy is used, it encrypts the data with raw AES, which provides no authentication properties. This means that an attacker can modify the ciphertext freely, changing the values which are decoded by the client. In most cases, this will produce garbage in one or more blocks of the decrypted text. By inspecting the behavior of the system after modification of the ciphertext, an attacker may be able to decode some or all of the encrypted message. Even if the attacker cannot decode the message, they can corrupt what should be trusted values used by the system.

Furthermore, because the decryption relies on an optional prefix when deciding whether or not to decrypt data, an attacker can simply omit the prefix to inject arbitrary data which is trusted by the client.

The encryption routine should properly sign the encrypted blob before storing it in the cache, and verify the integrity of the signature before decrypting the blob. When using the ENCRYPT security strategy, the system should reject all values which are not properly signed and encrypted.

The key derivation function should produce different values based on the security strategy, such that a key from the MAC security strategy will not validate when ENCRYPT is selected, and the reverse. More details on proper key derivation functions are available in NIST Special Publication 800-108.

As currently written, this feature provides minimal security benefits. I will be proposing a patch later today to fix the issues outlined above. I plan to fix this issue in a forwards-compatible way, with the side effect of invalidating existing ephemeral cache values for users who have enabled this feature. This should have a CVE. I'm ok with marking this bug as public given the minimal potential for exploitation (an attacker needs access to the memcache instance, which should never happen in a proper deployment) and the assumed low usage rate of this feature.

I think it makes sense to fix both issues you reported in embargo mode, even if their exploitation is a bit unlikely... after all, those features were added to mitigate a risk, and they don't really mitigate it.

Here is my attempt to summarize impact (for both)

Title: Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature

Reporter: Paul McMillan (Nebula)

Products: python-keystoneclient

Affects: [? any idea when in client history that was introduced]

Description:

Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the signing/encryption security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache\_servers) and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache\_security\_strategy are affected.

Yes, we should get absolutely get rid of the marker checking logic. Error out if we can't verify or decrypt data.

An attacker have access to memcache can corrupt data. I don't think adding signature before encryption can prevent that.

If attacker managed to get a hold of the encryption key, signing key is likely compromised as well.

I would think the benefit of adding signature prior to encryption is to guard against brute force attack on the decryption.

You're right about embargoing the fix. The security notice looks good other than that it may be worth noting that a mitm attacker can also carry out the same attacks.

> An attacker have access to memcache can corrupt data. I don't think adding signature before encryption can prevent that.

The difference is that adding a signature before encryption means we reject the corrupted data as invalid, rather than accepting it

and potentially serving attack data to the user. Remember that an attacker can modify the output of the decryption even if they can't read the encrypted data. As currently written, the client will trust that modified data.

> If attacker managed to get a hold of the encryption key, signing key is likely compromised as well.

That may be true, but recommended practice is to make them different keys as I did in my patch, so that you don't end up with subtle related-key attacks. In particular, it is pretty common to have a key re-used in multiple parts of a program result in attacks where signed or encrypted data from one part of a program can be used to attack a different part even if the attacker doesn't actually know the key. The NIST document I reference in the bug report includes more details.

> I would think the benefit of adding signature prior to encryption is to guard against brute force attack on the decryption.

Nope, it's about integrity of the decrypted data, and choosing to not attempt to decrypt the data unless the integrity is verified. For a practical example of the types of attacks this prevents, you can read about the BEAST and CRIME attacks against SSL.

Can you please elaborate? How does attacker "modify the output of the decryption"? If attacker don't have to right decryption key, the decrypted output will be garbage and won't be interpreted as token data.

> Can you please elaborate? How does attacker "modify the output of the decryption"? If attacker don't have to right decryption key, the decrypted output will be garbage and won't be interpreted as token data.

An attacker modifies the output of the decryption by changing bytes in the ciphertext. The encryption algorithm does not, by itself, reject this, and as you noted, this muddles some of the output. It is not true that it muddles all the output, however. Specifically, in the cipher mode currently used, modified bytes in the ciphertext will affect one block of output. If any significant amount of data is stored in the cache, this can allow strategic corruption of only a portion of the encrypted message, leaking information about the encrypted data or compromising client functionality.

For some examples of attacks on similar systems, I recommend reading these papers:

<http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2002/EUROCRYPT/2850/2850.pdf> (the Vaudenay paper - a really good introduction)

<http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/033.pdf> (an attack on PGP's particular use of CFB)

<http://static.usenix.org/event/woot10/tech/full_papers/Rizzo.pdf> (the SSL oracle paper I mentioned above)

For further reading, I recommend Cryptography Engineering, by Ferguson, Schneier and Kohno.

If any significant amount of data is stored in the cache, this can allow strategic corruption of only a portion of the encrypted message, leaking information about the encrypted data or compromising client functionality.
For some examples of attacks on similar systems, I recommend reading these papers:
http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2002/EUROCRYPT/2850/2850.pdf (the Vaudenay paper - a really good introduction)
http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/033.pdf (an attack on PGP's particular use of CFB)
http://static.usenix.org/event/woot10/tech/full\_papers/Rizzo.pdf (the SSL oracle paper I mentioned above)
For further reading, I recommend Cryptography Engineering, by Ferguson, Schneier and Kohno.

Updated impact description:

Title: Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature

Reporter: Paul McMillan (Nebula)

Products: python-keystoneclient

Affects: Grizzly

Description:

Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the signing/encryption security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache\_servers) and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache\_security\_strategy are affected.

Patch looks quite good, similar code to what I am implementing in oslo-incubator, with some minor differences.

I wonder if we want to make it possible to interchange it so that we can consolidate later ?

Some observations:

- I would use HKDF (exapand) from RFC 5869 for the key derivation, insted of just a plain HMAC, as that function has properties that are desirable (I have an implementation available if we want that I have implemented for message signing and can contribute it).

- On the ciphers/hash sides, I think SHA256 would be sufficient, also I would find AES 128 in CBC (as we do not need a stream cipher here) mode wiith random IV prefereable, given AES-128 is faster and also seem has (relatively) less weaknesses than AES-256

- Returning a CACHE\_KEY as derivation from the secret is not necessary, you could as well just return the random IV as the kay as it is already exposed in the data anyway. There is no reason to use a piece of a HMAC output signature as a key that I can see, and I rather not publish any key material, derived or not.

None of these remarks are critical, I think all security properties that we want from this change are fullfilled with the current approach as well.

Some responses to Simo:

- HKDF is fine, but I believe that the approach taken in this patch is also fine. This approach has the benefit of being easier to implement / understand.

- This patch uses AES-128-CBC already. It uses SHA-384 per NIST's recommendation on key derivation. This is needed to produce 3 128 bit keys.

- I'm a little confused on your concerns about returning the cache key. Reusing the IV for a different purpose seems like a bad idea.

Some remarks:

- HKDF would allow you to use SHA256 and obtain up to 10 blocks of material good for keys. Plus it allows key derivation with arbitrary salt (if you use extraction which is not needed) and arbitrary additional info if you need to make the key derivation unique (equivalent to using a serialzied tokena s you do here I guess).

But the reason I suggest it is that it is a true and tested Key Derivation Function while HMAC technically is not, and taking shortcuts tend to have undesirable consequences in the long run. Although I am not concerned in this case.

- AES 128 true, the original code mentioned AES256 and it stuck, however both the old and the new code use MODE\_CFB not MODE\_CBC

- Ignore the IV part you can't look it up so it is not suitable as a memcahce key indeed, pity that, could have saved some space too :) I am still somewhat uncomfortable using a key derived from a secret as a public handle, but it is probably ok.

- If you would like to update the patch to include HKDF, I wouldn't object.

- This patch does use AES-128-CBC. I promise! Go check again :-) I worked with Paul on creating a padding scheme to make CBC possible here. Note the line: AES.new(key, AES.MODE\_CBC, iv)

- If you have an alternate suggestion here, I'm open to it. As it is, I can't think of an attack vector with the current code.

I am sorry Bryan,

apparently when I re-checked about the mode I looked at the first patch in this bug, which used MODE\_CFB.

I just checked the last patch does use MODE\_CBC, so all fine there.

For HKDF here is my current WIP implementation:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/28471/>

Look into openstack/common/cryptoutils.py there is a class called HKDF, it can be very easily extracted and reused for this bug.

I do not see attack vectors with the current code either. I checked that signed/encrypted blobs could not be swapped for example, but if I understand correctly the full token is used to derive the keys so there should be no way to swap blobs and have authentication pass.

In theory there is a 1 in a 2^64 chance (I think, probably lower) that 2 tokens will generate the same cache\_key, but I do not see how that could be practically used in any way.

> line 895: suggest use "not ..." rather than "is None"

I'm deliberately using None rather than accepting 0, [], '', etc. because the documentation specifies the way to skip the security strategy is to omit the key. I don't think that an empty string is an acceptable way to specify "no security", and I want this code to fail loudly if it is improperly configured.

> line 860: Not sure what "This" is referring to, is it the memcache\_crypt.unprotect\_data function or the \_cache\_get function?

Good point, I'll clarify the point that this is a reminder to the reader that unprotect\_data can return None and is not always a json value.

> line 864: no need to include exception string because LOG.exception will print it out.

Good point, I'll fix that.

> line 870: suggest use "not serialized rather than "is None"

This was an abundance of caution about parsing unexpected data. There should be no paths where serialized is not one of None or a valid parsable json, and I'd prefered to have a json decode failure (which makes it obvious that data like 0, '', (), etc. is unexpected) rather than silently returning None. That said, I'm not particularly tied to this use, if you don't buy the argument.

> line 875: comment doesn't make sense since would have returned at 871 if serialized is None.

On the contrary, this is entirely the point. At this point in the code, we have returned if serialized was None (indicating a cache miss or other error), and we know we should be holding a json decodable string. What we know is that the string is NOT the value 'null' which deserializes to None. This comment is asserting that we have not made the common cache/serialization mistake of not differentiating between a stored serialized value of None and a cache miss. This is why we can safely do the "data, expires = cached" expansion a couple lines down.

(note that I'm not wild about the way this works, but I'm fixing the crypto here, not rewriting the caching middleware)

In response to Simo Sorce:

A few notes about this:

We do need to obscure the key as well as the value here. The cache key is usable as an authentication token in other parts of the stack. Because we are doing this, it is inappropriate to talk about salting it, since if we did that we would be unable to look up any values. Furthermore, because this is a caching layer, we don't want to be doing extra work if we can avoid it, which is why I didn't use more than one round of hashing in the KDF.

I do not believe HKDF is appropriate here. Unlike many other uses of KDFs, the input keying material is expected to be of good quality to begin with. People should not be using a password or similar for generating this secret key, and this key is not derived from some other source an attacker may know something about. Furthermore, we do not need 10 blocks of key material, we need exactly 3. Additionally, it is inappropriate to salt these values because that would make it impossible to look up cached material. If you read the SP800-108 document closely, you'll notice that we're basically using one round of the approved KDF (we could prepend a 1 to the hashed value if you want to be pedantic).

However, as you've observed, if the secret material doesn't have enough entropy, this construction breaks down. I've conservatively added a requirement that the secret be at least 48 bytes long, which should reinforce the security of the construct.

Paul,

just a point, on HKDF, I was recommending to use just expand, and not the extract phase of HKDF, so no salt would be required (and technically you can avoid the salt on the extract phase too, the RFC recommends it but says it is not critical.

I am not sure you really need 384 bits for the secret, but won't hurt.

I did not know the cache key was used as an authentication token elsewhere though, can you elaborate that? It's worrying.

Looks like the patch could still use a few rounds of discussion, so we'll wait a bit more before calling keystone core to formally pre-approve it.

Maybe we could make a "security release" of the python keystoneclient addressing the two vulnerabilities in progress.

I don't think the 'ignore-expires' parameter makes sense: if the value in the caches is expired, either from a memcache or a reading of the timestamp on the underlying token, it should be considered invalid. Passing a parameter to somehow modify this seems wrong: we can and should be draconian on this. Why was this added?

Note that there is a more serious CVE with a fix already, and I think this one conflicts with that fix. Please rebase this on top of the change for [https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/+bug/1179615](https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/%2Bbug/1179615) keeping the message signatures in the patch for putting into the cache with the expiration time exposed.

Minor nit: line 192 breaks the pattern of the comment block when splitting over multiple lines, looks like an stray return snuck in.

Could we have a patch rebased on the proposed patch mentioned in comment 27 ?

I'd like to include that fix in a future python-keystoneclient security release.

That snippet looks like [bug 1185231](/bugs/1185231) (testrepository) but if tox on its own is succeeding then unit tests on the Jenkins slaves should be similarly fine (they all run under tox).

Fix memcache encryption middleware

This fixes lp1175367 and lp1175368 by redesigning the memcache crypt

    middleware to not do dangerous things. It is forward compatible, but

    will invalidate any existing ephemeral encrypted or signed memcache

    entries.

# [OSSA 2013-017] Memcache signing middleware improperly implemented (CVE-2013-2167)

Bug #1175368 reported by
[Paul McMillan](https://launchpad.net/~paul-mcmillan)
on 2013-05-01

### Bug Description

The memcache signing middleware in python-keystoneclient is improperly implemented, such that it does not provide the advertised data integrity features. An attacker with access to the memcache instance used as a cache could insert false or changed data which would be silently accepted by the client.

<https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/memcache_crypt.py>

When the 'MAC' security strategy is enabled, the middleware falls through to silently trusting data which is missing the "MAC\_MARKER" prefix. When this mode is enabled, the middleware should require all data to be signed, and raise an error when encountering unsigned or incorrectly signed data.

Furthermore, the construction of the MAC:

h(data || token)

is improper, accepting attacker generated signatures with trivial effort since it involves no data which is not available to an attacker.

Instead, it should use the standard HMAC construction:

HMAC (K,m) = H ((K ⊕ opad) ∥ H ((K ⊕ ipad) ∥ m))

where K is a secret key, m is the message, and opad and ipad are standard constants.

The secret key should be produced using an approved key derivation function which differs from the key used when the 'ENCRYPTION' security strategy is in use. More details on appropriate functions are available in NIST Special Publication 800-108.

As currently written, this feature provides no security benefits whatsoever. I will be proposing a patch later today to fix the issues outlined above. I plan to fix this issue in a forwards-compatible way, with the side effect of invalidating existing ephemeral cache values for users who enabled this feature. This should have a CVE. I'm ok with marking this bug as public given the minimal potential for exploitation (an attacker needs access to the memcache instance, which should never happen in a proper deployment) and the assumed low usage rate of this feature.

Subject: [OSSA 2013-017] Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption
 feature (CVE-2013-2166, CVE-2013-2167)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-017
CVE: CVE-2013-2166, CVE-2013-2167
Date: June 19, 2013
Title: Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature
Reporter: Paul McMillan (Nebula)
Products: python-keystoneclient
Affects: version 0.2.3 to 0.2.5

Description:
Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation
of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An
attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a
man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially
bypass the encryption (CVE-2013-2166) or signing (CVE-2013-2167)
security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of
memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers)
and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache_security_strategy are affected.

python-keystoneclient fix (will be included in upcoming 0.2.6 release):
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/33661>
