Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-2166:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The memcache encryption middleware in python-keystoneclient uses raw AES encryption without authentication.
- The decryption process relies on an optional prefix to decide whether to decrypt data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of data integrity:** Raw AES encryption doesn't provide data integrity. An attacker can modify the ciphertext, leading to potentially predictable changes in the decrypted text.
- **Missing authentication:** The system doesn't verify the integrity of the encrypted data through a signature or MAC before decrypting.
- **Insecure prefix handling:** The optional prefix for decryption enables attackers to inject arbitrary data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data corruption:** An attacker can modify the ciphertext, leading to corrupted values being decoded by the client, potentially causing malfunctions or providing incorrect data.
- **Data manipulation:** Attackers can inject arbitrary data by omitting the prefix, which the client trusts, allowing them to potentially bypass security controls and insert malicious data.
- **Information leakage:** An attacker may be able to decode some or all of the encrypted message through trial and error or by observing system behavior after ciphertext modification.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct access to memcache:** An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend can insert malicious data.
- **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker in a MitM position can intercept and modify the ciphertext.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Direct write access to the memcache backend, or the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
- Knowledge of the memcache key and the ability to modify data within the memcache instance.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects python-keystoneclient versions 0.2.3 through 0.2.5 when memcache caching is enabled with either the "ENCRYPT" or "MAC" security strategy.
- The issue was introduced in the Grizzly release of OpenStack.
- The fix involves properly signing the encrypted blob before storing it, verifying the integrity of the signature before decryption, and ensuring that keys are derived differently for different security strategies.
- The fix invalidates existing ephemeral encrypted or signed memcache entries.
