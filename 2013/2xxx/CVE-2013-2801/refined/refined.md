Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-2801:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. The PI Interface for IEEE C37.118 could read from an invalid memory address when processing C37.118 configuration packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The software improperly handles C37.118 configuration packets, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could shut down the PI Interface for IEEE C37.118 instance, resulting in a data gap for PI points associated with it. This could impact the availability of critical data related to synchro-phasor measurements.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. The attack vector involves sending maliciously crafted C37.118 configuration packets to the PI Interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the PI Interface. The technical skill required to exploit this vulnerability is considered low.

**Additional notes:**
- The advisory also mentions a similar vulnerability, CVE-2013-2800, which can lead to memory corruption or exhaustion, with a similar impact. Both CVEs have the same CVSS base score and vector string.
- The vendor, OSIsoft, has released a software update (Version 1.0.6.158 or later) to address these vulnerabilities.
- The advisory recommends defensive measures such as minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and employing VPNs for remote access, as well as performing proper impact analysis and risk assessment.
