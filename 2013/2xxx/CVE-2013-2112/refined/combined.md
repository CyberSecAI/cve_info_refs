Package        : subversion
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1968 CVE-2013-2112
Debian Bug     : 711033

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control
system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2013-1968

    Subversion repositories with the FSFS repository data store format
    can be corrupted by newline characters in filenames. A remote
    attacker with a malicious client could use this flaw to disrupt the
    service for other users using that repository.

CVE-2013-2112

    Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when an incoming TCP
    connection is closed early in the connection process. A remote
    attacker can cause svnserve to exit and thus deny service to users
    of the server.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.12dfsg-7.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.17dfsg-4+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

=== Content from subversion.apache.org_11670257_20250126_111544.html ===
 mod\_dav\_svn is vunerable to a remotely triggerable segfault DoS vulnerability
when SVNListParentPath is on.
Summary:
========
Subversion's mod\_dav\_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash when it
receives an OPTIONS request against the server root and Subversion is
configured to handle the server root and SVNListParentPath is on.
This can lead to a DoS. There are no known instances of this
problem being exploited in the wild, but the details of how to exploit
it have been disclosed on the Subversion development mailing list.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.3.0 through 1.7.14 (inclusive)
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.8.0 through 1.8.5 (inclusive)
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.15 (not publicly released)
Subversion 1.7.16
Subversion 1.8.6-1.8.7 (not publicly released)
Subversion 1.8.8
svnserve (any version) is not vulnerable
Details:
========
When Subversion is configured on the root path of the server and the
SVNListParentPath directive is set to on then the following commands
will trigger a segfault:
svn list http://svn.example.com/
svn lock http://svn.example.com/
This occurs because when mod\_dav\_svn attempts to calculate the parent
path of the request is ends up setting a NULL pointer (since there can be
no parent of the server root URI), which is later assumed to be valid memory.
When Subversion is configured on any Location other than "/" (e.g. "/svn")
then the problem does not occur since the parent of the path can be
calculated and stored in memory.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 4.3
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P
We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. Repositories which
allow for anonymous reads will be vulnerable without authentication.
However, we believe the required configuration is relatively rare. Most
systems are not hosting Subversion on the root path of the server and
only a small number of those have the SVNListParentPath configuration on.
A remote attacker may be able to crash a Subversion server. Many Apache
servers will respawn the listener processes, but a determined attacker
will be able to crash these processes as they appear, denying service to
legitimate users. Servers using threaded MPMs will close the connection
on other clients being served by the same process that services the
OPTIONS request from the attacker. In either case there is an increased
processing impact of restarting a process and the cost of per process
caches being lost.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.8.8. Users of
Subversion 1.7.x or 1.8.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
included patch.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
Administrators that wish to protect against this without patching
immediately can apply the following configuration to their httpd.conf
file:
[[[
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all

]]]
CAUTION: The above configuration should only be used when Subversion is
enabled on the root location in a parent path configuration. For example the
following is the minimal configuration that matches this case:
[[

DAV svn
SVNParentPath /var/svn

]]
In this case it will not block any useful requests and can be used without
concern that it will break anything. If Subversion is running on any other
path or is not being used in a parent path configuration this configuration
should not be applied as these configurations are not vulnerable and it can
break functionality of Subversion or other applications being served from the
same httpd.

 Subversion svnserve servers up to 1.7.9 (inclusive) are vulnerable
to a remotely triggerable DoS vulnerability.
Summary:
========
Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when an incoming TCP connection
is closed early in the connection process.
This can lead to disruption for users of the server.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion servers through 1.7.9 (inclusive).
Subversion servers through 1.6.21 (inclusive).
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.10
Subversion 1.6.23
Subversion 1.8.0
mod\_dav\_svn (any version) is not vulnerable.
Details:
========
During a connection attempt svnserve improperly treats aborted connections
as critical errors, prints an error message and exits. The error message
will look like this:
svnserve: E000053: Can't accept client connection: Software caused connection abort
The problem is that svnserve is not properly checking for aborted connection
error returns from the accept() call.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 7.8
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C
We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. An exploit exists and
has been tested to work against this vulnerability. We do not believe the
exploit is being actively used in the wild at this time.
A remote attacker can cause svnserve to exit and thus deny service to users
of the server. The attack does not require that the attacker authenticate.
Due to differences in implementations of their TCP stacks some operating
systems may be more or less prone to this behavior. FreeBSD and OpenBSD are
known to be particularly vulnerable. We believe that this is still possible
with all operating systems though.
svnserve when used in inetd, tunnel (svn+ssh), and Win32 service modes is
not vulnerable as they do not use the accept() call in question.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.7.10 or 1.6.23.
Users who are unable to upgrade may apply the included patches.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
Using svnserve in inetd, tunnel or Win32 service modes can be used to
mitigate this problem. There are no known methods to mitigate this attack
in daemon mode.

## Details

Alexander Klink discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module for

Apache did not properly handle a large number of properties. A remote

authenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause memory consumption,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1845](/security/CVE-2013-1845))

Ben Reser discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module for

Apache did not properly handle certain LOCKs. A remote authenticated

attacker could use this flaw to cause Subversion to crash, leading to a

denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1846](/security/CVE-2013-1846))

Philip Martin and Ben Reser discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn

module for Apache did not properly handle certain LOCKs. A remote

attacker could use this flaw to cause Subversion to crash, leading to a

denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1847](/security/CVE-2013-1847))

It was discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module for Apache did not

properly handle certain PROPFIND requests. A remote attacker could use this

flaw to cause Subversion to crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2013-1849](/security/CVE-2013-1849))

Greg McMullin, Stefan Fuhrmann, Philip Martin, and Ben Reser discovered

that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module for Apache did not properly handle

certain log REPORT requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause

Subversion to crash, leading to a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu 13.04. ([CVE-2013-1884](/security/CVE-2013-1884))

 Subversion FSFS repositories can be corrupted by newline characters in
filenames
Summary:
========
If a filename which contains a newline character (ASCII 0x0a) is
committed to a repository using the FSFS format, the resulting
revision is corrupt.
This can lead to disruption for users of the repository.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion servers through 1.7.9 (inclusive).
Subversion servers through 1.6.21 (inclusive).
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.10
Subversion 1.6.23
Subversion 1.8.0
Details:
========
The FSFS repository stores data for each revision in a revision file.
Filename data in the revision file is stored on a line-per-line basis.
If a filename itself contains a newline character (ASCII 0x0a), this
newline is incorrectly treated as a line separator, rather than as
part of the filename.
Affected revisions cannot be read correctly and cause some Subversion
commands to fail. Known symptoms of the problem include:
1) 'svnadmin verify' is known to fail with errors beginning with:
"svnadmin: E160013: File not found:"
2) 'svnsync' fails to replicate the revision.
Apache Subversion clients have always rejected such filenames, so this
issue cannot be triggered with stock Subversion clients. It could,
however, be triggered by custom malicious Subversion clients or by
third-party client implementations.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 4.9
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:P
We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. Configurations which
allow anonymous write access to the repository will be vulnerable to this
without authentication.
A remote authenticated attacker with commit access may be able to corrupt
repositories on a Subversion server and cause disruption for other users.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.7.10 or 1.6.23.
Users who are unable to upgrade may apply the included patches.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
A workaround is to install the control-chars.py hook script as the
pre-commit hook, which will prevent bad filenames from entering the
repository. The script is available at this URL:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/tools/hook-scripts/control-chars.py

## Synopsis

Moderate: subversion security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0255)

## Topic

Updated subversion packages that fix three security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Subversion (SVN) is a concurrent version control system which enables one
or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a hierarchy of
files and directories while keeping a history of all changes. The
mod\_dav\_svn module is used with the Apache HTTP Server to allow access to
Subversion repositories via HTTP.

A flaw was found in the way the mod\_dav\_svn module handled OPTIONS
requests. A remote attacker with read access to an SVN repository served
via HTTP could use this flaw to cause the httpd process that handled such a
request to crash. (CVE-2014-0032)

A flaw was found in the way Subversion handled file names with newline
characters when the FSFS repository format was used. An attacker with
commit access to an SVN repository could corrupt a revision by committing a
specially crafted file. (CVE-2013-1968)

A flaw was found in the way the svnserve tool of Subversion handled remote
client network connections. An attacker with read access to an SVN
repository served via svnserve could use this flaw to cause the svnserve
daemon to exit, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2013-2112)

All subversion users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, for the update to take effect, you must restart the httpd
daemon, if you are using mod\_dav\_svn, and the svnserve daemon, if you are
serving Subversion repositories via the svn:// protocol.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>
