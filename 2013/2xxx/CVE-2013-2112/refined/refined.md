  "CVE-2013-2112": {
    "description": "Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when an incoming TCP connection is closed early in the connection process. A remote attacker can cause svnserve to exit and thus deny service to users of the server.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `svnserve` tool of Subversion improperly handles aborted TCP connections, treating them as critical errors and causing the process to terminate.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of early-closed TCP connections.",
          "Lack of proper checks for aborted connection error returns from the accept() call."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause `svnserve` to exit, leading to denial of service for users of the Subversion server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote network connection to the `svnserve` service.",
          "Sending an early-closed TCP connection to trigger the vulnerability."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the server where `svnserve` is running. Authentication is not required. No special capabilities are needed other than the ability to create and close a TCP connection abruptly.  Some operating systems, like FreeBSD and OpenBSD, may be more prone to this issue than others.",
