Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how EC-CUBE handles URLs, specifically in the `adminAuthorization()` function within `SC_Helper_Session.php`.  The original code uses `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` to check if a user is accessing a management page, which can be unreliable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to properly restrict access to the administrative interface. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to bypass authentication checks and potentially access sensitive administrative functions.
*   **Reliance on `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']`:**  The code's reliance on `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` for path matching is insecure. This variable can be manipulated in certain environments, leading to authentication bypass.
*   **Inadequate Path Matching:** The original code used regular expressions to check if the requested URL matches the admin directory. This approach is error-prone and was found to be insufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can access the administrative interface, bypassing the intended login mechanism.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:**  Successful access to the admin panel could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as data theft, manipulation, or system compromise, although not explicitly stated in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network. The attacker does not need to have an existing account or be logged in.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attack exploits the way EC-CUBE processes URLs. Specifically, manipulation of the `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` variable could lead to the bypass of access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the EC-CUBE application over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  No prior authentication is needed. The attacker can directly target the vulnerable administrative interface.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and how to exploit it.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of EC-CUBE from 2.11.0 up to 2.12.3 (including different language and patch versions).
*   The fix involves a change to the `adminAuthorization()` function in `/data/class/helper/SC_Helper_Session.php`. The new logic uses `realpath()` and `array_diff_assoc()` to more reliably determine if the user is accessing an admin page and avoids using the insecure `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` variable directly.
