### Content relates to CVE-2013-2193
The provided content is a security advisory for CVE-2013-2193, which describes a man-in-the-middle vulnerability in Apache HBase.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Apache HBase RPC protocol, intended for bidirectional authentication, allows a malicious server or network attacker to unilaterally disable authentication checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unilateral disabling of authentication checks in the HBase RPC protocol.
    - Potential reduction in the configured quality of protection of RPC traffic.
    - Privilege escalation if authentication credentials are passed over RPC.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Interception of RPC traffic from clients to Region Servers by a malicious user.
    - Potential for privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A malicious server or network attacker with the ability to run tasks or containers on a cluster.
    - The attacker exploits the ability to disable authentication checks within the HBase RPC protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Access to run tasks or containers on a cluster where HBase is co-located with Hadoop MapReduce or Hadoop YARN.
    - Ability to act as a malicious server or network attacker capable of manipulating network communications.
