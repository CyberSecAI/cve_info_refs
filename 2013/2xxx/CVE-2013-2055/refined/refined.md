The provided content includes information about CVE-2013-2055.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to Apache Wicket's failure to properly process HTML templates, leading to the possibility of delivering the raw/non-processed template content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability is an information disclosure issue.  Wicket templates usually have special tags (e.g., `<wicket:panel>`) that are used by the framework to render dynamic content. Normally, content outside these tags is ignored but this vulnerability allows an attacker to access this usually ignored content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can access sensitive information present in the HTML templates that is normally ignored during rendering. This could include sensitive data before or after the Wicket Panel/Border markup.

**Attack vectors:**
By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can force Wicket to deliver the unprocessed HTML templates.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to send requests to the affected Wicket application to trigger the vulnerability. No special network position is mentioned. The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the request in a way that triggers the raw template response.
