Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2038:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two separate issues within the `gpsd` daemon:

1.  **NMEA driver vulnerability:** A malformed NMEA packet, specifically an incomplete GGA message without a trailing carriage return and newline, could cause `gpsd` to crash. This usually was discarded, but in rare cases could trigger a core dump.
2.  **AIS driver vulnerability:** The un-armoring logic in the AIS driver lacked proper bounds checking. This could theoretically allow an attacker to craft an overlong armored packet to overrun the binary-packet buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **NMEA driver:** Improper handling of malformed input, specifically incomplete NMEA GGA messages, which could lead to a crash.
2.  **AIS driver:** Missing bounds checking in the un-armoring logic, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Both vulnerabilities could lead to a crash of the `gpsd` daemon, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not confirmed, the Ubuntu security notice suggests that the buffer overflow in the AIS driver *could* potentially allow for arbitrary code execution. However, the original developer of `gpsd` believes that the AIS buffer overflow may not be exploitable, due to other code properties (maximum length of the AIVDM ASCII packet buffer).

**Attack vectors:**

*   **NMEA driver:** An attacker could send specially crafted malformed NMEA packets to the `gpsd` daemon. This could involve a compromised GPS device or a crafted data stream if directly connected to a GPS device.
*   **AIS driver:** An attacker could send specially crafted overlong AIVDM ASCII packets to the `gpsd` daemon through a compromised data source.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **NMEA driver:** The attacker would need the ability to send data to the `gpsd` daemon. This could be achieved by manipulating the data stream from a GPS device, or by sending data to the daemon through a communication channel (if exposed).
*   **AIS driver:** The attacker would need the ability to send data to the `gpsd` daemon, specifically overlong crafted AIVDM ASCII packets.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `gpsd` daemon needs root privileges to initialize, but drops them before the vulnerabilities can be triggered. Thus, there is no privilege escalation associated with this vulnerability.
*   The fix for the NMEA driver issue was commit `dd9c3c2830cb8f8fd8491ce68c82698dc5538f50`, while the fix for the AIS driver was commit `08edc49d8f63c75bfdfb480b083b0d960310f94f`.
*   The AIS driver fix was mainly a preventative measure.
