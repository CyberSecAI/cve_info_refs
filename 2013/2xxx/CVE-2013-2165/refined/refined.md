### CVE-2013-2165

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insecure deserialization in RichFaces ResourceBuilderImpl. This allows a remote attacker to trigger the execution of deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted deserialization of user-provided data. This allows attackers to control which classes are instantiated during deserialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Depending on the deserialization logic of the classes deployed, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Arbitrary file writes: Attackers may be able to write arbitrary files on the application server, depending on the deployed classes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attacker can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted input that is processed by RichFaces ResourceBuilderImpl's deserialization mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable server.
