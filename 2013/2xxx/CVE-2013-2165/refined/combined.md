## Synopsis

Critical: richfaces security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1042)

## Topic

Updated richfaces packages that fix one security issue are now available
for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

RichFaces is an open source framework that adds Ajax capability into
existing JavaServer Faces (JSF) applications.

A flaw was found in the way RichFaces ResourceBuilderImpl handled
deserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the
execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed
on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending
on the deserialization logic of these classes. (CVE-2013-2165)

The fix for this issue introduces a whitelist to limit classes that can be
deserialized by RichFaces.

If you require to whitelist a class that is not already listed, for
example, a custom class, you can achieve this by following one of these
methods:

Method 1: Implementing the SerializableResource interface.
In RichFaces 3, this is defined at
org.ajax4jsf.resource.SerializableResource and in RichFaces 4/5, at
org.richfaces.resource.SerializableResource.

Method 2: Adding the class to the resource-serialization.properties file
(a default properties file is provided once this update is applied).
To do this you can extend the framework provided properties file that is
available under org.ajax4jsf.resource in RichFaces 3 and
org.richfaces.resource in RichFaces 4/5. The modified properties file has
to be copied into the classpath of your deployment under the
version-specific packages.

Where possible, it is recommended that Method 1 be followed.

Red Hat would like to thank Takeshi Terada (Mitsui Bussan Secure
Directions, Inc.) for reporting this issue.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
and configuration files).

All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Critical: richfaces security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1043)

## Topic

Updated richfaces packages that fix one security issue are now available
for Red Hat JBoss Web Platform 5.2.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5,
and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

RichFaces is an open source framework that adds Ajax capability into
existing JavaServer Faces (JSF) applications.

A flaw was found in the way RichFaces ResourceBuilderImpl handled
deserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the
execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed
on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending
on the deserialization logic of these classes. (CVE-2013-2165)

The fix for this issue introduces a whitelist to limit classes that can be
deserialized by RichFaces.

If you require to whitelist a class that is not already listed, for
example, a custom class, you can achieve this by following one of these
methods:

Method 1: Implementing the SerializableResource interface.
In RichFaces 3, this is defined at
org.ajax4jsf.resource.SerializableResource and in RichFaces 4/5, at
org.richfaces.resource.SerializableResource.

Method 2: Adding the class to the resource-serialization.properties file
(a default properties file is provided once this update is applied).
To do this you can extend the framework provided properties file that is
available under org.ajax4jsf.resource in RichFaces 3 and
org.richfaces.resource in RichFaces 4/5. The modified properties file has
to be copied into the classpath of your deployment under the
version-specific packages.

Where possible, it is recommended that Method 1 be followed.

Red Hat would like to thank Takeshi Terada (Mitsui Bussan Secure
Directions, Inc.) for reporting this issue.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
Web Platform installation (including all applications and configuration
files).

All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. The JBoss
server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# JVN#38787103 JBoss RichFaces vulnerable to remote code execution

## Overview

JBoss RichFaces contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to an issue with deserialization.

## Products Affected

RichFaces applications that are created using the following versions are affected:

* RichFaces 5.x
* RichFaces 4.x
* RichFaces 3.x

## Description

JBoss RichFaces is a framework for integrating Ajax into web applications. JBoss RichFaces applications contain a deserialization interface where end users may provide input. This interface may deserialize untrusted data, which may lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Impact

When specially crafted input is processed, arbitrary files may be written or arbitrary code may be executed on the application server.

## Solution

**Apply a patch**
Apply the appropriate patch according to the information provided by the developer.

# RichFaces exploitation toolkit

---

*From*: Red Timmy Security <publications () redtimmy com>

*Date*: Fri, 13 Mar 2020 21:29:47 +0100

```

Hi,

```
The RichFaces library has been vulnerable to many Java deserialization
and EL injection vulnerabilities. This infamous library is included with
many JSF web applications for providing advanced UI elements beyond the
(very limited) set that is built-in with the framework. Therefore, many
websites using JSF are vulnerable to exploitation.
```

```
Until now, the vulnerabilities had to be exploited manually. Richsploit
is a toolkit that can exploit multiple versions of RichFaces:
```

RichFaces 3
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.3   CVE-2013-2165
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.4   CVE-2018-12533
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.4   CVE-2018-14667
RichFaces 4
4.0.0 ≤ 4.3.2   CVE-2013-2165
4.0.0 ≤ 4.5.4   CVE-2015-0279
4.5.3 ≤ 4.5.17  CVE-2018-12532

```
For more information, please read our blog post at:
<https://www.redtimmy.com/java-hacking/richsploit-one-tool-to-exploit-all-versions-of-richfaces-ever-released/>
```

```
The tool can be downloaded from GitHub:

```

Red Timmy Security

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1044)

## Topic

Updated jboss-seam2 packages that fix one security issue are now available
for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The JBoss Seam 2 framework is an application framework for building web
applications in Java. The RichFaces component is an open source framework
that adds Ajax capability into existing JavaServer Faces (JSF)
applications.

A flaw was found in the way RichFaces ResourceBuilderImpl handled
deserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the
execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed
on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending
on the deserialization logic of these classes. (CVE-2013-2165)

The fix for this issue introduces a whitelist to limit classes that can be
deserialized by RichFaces.

If you require to whitelist a class that is not already listed, for
example, a custom class, you can achieve this by following one of these
methods:

Method 1: Implementing the SerializableResource interface.
In RichFaces 3, this is defined at
org.ajax4jsf.resource.SerializableResource and in RichFaces 4/5, at
org.richfaces.resource.SerializableResource.

Method 2: Adding the class to the resource-serialization.properties file
(a default properties file is provided once this update is applied).
To do this you can extend the framework provided properties file that is
available under org.ajax4jsf.resource in RichFaces 3 and
org.richfaces.resource in RichFaces 4/5. The modified properties file has
to be copied into the classpath of your deployment under the
version-specific packages.

Where possible, it is recommended that Method 1 be followed.

Red Hat would like to thank Takeshi Terada (Mitsui Bussan Secure
Directions, Inc.) for reporting this issue.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
and configuration files).

All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 on
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# Vulnerabilities:CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Overview

Last Updated:Apr 5, 2022

Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan

A list of software weakness types to provide a common language for identifying the type of vulnerability

>> [JAPANESE](https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/vuln/scap/cwe.html)

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)[(\*1)](#L1) aims to provide a common base to identify the type of software weakness (vulnerability).

 Leading the effort with support from the U.S. government, MITRE[(\*2)](#L2) had been working on a specification since 1999 and published the first draft in March 2006. [More than 40 vendors and research entities](http://cwe.mitre.org/community/index.html) have joined hands to improve and expand the specification since then and the version 1.0 of CWE was published on September 9, 2008.

 CWE gives a hierarchically structured list of weakness types to help identifying software vulnerabilities that come in a wide variety, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and buffer overflow. The use of CWE will enable software developers and security experts to:

1. Have a common language to discuss software vulnerability in architecture, design and code.
2. Use as a standard measuring rule for security tools, such as a vulnerability scanning tool, to enhance software security.
3. Use as a common foundation to understand, mitigate and prevent vulnerability.

CWE has been adopted by NIST[(\*3)](#L3) for NVD[(\*4)](#L4), OWASP[(\*5)](#L5) for Top Ten Project[(\*6)](#L6) and other security vendors.

 This overview is based on CWE Version 1.5, released by MITRE. For more information, please refer to [MITRE CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html).

## 1.CWE Structure

CWE organizes a wide variety of weakness types in a hierarchical structure and gives a unique identifier (CWE-ID) to each type. The weakness types at higher levels in the structure gives a more abstract and broader concept, while those at deeper level gives a more concrete concept or represent an actual CWE entity.

There are four structural classifications in CWE: View, Category, Weakness and Compound Element. Currently, 22 weakness types are classified as View, 105 as Category, 638 as Weakness and 12 as Compound Element. In total, 777 CWE entries are defined and organized in the list.

### (1)View

Each View entry represents a perspective with which one may use CWE and organizes weakness types from the perspective. For example, NIST has handpicked 19 weakness types from CWE based on the vulnerabilities published on NVD and lists them on its Web site ([CWE Cross Section Mapped into by NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories#cwes)). The View that consists of those 19 weakness types is being given the CWE-ID of CWE-635, Weaknesses Used by NVD.

 Likewise, CWE-699 is the View organized from the perspective of developers, CWE-1000 from that of researchers, CWE-658 from that of C and CWE-660 from that of Java.

### (2)Category

Each Category entry, given a âgroupingâ capability, represents a collection of weakness types that share a common characteristic.

For instance, CWE-310 is a group of weakness types with cryptographic issues and CWE-355 with user interface issues.

### (3)Weakness

Each Weakness entry represents an actual CWE entity and is subsequently classified using three attributes: Class, Base and Variant.

The Class attribute suggests the most abstract type of weakness of the three. CWE-362, Race Condition, is an example of this type.

The Base attribute suggests a more specific type of weakness that is independent of specific technology or resource. CWE-567, Unsynchronized Access To Shared Data, is an example of this type.

The Variant attribute suggests a specific type of weakness that is dependent of particular resource, technology or context. CWE-488, Data Leak Between Sessions, is an example of this type.

### (4)Compound Element

Each Compound Element entry represents an aggregation of related weakness types with a composite nature and is subsequently classified using two attributes: Composite and Chain.

The Composite attribute suggests a case where a weakness emerges in combination of another weakness. CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery, is an example of this type.

The Chain attribute suggests a case where a weakness results in another weakness. CWE-680, Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow, is an example of this type.

## 2.Elements of CWE

The [CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html) is organized by CWE-ID and each CWE entry is provided with various information. To name a few, the CWE elements include Description, Likelihood of Exploit, Common Consequences, Potential Mitigations, Demonstrative Examples and Observed Example.

 Users could use the CWE List as reference to identity, mitigate and prevent vulnerabilities.

## 3.JVN iPedia declared CWE-Compatible

[JVN iPedia](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/) began to support CWE as a trial on September 10, 2008[(\*7)](#Footnote). IPA had worked on a few remaining requirements to make a CWE compatibility declaration and declared it CWE-Compatible on October 3, 2008.

 The official list of organizations participating in the CWE Compatibility and Effectiveness Program is available on Mitreâs CWE web site.

 <http://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/organizations.html>

 [MyJVN](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/apis/myjvn/) began to support CWE on October 23, 2008[(\*8)](#Footnote).

 The four mandatory requirements â âCWE Searchabilityâ, âCWE Outputâ, âCWE Documentationâ and âMapping Accuracyâ â for phase 1 are fulfilled by the functions illustrated in Table 1.

Table 1. Requirement Correspondence Status of JVN iPedia and MyJVN
| CWE Searchability | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By using the search function in JVN iPedia, the vulnerability countermeasure information database, users are able to conduct a search using CWE identifiers as the keyword. |
| CWE Output | Capability  JVN iPedia   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifiers are displayed in the âReferencesâ section within each vulnerability countermeasure information pages. |
| CWE Output | Capability  MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifier is displayed in the âAdvisory, related informationâ section of the detailed information window of each vulnerability countermeasure information. |
| CWE Documentation | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  This material document will become the documentation necessary to describe and demonstrate CWE, CWE association and methods used to satisfy the compatibility requirements. |
| Mapping Accuracy | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By setting a JVN iPedia ID in the sec:identifier field of JVNDBRSS, which is used to specify the identifier of the security information, and storing the JVN ID and CWE identifier in the sec:reference field, which are used to specify the URL of the related security information, it is possible to demonstrate the correspondence of the JVN iPedia ID with the CWE identifier. |

Figure 1 shows a hierarchical structure of weakness types to be used by JVN iPedia. It is based on [Development View with Abstractions Highlighted](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdf/699_abstraction_colors.pdf), which is a graph that depicts the hierarchical structure of a View organized from the perspective of developers.

 The yellow-colored ones are to be used by JVN iPedia. For the overall hierarchical structure of the CWE List, please refer to [PDFs with Graphical Depictions of CWE (1.5)](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdfs.html).

 IPA will revise the weakness types, analyzing the vulnerabilities published on JVN iPedia, and consider expanding them to include the deeper level of weakness types to support frequently-reported vulnerabilities.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c0)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2013-06-12 08:48:56 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way JBoss RichFaces handled deserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending on the deserialization logic of these classes.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-10 23:45:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.3.0  Via RHSA-2013:1041 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1041.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-10 23:57:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWP 5 for RHEL 6   JBEWP 5 for RHEL 5   JBEWP 5 for RHEL 4  Via RHSA-2013:1043 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1043.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-10 23:57:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 5 for RHEL 6   JBEAP 5 for RHEL 5   JBEAP 5 for RHEL 4  Via RHSA-2013:1042 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1042.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-11 00:18:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0   Red Hat JBoss Web Platform 5.2.0   Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1   Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4.3.0 CP05   Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1   Red Hat JBoss Portal 4.3 CP07   Red Hat JBoss Portal 5.2.2   Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 2.4.2   Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2  Via RHSA-2013:1045 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1045.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-11 00:20:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 4   JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2013:1044 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1044.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c0)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2013-06-12 08:48:56 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way JBoss RichFaces handled deserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending on the deserialization logic of these classes.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-10 23:45:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.3.0  Via RHSA-2013:1041 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1041.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-10 23:57:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWP 5 for RHEL 6   JBEWP 5 for RHEL 5   JBEWP 5 for RHEL 4  Via RHSA-2013:1043 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1043.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-10 23:57:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 5 for RHEL 6   JBEAP 5 for RHEL 5   JBEAP 5 for RHEL 4  Via RHSA-2013:1042 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1042.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-11 00:18:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0   Red Hat JBoss Web Platform 5.2.0   Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1   Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4.3.0 CP05   Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1   Red Hat JBoss Portal 4.3 CP07   Red Hat JBoss Portal 5.2.2   Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 2.4.2   Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2  Via RHSA-2013:1045 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1045.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=973570#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-11 00:20:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 4   JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2013:1044 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1044.html>   ``` |  |
