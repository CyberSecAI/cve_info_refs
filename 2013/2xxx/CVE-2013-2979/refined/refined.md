- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary file download. An attacker can potentially access sensitive files on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via a directory traversal attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests that include directory traversal sequences, such as "../", to the vulnerable component of the software.
