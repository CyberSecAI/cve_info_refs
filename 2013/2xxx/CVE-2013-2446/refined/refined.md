Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2013-2446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2013-2446 is a lack of proper access restrictions on output streams within the CORBA component of OpenJDK. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the CORBA component handles output streams, allowing untrusted code to potentially write to them without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core weakness is the failure to enforce adequate restrictions on the use of CORBA output streams by untrusted Java applets or applications.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could potentially allow for disclosure of sensitive information by enabling unauthorized access to write to the stream.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information. This happens because the lack of proper access restrictions may allow an attacker to write to the output stream.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely via untrusted Java applets or applications.
*   **Network Attack:** An attacker could trigger the vulnerability through network calls to the affected CORBA service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to remotely execute a malicious applet or application or otherwise send crafted network requests to the CORBA service.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability using an unprivileged account.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the CORBA component of OpenJDK.
*   The issue is described as a lack of "output stream access restrictions" in the context of CORBA.
*   The fix involves applying the relevant patches from the Oracle June 2013 Critical Patch Update (CPU) and subsequent updates from other vendors that incorporate the fix from Oracle.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Some sources mention that this is a medium severity vulnerability.
*   Multiple vendors provide fixes for this CVE, including Oracle, Red Hat, HP, and SUSE.
*   The vulnerability primarily affects the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Development Kit (JDK).
*   The fix in Javadoc and documentation for the vulnerability can prevent a frame injection attack.
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in multiple vendors' products with security updates.

This CVE is primarily a vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Development Kit (JDK), where access to CORBA output streams was not properly restricted, potentially leading to information disclosure.
