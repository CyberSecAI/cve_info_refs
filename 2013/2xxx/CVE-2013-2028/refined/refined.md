Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-2028:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the way nginx handles chunked encoding in HTTP requests. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered in the `ngx_http_parse_chunked` function when parsing the chunked size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack. The provided patch shows that the code was missing checks to ensure that the size and length are not negative during parsing of chunked data.
- Lack of input validation: Insufficient validation of chunked size values leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By carefully crafting a malicious chunked request, an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, including return addresses, and potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the nginx worker process.
- Denial of Service: A malformed request could crash the nginx process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable nginx server.
- HTTP chunked encoding: The attack is performed through a crafted chunked transfer encoding in an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable nginx server.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- **Vulnerable Versions:** The vulnerability affects nginx versions 1.3.9 through 1.4.0.
- **Patched Versions:** Fixed in versions 1.5.0 and 1.4.1.
- **Stack Protection Bypass:**  The discussions in the github content show that exploiting this vulnerability on systems with stack canaries requires an additional step of bypassing or bruteforcing the stack canary.
- **Exploit Development:** The github content shows ongoing efforts to develop reliable exploits, including bypassing stack protection and utilizing GOT (Global Offset Table) dereferencing to avoid brute-forcing libc addresses, which is also detailed in some of the comments.
- **Workaround:** A temporary workaround is mentioned that filters chunked requests.
- **Targeted exploitation:** The exploit was specifically developed and tested on platforms such as Kali Linux, RHEL 6.4, Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 13.04 and Debian Squeeze

This content provides more details than the initial CVE description, showcasing not only the technical root cause but also exploit development nuances, including the bypass of stack canaries. It provides practical information on the impact and the mitigation of this vulnerability.
