pty: return EINVAL for TIOCGPTN for BSD ptys
commit ded2f295a36d17838fe97e80d7b6ea83381474f8 upstream.
Commit bbb63c514a3464342967237a51a21ea8f61ab951 (drivers:tty:fix up
ENOIOCTLCMD error handling) changed the default return value from tty
ioctl to be ENOTTY and not EINVAL. This is appropriate.
But in case of TIOCGPTN for the old BSD ptys glibc started failing
because it expects EINVAL to be returned. Only then it continues to
obtain the pts name the other way around.
So fix this case by explicit return of EINVAL in this case.

mxs: uart: fix setting RTS from software
commit a6833214cfc6fa8a7c59426af77794cc190c6cfc upstream.
With the patch "serial: mxs-auart: fix the wrong RTS hardware flow control" the
mainline mxs-uart driver now sets RTSEN only when hardware flow control is
enabled via software. It is not possible any longer to set RTS manually via
software. However, the manual modification is a valid operation.
Regain the possibility to set RTS via software and only set RTSEN when hardware
flow control is explicitly enabled via settermios cflag CRTSCTS.

staging: vt6656: Fix inconsistent structure packing
commit 1ee4c55fc9620451b2a825d793042a7e0775391b upstream.
vt6656 has several headers that use the #pragma pack(1) directive to
enable structure packing, but never disable it. The layout of
structures defined in other headers can then depend on which order the
various headers are included in, breaking the One Definition Rule.
In practice this resulted in crashes on x86\_64 until the order of header
inclusion was changed for some files in commit 11d404cb56ecd ('staging:
vt6656: fix headers and add cfg80211.'). But we need a proper fix that
won't be affected by future changes to the order of inclusion.
This removes the #pragma pack(1) directives and adds \_\_packed to the
structure definitions for which packing appears to have been intended.

8250/16?50: Add support for Broadcom TruManage redirected serial port
commit ebebd49a8eab5e9aa1b1f8f1614ccc3c2120f886 upstream.
Add support for the UART device present in Broadcom TruManage capable
NetXtreme chips (ie: 5761m 5762, and 5725).
This implementation has a hidden transmit FIFO, so running in single-byte
interrupt mode results in too many interrupts. The UART\_CAP\_HFIFO
capability was added to track this. It continues to reload the THR as long
as the THRE and TSRE bits are set in the LSR up to a specified limit (1024
is used here).

xen: Fix stack corruption in xen\_failsafe\_callback for 32bit PVOPS guests.
commit 9174adbee4a9a49d0139f5d71969852b36720809 upstream.
This fixes CVE-2013-0190 / XSA-40
There has been an error on the xen\_failsafe\_callback path for failed
iret, which causes the stack pointer to be wrong when entering the
iret\_exc error path. This can result in the kernel crashing.
In the classic kernel case, the relevant code looked a little like:
popl %eax # Error code from hypervisor
jz 5f
addl $16,%esp
jmp iret\_exc # Hypervisor said iret fault
5: addl $16,%esp
# Hypervisor said segment selector fault
Here, there are two identical addls on either option of a branch which
appears to have been optimised by hoisting it above the jz, and
converting it to an lea, which leaves the flags register unaffected.
In the PVOPS case, the code looks like:
popl\_cfi %eax # Error from the hypervisor
lea 16(%esp),%esp # Add $16 before choosing fault path
CFI\_ADJUST\_CFA\_OFFSET -16
jz 5f
addl $16,%esp # Incorrectly adjust %esp again
jmp iret\_exc
It is possible unprivileged userspace applications to cause this
behaviour, for example by loading an LDT code selector, then changing
the code selector to be not-present. At this point, there is a race
condition where it is possible for the hypervisor to return back to
userspace from an interrupt, fault on its own iret, and inject a
failsafe\_callback into the kernel.
This bug has been present since the introduction of Xen PVOPS support
in commit 5ead97c84 (xen: Core Xen implementation), in 2.6.23.

xen/grant-table: correctly initialize grant table version 1
commit d0b4d64aadb9f4a90669848de9ef3819050a98cd upstream.
Commit 85ff6acb075a484780b3d763fdf41596d8fc0970 (xen/granttable: Grant
tables V2 implementation) changed the GREFS\_PER\_GRANT\_FRAME macro from
a constant to a conditional expression. The expression depends on
grant\_table\_version being appropriately set. Unfortunately, at init
time grant\_table\_version will be 0. The GREFS\_PER\_GRANT\_FRAME
conditional expression checks for "grant\_table\_version == 1", and
therefore returns the number of grant references per frame for v2.
This causes gnttab\_init() to allocate fewer pages for gnttab\_list, as
a frame can old half the number of v2 entries than v1 entries. After
gnttab\_resume() is called, grant\_table\_version is appropriately
set. nr\_init\_grefs will then be miscalculated and gnttab\_free\_count
will hold a value larger than the actual number of free gref entries.
If a guest is heavily utilizing improperly initialized v1 grant
tables, memory corruption can occur. One common manifestation is
corruption of the vmalloc list, resulting in a poisoned pointer
derefrence when accessing /proc/meminfo or /proc/vmallocinfo:

[ 40.770114] CPU 10
This patch introduces a static variable, grefs\_per\_grant\_frame, to
cache the calculated value. gnttab\_init() now calls
gnttab\_request\_version() early so that grant\_table\_version and
grefs\_per\_grant\_frame can be appropriately set. A few BUG\_ON()s have
been added to prevent this type of bug from reoccurring in the future.

target\_fabric\_port\_link() and target\_fabric\_mappedlun\_link() code to ensure
destination config\_item \*target\_item sent from configfs\_symlink() ->
config\_item\_operations->allow\_link() is the underlying se\_device->dev\_group
and se\_lun->lun\_group that we expect to symlink.

parser->chunks[.].kpage[.] is not always kmalloc-ed

ALSA: usb - fix race in creation of M-Audio Fast track pro driver
commit b98ae2729dea161edc96c9d177459b6c28bcbba5 upstream.
A patch in the 3.2 kernel caused regression with hotplugging the
M-Audio Fast track pro, or sound after suspend. I don't have the
device so I haven't done a full analysis, but it seems userspace
(both udev and pulseaudio) got confused when a card was created,
immediately destroyed, and then created again.
However, at least one person in the bug report (martin djfun)
reports that this patch resolves the issue for him. It also leaves
a message in the log:
"snd-usb-audio: probe of 1-1.1:1.1 failed with error -5" which is
a bit misleading. It is better than non-working audio, but maybe
there's a more elegant solution?

s390/time: fix sched\_clock() overflow
commit ed4f20943cd4c7b55105c04daedf8d63ab6d499c upstream.
Converting a 64 Bit TOD format value to nanoseconds means that the value
must be divided by 4.096. In order to achieve that we multiply with 125
and divide by 512.
When used within sched\_clock() this triggers an overflow after appr.
417 days. Resulting in a sched\_clock() return value that is much smaller
than previously and therefore may cause all sort of weird things in
subsystems that rely on a monotonic sched\_clock() behaviour.
To fix this implement a tod\_to\_ns() helper function which converts TOD
values without overflow and call this function from both places that
open coded the conversion: sched\_clock() and kvm\_s390\_handle\_wait().

When transport\_lookup\_tmr\_lun() fails and we return a task management
response from target\_complete\_tmr\_failure(), we need to call
transport\_cmd\_check\_stop\_to\_fabric() to release the last ref to the
cmd after calling se\_tfo->queue\_tm\_rsp(), or else we will never remove
the failed TMR from the session command list (and we'll end up waiting
forever when trying to tear down the session).

target: Fix use-after-free in LUN RESET handling
commit 72b59d6ee8adaa51f70377db0a1917ed489bead8 upstream.
If a backend IO takes a really long then an initiator might abort a
command, and then when it gives up on the abort, send a LUN reset too,
all before we process any of the original command or the abort. (The
abort will wait for the backend IO to complete too)
When the backend IO final completes (or fails), the abort handling
will proceed and queue up a "return aborted status" operation. Then,
while that's still pending, the LUN reset might find the original
command still on the LUN's list of commands and try to return aborted
status again, which leads to a use-after free when the first
se\_tfo->queue\_status call frees the command and then the second
se\_tfo->queue\_status call runs.
Fix this by removing a command from the LUN state\_list when we first
are about to queue aborted status; we shouldn't do anything
LUN-related after we've started returning status, so this seems like
the correct thing to do.

target: Fix missing CMD\_T\_ACTIVE bit regression for pending WRITEs
commit e627c615553a356f6f70215ebb3933c6e057553e upstream.
This patch fixes a regression bug introduced during v3.6.x code with
the following commit to drop transport\_add\_cmd\_to\_queue(), which
originally re-set CMD\_T\_ACTIVE during pending WRITE I/O submission:
commit af8772926f019b7bddd7477b8de5f3b0f12bad21
Author: Christoph Hellwig
Date: Sun Jul 8 15:58:49 2012 -0400
target: replace the processing thread with a TMR work queue
The following sequence happens for write commands (or any other
commands with a data out phase):
- The transport calls target\_submit\_cmd(), which sets CMD\_T\_ACTIVE in
cmd->transport\_state and sets cmd->t\_state to TRANSPORT\_NEW\_CMD.
- Things go on transport\_generic\_new\_cmd(), which notices that the
command needs to transfer data, so it sets cmd->t\_state to
TRANSPORT\_WRITE\_PENDING and calls transport\_cmd\_check\_stop().
- transport\_cmd\_check\_stop() clears CMD\_T\_ACTIVE in cmd->transport\_state
and returns in the normal case.
- Then we continue on to call ->se\_tfo->write\_pending().
- The data comes back from the initiator, and the transport calls
target\_execute\_cmd(), which sets cmd->t\_state to TRANSPORT\_PROCESSING
and calls into the backend to actually write the data.
At this point, the backend might take a long time to complete the
command, since it has to do real IO. If an abort request comes in for
this command at this point, it will not wait for the command to finish
since CMD\_T\_ACTIVE is not set. Then when the command does finally
finish, we blow up with use-after-free.
Avoid this by setting CMD\_T\_ACTIVE in target\_execute\_cmd() so that
transport\_wait\_for\_tasks() waits for the command to finish executing.
This matches the behavior from before commit 1389533ef944 ("target:
remove transport\_generic\_handle\_data"), when data was signaled via
transport\_generic\_handle\_data(), which set CMD\_T\_ACTIVE because it
called transport\_add\_cmd\_to\_queue().

ALSA: hda/hdmi - Work around "alsactl restore" errors
commit 6f54c361329dbb67dac9de174e938992651d12d7 upstream.
When "alsactl restore" is performed on HDMI codecs, it tries to
restore the channel map value since the channel map controls are
writable. But hdmi\_chmap\_ctl\_put() returns -EBADFD when no PCM stream
is assigned yet, and this results in an error message from alsactl.
Although the error is harmless, it's certainly ugly and can be
regarded as a regression.
As a workaround, this patch changes the return code in such a case to
be zero for making others happy. (A slight excuse is: when the chmap
is changed through the proper alsa-lib API, the PCM status is checked
there anyway, so we don't have to be too strict in the kernel side.)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=959210#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-05-03 11:02:15 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the ChipIdia Highspeed Dual Role Controller (CONFIG_USB_CHIPIDEA) along with the ChipIdea host controller (CONFIG_USB_CHIPIDEA_HOST) modules, is vulnerable to a kernel crash. It could occur while streaming content over network via USB/Ethernet adapter.  A user/program could use this flaw to crash the kernel, resulting in DoS.  Upstream fix: -------------  -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/929473ea05db455ad88cdc081f2adc556b8dc48f>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=959210#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2013-05-03 11:40:07 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  This issue affects the version of the kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=959210#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-09-16 17:04:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2013:1264 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1264.html>   ``` |  |

Setting SDIS (Stream Disable Mode- bit 4 of USBMODE register) fixes the problem.

However, in current code CI13XXX_DISABLE_STREAMING flag is only set in udc mode,
so allow disabling streaming also in host mode.

Tested on a mx6qsabrelite board.
