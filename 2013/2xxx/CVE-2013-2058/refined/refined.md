Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ChipIdea USB host controller driver not properly handling the disabling of streaming mode when used in host mode. The driver only disabled streaming when operating as a USB device (UDC mode), but not when acting as a host. This could lead to issues when using USB/Ethernet adapters and result in a kernel crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The driver incorrectly assumed that the streaming disable flag should only be applied in device mode.
-  The `CI13XXX_DISABLE_STREAMING` flag was not set when the controller was used in host mode, leading to potential issues when handling data streams.
- This flaw caused a transmit queue timeout due to not disabling streaming mode, leading to a kernel panic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- A user or program could trigger the crash by initiating network traffic via a USB/Ethernet adapter, rendering the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user or program would need to initiate data transfer over a USB/Ethernet adapter while the affected system is using the ChipIdea controller in host mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to send network traffic over a USB/Ethernet adapter when the system is using the ChipIdea controller.
- They do not need special privileges, as a normal user could trigger this through standard network operations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves setting the `SDIS` bit in the `USBMODE` register, thus disabling streaming when the `CI13XXX_DISABLE_STREAMING` flag is set, also when in host mode.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `929473ea05db455ad88cdc081f2adc556b8dc48f`.
- Red Hat identified the issue as "CVE-2013-2058 Kernel: usb: chipidea: Allow disabling streaming not just in udc mode"
- The issue was rated as low priority and low severity
- Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 was affected and a fix was provided in RHSA-2013:1264.
