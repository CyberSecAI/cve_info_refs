Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2563:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure storage of the administrator password hash with unsafe file permissions, allowing any local user to read it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data: The admin password hash is stored in a location accessible to any local user on the system.
- Insufficient Access Control: The file containing the password hash has overly permissive file permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Privilege Escalation: An attacker who already has local access to the system can obtain the admin password hash. This hash could then be used in offline cracking attempts, or potentially reused in other systems. Successfully obtaining the cleartext password from the hash allows the attacker to gain full administrative control over the Mambo CMS.

**Attack vectors:**

- Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the server where Mambo is installed. This could be achieved through techniques such as exploiting other vulnerabilities, social engineering, or through gaining access to compromised accounts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Local user account on the server: The attacker must have a shell account or other means of executing commands on the target system. This allows access to the configuration file containing the password hash.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content explicitly mentions a misconfiguration of `chmod` permissions on configuration files as the source of the issue. It also references a documentation page on mamboserver.com which recommends setting `configuration.php` to `777` (read, write, execute for all) which is considered highly insecure. While the page notes that it should be returned to 644, the initial insecure permissions can be exploited.
- It's implied that the admin password hash stored is not properly salted/hashed, although this is not explicitly mentioned.
