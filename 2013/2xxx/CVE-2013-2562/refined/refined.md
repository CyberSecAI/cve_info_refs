Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2562:

**CVE Description:** The provided context indicates that CVE-2013-2562 is assigned for "the storage of the cleartext MySQL database password in the document root" within Mambo CMS.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure practice of storing the MySQL database password in plaintext within a file located in the web server's document root. This allows any local user with access to the server's file system to read the configuration file and obtain the database credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage:** The primary weakness is storing sensitive database credentials in plaintext.
- **Insecure File Location:** The configuration file is stored within the web server's document root, making it easily accessible to local users.
- **Insufficient Permissions:** The provided documentation link mentions that default CHMOD settings of `configuration.php` are set to 777, allowing any user to read and modify the file. Although a recommendation to set it to 644 after changes is provided, the initial weak permissions is still a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** An attacker can gain complete control over the MySQL database. This includes reading sensitive data, modifying records, and potentially escalating privileges.
- **Website Takeover:** With database access, the attacker can potentially gain administrative access to the Mambo CMS and completely compromise the website.
- **Data Breach:** Sensitive data stored within the database could be accessed and exposed, leading to potential privacy violations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local user or an attacker who has gained local access to the server's file system can read the plaintext database password from the configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the server's filesystem, which includes local users, or users who may have gained access through other vulnerabilities.
