Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Nagios handles authorization for servicegroup views. Specifically, if a user has access to *any* service within a servicegroup, they are granted access to view *all* services and hosts within that group, regardless of whether they are explicitly authorized for those specific services/hosts. This deviates from the expected behavior where authorization should be enforced on a per-service and per-host basis.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** Nagios fails to properly enforce authorization for servicegroup views, allowing users to bypass configured access restrictions.
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users can view monitoring data (hosts and services) that they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Monitoring Data Access:** An attacker with limited Nagios access can view sensitive information about hosts and services they are not meant to see, potentially revealing infrastructure details, service statuses, and performance metrics.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Knowledge gained from unauthorized access could facilitate further attacks targeting those systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered via the Nagios web interface when a user accesses the servicegroup overview, summary, or grid views.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Nagios User Account:** The attacker needs a valid Nagios user account with access to *at least one* service in order to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** Network access to the Nagios web interface is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- It was initially believed to be a security flaw but later determined by the Nagios team to be an intended feature/design, not a bug.
- The vulnerability was introduced in Nagios version 3.4.0
- The issue was addressed in later releases through patches that modify the behavior of servicegroup views.
- The scope of this vulnerability is limited to information disclosure; it doesn't allow for remote code execution.
