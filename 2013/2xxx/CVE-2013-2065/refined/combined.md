* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Details

Charlie Somerville discovered that Ruby incorrectly handled floating point

number conversion. An attacker could possibly use this issue with an

application that converts text to floating point numbers to cause the

application to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-4164](/security/CVE-2013-4164))

Vit Ondruch discovered that Ruby did not perform taint checking for certain

functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain

intended restrictions. ([CVE-2013-2065](/security/CVE-2013-2065))

 straight-forward, and extensible.

 .

 In the name of this package, `1.9.1' indicates the Ruby library

 compatibility version. This package currently provides the `1.9.3'

 branch of Ruby, which is compatible with the `1.9.1' branch.

 files and to do system management tasks (as in perl). It is simple,

 straight-forward, and extensible.

 .

 This package contains the header files and the mkmf library, necessary

 to make extension library for Ruby 1.9.1. It is also required to build

 many gems.

Examples for Ruby 1.9

This package provides example programs about Ruby 1.9.1.

[ruby1.9.1-full](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/ruby1.9.1-full):
Ruby 1.9.1 full installation

For many good reasons, the Ruby programming language is split in many

 small different packages. Installing this package will make sure you have

 all the packages that add up to a full Ruby installation, with the exception

 of the Tcl/Tk bindings for Ruby, which are only recommended.

 .

 This package installs the dependencies for Ruby compatibility version 1.9.1

 (currently Ruby 1.9.3).

[ruby1.9.3](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/ruby1.9.3):
Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby, version 1.9.3

Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy

 object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text

 files and to do system management tasks (as in perl). It is simple,

 straight-forward, and extensible.

 .

 Ruby uses two parallel versioning schemes: the `Ruby library compatibility

 version' (1.9.1 for this package), which is similar to a library SONAME, and

 the `Ruby version' (1.9.3 for this package). Ruby packages in Debian are

 named using the Ruby library compatibility version, which is sometimes

 confusing for users who do not follow Ruby development closely. This package

 depends on the ruby1.9.1 package, and provides compatibility symbolic links

 from 1.9.3 executables and manual pages to their 1.9.1 counterparts.

# Object taint bypassing in DL and Fiddle in Ruby (CVE-2013-2065)

Posted by usa on 14 May 2013

There is a vulnerability in DL and Fiddle in Ruby where tainted strings can be
used by system calls regardless of the $SAFE level set in Ruby. This
vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-2065.

## Impact

Native functions exposed to Ruby with DL or Fiddle do not check the taint
values set on the objects passed in. This can result in tainted objects being
accepted as input when a SecurityError exception should be raised.

Impacted DL code will look something like this:

```
def my_function(user_input)
  handle    = DL.dlopen(nil)
  sys_cfunc = DL::CFunc.new(handle['system'], DL::TYPE_INT, 'system')
  sys       = DL::Function.new(sys_cfunc, [DL::TYPE_VOIDP])
  sys.call user_input
end

$SAFE = 1
my_function "uname -rs".taint
```

Impacted Fiddle code will look something like this:

```
def my_function(user_input)
  handle    = DL.dlopen(nil)
  sys = Fiddle::Function.new(handle['system'],
                             [Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP], Fiddle::TYPE_INT)
  sys.call user_input
end

$SAFE = 1
my_function "uname -rs".taint
```

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.

Note that this *does not* prevent numeric memory offsets from being used as
pointer values. Numbers cannot be tainted, so code passing a numeric memory
offset cannot be checked. For example:

```
def my_function(input)
  handle    = DL.dlopen(nil)
  sys = Fiddle::Function.new(handle['system'],
                             [Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP], Fiddle::TYPE_INT)
  sys.call input
end

$SAFE = 1
user_input = "uname -rs".taint
my_function DL::CPtr[user_input].to_i
```

In this case, the memory location is passed, and taintedness of the object
cannot be determined by DL / Fiddle. In this case, please check the tainting
of the user input before passing the memory location:

```
user_input = "uname -rs".taint
raise if $SAFE >= 1 && user_input.tainted?
my_function DL::CPtr[user_input].to_i
```
## Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade Ruby, this monkey patch can be used as a workaround:

```
class Fiddle::Function
  alias :old_call :call
  def call(*args)
    if $SAFE >= 1 && args.any? { |x| x.tainted? }
      raise SecurityError, "tainted parameter not allowed"
    end
    old_call(*args)
  end
end
```
## Affected versions

* All ruby 1.9 versions prior to ruby 1.9.3 patchlevel 426
* All ruby 2.0 versions prior to ruby 2.0.0 patchlevel 195
* prior to trunk revision 40728

ruby 1.8 versions are not affected.
