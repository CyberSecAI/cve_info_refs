Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the way Ruby's DL and Fiddle libraries handle tainted objects when calling native functions. Specifically, these libraries fail to perform taint checks on objects passed as arguments to native functions, which could be system calls, which could allow the execution of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Taint Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass Ruby's taint mechanism.  Taint is a security feature that marks data from untrusted sources. Normally, a SecurityError would be raised if a tainted string was used in a context where it could be dangerous. In the case of DL and Fiddle, tainted data could be passed to system calls without restriction.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  DL and Fiddle did not validate whether the data passed to native functions was tainted or not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By passing tainted strings to system calls, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system, or cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This is because the tainted data could contain malicious commands or input to the system calls.
*   **Security Restriction Bypass:** The vulnerability allows the bypass of intended security restrictions implemented using Ruby's $SAFE level and taint checking.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker could supply malicious input to an application that uses DL or Fiddle to interface with native functions. The input would be tainted and used in a system call.
*   **Indirect Execution:** Malicious code is not injected directly into the application, but rather it utilizes the application's own functions to perform malicious actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply input to a Ruby application that uses either the DL or Fiddle libraries.
*   **Target Application Using DL/Fiddle:** The attacker needs to target a Ruby application that uses DL or Fiddle to call native functions (especially system calls) with user-provided data.
*   **Understanding of Ruby Taint Mechanism:** To exploit this, the attacker needs to understand how Ruby's taint mechanism works, or the lack of checks in this case.

**More Details than CVE Description:**

*   The provided text gives specific examples using `DL.dlopen` and `Fiddle::Function` to demonstrate how the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   The workaround of using a monkey patch for the `Fiddle::Function` class to check for tainted parameters is provided, which offers more details for immediate mitigation.
*   The content clarifies the exploitation case where memory offsets are used directly, and the vulnerability cannot detect taintedness because numbers cannot be tainted in Ruby.
*   The specific versions of ruby affected are given.
*   The vulnerability is not present in Ruby 1.8

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-2065 is a vulnerability in Ruby's DL and Fiddle libraries that allows tainted data to be passed to native functions without proper checks, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and bypassing of security restrictions. The vulnerability was fixed in Ruby 1.9.3 patchlevel 426, Ruby 2.0.0 patchlevel 195 and trunk revision 40728.
