{
  "CVE-2013-2618": {
    "Root cause": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when setting map titles and other fields in `editor.php`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Allows uploading of malicious PHP code"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the map title, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the file list. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.  Also, the upload of malicious PHP code to the webserver could allow for arbitrary code execution if an attacker has direct access to that file.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By crafting a malicious map title using the `map_title` parameter in `editor.php`",
      "By uploading malicious PHP code through other vulnerable fields"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or edit a map and insert malicious code into the map title through the `editor.php` interface. An attacker needs direct access to the uploaded PHP file to execute it."
