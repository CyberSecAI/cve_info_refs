{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Red Hat Network Satellite did not fully check the authenticity of a client beyond the initial authentication check during an Inter-Satellite Sync (ISS) operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate authentication checks",
      "Lack of authorization enforcement"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could obtain all channel content from any Red Hat Network Satellite server that could be reached, even if Inter-Satellite Sync support was disabled.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker modifies the satellite-sync client to skip the initial authentication call.",
        "The attacker needs to have network access to the Red Hat Satellite Server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the satellite-sync client and must be able to reach the satellite server over the network.",
     "more_details": "The satellite-sync client only verified the client's authenticity during the initial /SAT check but did not check any subsequent connections to the sync service."
