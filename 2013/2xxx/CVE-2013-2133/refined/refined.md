{
  "CVE-2013-2133": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw was found in the way method-level authorization for JAX-WS Service endpoints was performed by the EJB invocation handler implementation. Any restrictions declared on EJB methods were ignored when executing the JAX-WS handlers, and only class-level restrictions were applied.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper enforcement of method-level access control restrictions on JAX-WS Service endpoints."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker, authorized to access the EJB class, could invoke a JAX-WS handler that they were not authorized to invoke, leading to a potential security bypass.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation through JAX-WS Service endpoints."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authorized to access the EJB class to exploit the vulnerability."
  }
