The provided content is related to CVE-2013-2008.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the WordPress plugin "WP-Super-Cache" handles form actions. Specifically, it uses `$_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]` to dynamically set the form's action attribute which can be manipulated to introduce an XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The use of `$_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]` in the form's action attribute allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts by manipulating the request URI.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would execute in the context of a user's browser when they interact with the vulnerable form. This can lead to various malicious activities such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulation of the `REQUEST_URI`: An attacker can inject malicious script into the URI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the request URI, such as through a crafted link or other methods to control the request.
