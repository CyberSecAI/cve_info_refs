Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2556:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) within the Windows operating system. Specifically, the issue lies in how the system loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), allowing them to be loaded at arbitrary, non-random offsets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **ASLR Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the ASLR security feature, which is designed to randomize memory addresses, making it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **DLL Loading at Arbitrary Addresses**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to load a DLL at a predictable, non-random address, which can be exploited for malicious purposes

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Feature Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass ASLR, a key security mitigation.
*   **DLL Injection:** By bypassing ASLR, an attacker can load a malicious DLL into a targeted process, potentially gaining control over the process and system. This could lead to a variety of attacks, including remote code execution if combined with another vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local or Remote Code Execution Chain:** The vulnerability is not directly exploitable for code execution but rather acts as an enabler for such exploits. It's likely exploited during or in the course of exploiting a separate remote code execution vulnerability, where ASLR bypass is required to load and execute the malicious code. The provided documentation mentions that an attacker would need to load a malicious DLL during a Remote Code Execution exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local or Remote access**: An attacker would need to have some form of access to the system. They would need a way to initiate code execution, be that remotely or locally through an existing vulnerability. The attacker would then use this vulnerability to bypass ASLR.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described in the context of a larger Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS13-063) which addresses multiple vulnerabilities.
*   The provided document lists this issue as a "security feature bypass vulnerability" and specifies that it is publicly known.
*   The advisory mentions the vulnerability was reported by VUPEN Security working with HP's Zero Day Initiative, and Yang Yu of Nsfocus Security Team.
*   The bulletin also indicates that Microsoft was not aware of active exploitation at the time of release.
