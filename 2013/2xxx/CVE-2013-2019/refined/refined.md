Based on the provided content, CVE-2013-2019 is assigned to a stack overflow vulnerability in the BOINC client code.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the client code not properly handling multiple `file_signature` elements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution on the client machine.

**Attack vectors:** A malicious server can send a specially crafted response with multiple file_signature elements to trigger the stack overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to act as a malicious BOINC server, or to compromise a legitimate server. The attacker can then send malicious data to the clients.

**Vulnerable versions:** BOINC client versions 6.10.58 and 6.12.34 are vulnerable. Version 7.x is not vulnerable.
