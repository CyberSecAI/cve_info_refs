Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way WordPress performs hash computations when checking passwords for password-protected posts. Specifically, a computationally intensive process was triggered by specially crafted password inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability: The primary weakness is the susceptibility to a DoS attack.
- Excessive CPU Usage: The crafted input forces the system to perform extensive calculations, leading to excessive CPU usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service, rendering the WordPress site inaccessible or unresponsive.
- Resource Exhaustion: Excessive CPU usage can degrade server performance, affecting other services on the same server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Password Input: Attackers can submit carefully crafted strings as passwords when attempting to access password-protected content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Publicly Accessible: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login mechanism for password-protected posts, meaning the protected content needs to be publicly accessible.
- No Prior Authentication: The attacker doesn't need prior access or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 3.5.2.
- The issue was related to the use of `phpass` library for password hashing.
- The vulnerability could be triggered by a single request, which was the main vector for the DOS attack.
