{
  "cveId": "CVE-2013-2503",
  "baseScore": "4.3",
  "rootCause": "Privoxy does not properly handle HTTP 407 'Proxy Authentication Required' responses, forwarding the 'Proxy-Authenticate' and 'Proxy-Authorization' headers unmodified. This allows a malicious website to spoof a proxy authentication request.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522)"
  ],
  "impact": "A malicious website can trick a user into providing their proxy credentials by spoofing a proxy authentication request, which can then be captured and reused by the attacker.",
  "attackVectors": [
    "A user visits a malicious website through Privoxy which is configured to use a proxy server.",
     "The malicious website responds with a 407 'Proxy Authentication Required' HTTP response and a 'Proxy-Authenticate: Basic' header."
   ],
  "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious website accessible to the victim and the victim needs to use Privoxy as a proxy."
