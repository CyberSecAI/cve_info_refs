Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2455:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2013-2455 and provides details about the vulnerability it describes. Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT** to the specified CVE.

**2. Extraction of Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is improper access checks in `getEnclosingClass`, `getEnclosingMethod`, and `getEnclosingConstructor` methods within the OpenJDK.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability is due to inadequate access control checks in the mentioned methods, allowing an untrusted Java applet or application to potentially reveal sensitive information about the enclosing class, method, or constructor.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An untrusted Java application or applet that calls the vulnerable methods could exploit this flaw.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to run an untrusted Java application or applet.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make calls to the vulnerable methods (`getEnclosingClass`, `getEnclosingMethod`, and `getEnclosingConstructor`).

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The issue was fixed in IcedTea6 versions 1.11.12 and 1.12.6, and IcedTea7 versions 2.1.9, 2.2.9, 2.3.10, and 2.4.1.
*   The vulnerability affects OpenJDK and also IBM Java versions, with fixes being included in corresponding security updates.
*   The vulnerability is related to the improper access checks performed by the `getEnclosing*` methods. It does not involve the execution of arbitrary code, but rather the disclosure of potentially sensitive information.
*   The fix involves adding access checks before retrieving the requested information.

**4. Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The `java.lang.Class` API had insufficient checks when calling methods like `getEnclosingClass`, `getEnclosingMethod` and `getEnclosingConstructor`.
*   The fix implemented by upstream OpenJDK includes additional checks via the  `checkMemberAccess` method within the class that retrieves information.
*   The issue affected not just OpenJDK itself, but also derived distributions like IcedTea, IBM JDK, and Oracle JDK.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by untrusted applets or applications.

**5. Summary:**
The CVE-2013-2455 is related to information disclosure via improper access checks by getEnclosing* methods in Java. An untrusted applet or application can access information it shouldn't be able to. The vulnerability is fixed by applying security updates which contain the corrected code. The vulnerability is of medium severity.
