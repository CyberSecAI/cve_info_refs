Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-2564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper authentication enforcement when initiating a file upload process in Mambo CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unauthenticated Resource Consumption:** The system allows unauthenticated users to initiate the file upload process, which consumes server resources, specifically memory and bandwidth.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly initiating file upload requests, an attacker can exhaust server resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. The server's performance can be degraded, or it could potentially crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this. They only require network access to the target server.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The specific vulnerable URL is provided: `<http://<target> ip>/mambots/editors/mostlyce/jscripts/tiny_mce/filemanager/frmupload.html`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker initiates a file upload to this URL which is possible even without authentication to the application. While the upload will not be completed since authentication is required for saving the file, the server resources will be used to process the request.
*   The content clarifies that while the upload doesn't complete (due to authentication requirements for saving the file), the initial processing of the upload consumes resources, thus creating a DoS vector.
