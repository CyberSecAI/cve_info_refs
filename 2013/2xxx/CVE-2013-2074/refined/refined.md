Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of URLs within the KDE libraries (`kdelibs`). Specifically, when an "internal server error" occurs, the system was using the `m_request.url.url()` function to display the URL in the error message. This function would include the username and password if they were present in the URL (e.g., `https://user:password@example.com`). The correct function to use here was `m_request.url.prettyUrl()` which sanitizes the URL before displaying it, removing sensitive information like the password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability was the exposure of usernames and passwords embedded in URLs.
*   **Improper Error Handling:** The error handling routine used a function that could expose sensitive information.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system failed to sanitize the URL before displaying it to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to user credentials.
*   **Compromised Accounts:** Exposed credentials could be used to access the user's resources on the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Web Pages:** Attackers could trick a user into accessing a specially crafted web page that would cause an "internal server error" on the server.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** Although not directly mentioned, a MITM attack could potentially trigger this by altering server responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to trigger server errors:** An attacker would need to be able to generate a server-side error to force the application to display the vulnerable error message. This could potentially be achieved through malformed or crafted requests or by causing backend issues.
*   **Local access (indirectly):** The exploit results in information being displayed on the local users machine.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code was in `kioslave/http/http.cpp`.
*   The fix involved replacing calls to `m_request.url.url()` with `m_request.url.prettyUrl()`.
*   The `prettyUrl()` function was designed to remove passwords from URLs, among other things, making it safe for display.
*   The vulnerability was also present in older versions of kdelibs, including KDE3.
*   Multiple instances of `url()` usage in error messages were found, and all had to be addressed by the fix.
