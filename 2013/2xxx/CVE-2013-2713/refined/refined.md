**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient verification of the HTTP request origin in the `/users_maint.html` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: The application doesn't properly validate the source of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

*   The malicious webpage contains a form that, upon submission, sends a forged request to the vulnerable application (`/users_maint.html`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage with malicious code.
*   The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting that webpage.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the application server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to create a new user account with the username "username" and password "password" using a malicious form that auto submits upon loading.
