  "CVE-2013-2453": {
    "description": "The JMX component did not properly implement certain class checks. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass intended package restrictions.",
    "root_cause": "The MBeanServer Introspector in the JMX component did not properly verify package access, leading to a potential bypass of package restrictions.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect class access verification in JMX MBeanServer Introspector"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass intended package restrictions by exploiting the improper class checks, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by deploying a malicious Java application or applet.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to deploy and execute a malicious Java applet or application.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability is related to the insufficient access control in the MBeanServer Introspector. The fix ensures that proper checks are done while performing reflection."
