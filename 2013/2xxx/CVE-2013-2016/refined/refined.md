  "CVE-2013-2016": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way qemu v1.3.0 and later (virtio-rng) validates addresses when guest accesses the config space of a virtio device. If the virtio device has zero/small sized config space, such as virtio-rng, a privileged guest user could use this flaw to access the matching host's qemu address space and thus increase their privileges on the host.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient address validation within the QEMU virtio implementation when a guest OS accesses the configuration space of a virtio device, particularly devices with small or zero-sized config spaces such as virtio-rng. The address validation was done using subtraction, which can lead to underflow, and after accessing the config space, which could cause a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds read/write",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user can potentially read and write to the host's QEMU address space, leading to privilege escalation on the host system.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Accessing the virtio configuration space via guest OS."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "A privileged user account within a guest OS.",
      "Ability to interact with virtio devices within the guest OS."
    ],
    "additional_notes": [
        "The vulnerability is particularly exploitable when the mmap_min_addr setting on the host is set to 0, as this allows memory mappings at the beginning of the address space, and without a proper validation, a guest can access this area.",
        "The issue affects virtio-rng (random number generator) devices with a zero config space, that can be found in qemu v1.3.0 and later.",
        "The fix involved validating the address before accessing the config and using addition instead of subtraction.",
        "The practical impact of the vulnerability is limited to systems where the mmap_min_addr protection is disabled on the host, which could lead to a crash due to a segmentation fault, unless the address range was accessible.",
        "The vulnerability was introduced in QEMU v1.3.0, and prior versions are not affected."
