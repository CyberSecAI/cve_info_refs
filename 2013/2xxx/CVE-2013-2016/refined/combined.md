A flaw was found in the way qemu v1.3.0 and later (virtio-rng) validates
addresses when guest accesses the config space of a virtio device. If the
virtio device has zero/small sized config space, such as virtio-rng, a
privileged guest user could use this flaw to access the matching host's
qemu address space and thus increase their privileges on the host.

Ok so this does NOT affect Linux systems using mmap_min_addr with a
sane default value (e.g. larger than 0). However more than a few
systems have shipped with mmap_min_addr set to 0, not picking on
Debian, just the first result I found:

<http://wiki.debian.org/mmap_min_addr>

"In Debian 5.0.0 through 5.0.3 inclusive, the 2.6.26 kernel is shipped
with a default mmap_min_addr of '0'."

Hopefully everyone has upgraded to 5.0.4 =).

So there is a realistic potential for systems to be affected (e.g. if
this had been fixed 10 years ago I'd have probably not given a CVE,
but 3 years is not a super long time).

Please use CVE-2013-2016 for virtio-pci: properly validate address
before accessing config.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# CVE-2013-2016

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2013-2015.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2013-2017.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2013-2016 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2016)

#### Description

A flaw was found in the way qemu v1.3.0 and later (virtio-rng) validates addresses when guest accesses the config space of a virtio device. If the virtio device has zero/small sized config space, such as virtio-rng, a privileged guest user could use this flaw to access the matching host's qemu address space and thus increase their privileges on the host.

Hi,
An out-of-bounds issue in virtio was published for qemu:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-2016>

I've checked squeeze and wheezy (both qemu and qemu-kvm).  They are
both not affected.

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.

For further information see:

Yes, that's the case.  However, the issue is so small, --
they wern't sure it is worth assigning a CVE# for it.
I even forgot to include the fix for it to the latest
1.5.0-3 release.

Setting severity as that.

Thank you for that!

Yes, sure.  Thank you for the bugreport and the diagnostics!

Hmm.  Now I'm really confused.

Upstream version 1.5.0 includes the fix for this issue, so
filing the bug against 1.5.0+dfsg-1 package is kind of wrong.
The fix is commit 5f5a1318653c08e435cfa52f60b6a712815b659d
which was applied past 1.5.0~rc0.

Yes, the experimental version of qemu, based on 1.5.0~rc0,
is buggy, but do we really care about it, especially since
current version is already fixed?

To me it looks like no debian version of qemu is affected.

Thanks!

Is that a complete fix?  The suggested patch in the redhat bug [0]
also adds checks to virtio-pci.c, which is what I had used for
reference when checking whether this was fixed or not, and that is not
applied in the debian package yet.

Best wishes,
Mike

The fix referred to from that redhat bugreport (which is here --
<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-04/msg05254.html>
or <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/208677> )
was a suggested patch.  After which some discussion emerged (see
the thread on gmane), and another, V2 version of the same patch were
sent, which is here -- <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/241991/> or
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/210292> -- which has
been applied as 5f5a1318653c08e, which is included in 1.5.0-rc1 and up.

virtio: properly validate address before accessing config

```
There are several several issues in the current checking:

- The check was based on the minus of unsigned values which can overflow
- It was done after .{set|get}_config() which can lead crash when config_len
  is zero since vdev->config is NULL

Fix this by:

- Validate the address in virtio_pci_config_{read|write}() before
  .{set|get}_config
- Use addition instead minus to do the validation

Please note this only affects virtio-rng which appeared in qemu v1.3.0 and on,
released on Mon Dec 3 2012. So you'd need a distro with an old kernel
that has an updated qemu or qemu-kvm (or backported the bug in virtio-rng).

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-04-29 09:38:31 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  A flaw was found in the way qemu validates addresses when guest accesses the config space of a  virtio device. If the virtio device has zero/small sized config space, such as virtio-rng, a  privileged guest user could use this flaw to access the matching host's qemu address space and thus  increase their privileges on the host.  Acknowledgements:                                                                 This issue was found by Jason Wang of Red Hat.  References: <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-04/msg05013.html>  Proposed upstream patch: <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-04/msg05254.html>   @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please say explicitly if it is ready for the stabilization or not ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Doug Goldstein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-05-07 16:33:37 UTC  ``` The issue only exists with older kernels when there is no min_mmap_addr with a newer qemu (1.3.0 or newer). Not sure what maintainers really can do/should do. Really up to the security team.  No current sys-kernel/gentoo-sources in tree are affected with any app-emulation/qemu in tree. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-08-30 00:39:31 UTC  ``` @Cardoe: before I close this, could you please clarify which kernel versions would be affected? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-07-06 03:49:58 UTC  ``` @kernel, can we confirm if any of the in tree security supported kernels are vulnerable? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Matthias Maier   gentoo-dev  2016-09-27 02:09:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to Doug Goldstein from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=467846#c1)) > No current sys-kernel/gentoo-sources in tree are affected with any > app-emulation/qemu in tree.  I suggest we resolve this issue now? qemu is currently at version 2.7.0. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-03-27 08:52:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Chris Reffett from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=467846#c2)) > @Cardoe: before I close this, could you please clarify which kernel versions > would be affected?  Since kernel v2.6.23-rc1, mmap protection was available in kernels containing commit ed0321895182ffb6ecf210e066d87911b270d587. However, this protection was disabled per default.  This became at least configurable with >=2.6.25-rc1 due to commit a5ecbcb8c13ea8a822d243bf782d0dc9525b4f84.  Looks like until 2.6.31-rc7, the protection was still disabled per default. So vanilla kernels shipping commit 788084aba2ab7348257597496befcbccabdc98a3 were the first kernels with mmap_min_addr != 0 per default.  Debian set a value >0 with their 2.6.26-21 kernel package for the first time. I haven't checked if Gentoo ever patched any available kernel sources before upstream activated protection per default but there are indications (<https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-5891369.html>) that at least gentoo-sources-2.6.30-r4 has set a value of 4096.  So a safe answer to Chris' question is <*-sources-2.6.31 in the assumption that we didn't mess with this option.  Closing because repository is clean. All done. ``` |  |
