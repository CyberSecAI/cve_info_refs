  "CVE-2013-2234": {
    "description": "An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key_socket implementation in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information in kernel memory.",
    "vulnerability": "Information leak in the Linux kernel's IPSec key_socket implementation.",
    "impact": "A local user can examine potentially sensitive information in kernel memory.",
    "attack_vector": "Local user access to the PF_KEY key_sockets is required.",
     "weakness": "The `key_notify_sa_flush()` and `key_notify_policy_flush()` functions in net/key/af_key.c do not initialize the `sadb_msg_reserved` member of the broadcasted message, leading to a heap memory leak to listeners.",
