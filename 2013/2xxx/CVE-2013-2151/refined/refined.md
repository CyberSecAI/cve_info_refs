Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-2151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an unquoted search path flaw in the installation process of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) agent on Windows systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unquoted Search Path:** The installer uses an unquoted search path when launching the RHEV agent service. This means if a malicious file is placed in a directory within the search path, it may be executed instead of the intended application, as Windows will execute the first matching executable found in the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This allows the attacker to gain full control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the Windows system where the RHEV agent is installed.
- **Malicious File Placement:** The attacker needs to place a malicious executable file within a directory present in the unquoted search path used by the service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a local user account on the target Windows system.
- The attacker must be able to write files to directories within the unquoted search path.
