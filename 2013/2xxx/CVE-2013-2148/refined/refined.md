Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2148:

**Root Cause:**

- The `fill_event_metadata` function in the Linux kernel's `fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify_user.c` file, which is responsible for preparing fanotify event data for userspace, failed to initialize the `reserved` field of the `fanotify_event_metadata` structure. This uninitialized memory could then be read by user-level applications through a fanotify descriptor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Information Leak:** The core vulnerability is an information leak. Due to the lack of initialization, the reserved field can expose stack memory content from the kernel to user space. This memory can contain sensitive information.
- **Missing Initialization:** Failure to properly initialize a structure member before it's copied or accessed. This is a common programming error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can read arbitrary kernel memory from the stack and obtain potentially sensitive data. This may include:
    - Kernel addresses
    - Contents of kernel data structures
    - Other data that happens to be residing in that part of memory

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local user who has access to the system.
- **Fanotify Interface:** The attacker must trigger a fanotify event. Then, by reading the contents of a fanotify descriptor, the attacker can access uninitialized memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the system.
- **Access to Fanotify:** The attacker needs the ability to create a fanotify group and monitor events.
- **System with Vulnerable Kernel:**  The target system must have a Linux kernel with `CONFIG_FANOTIFY` enabled and be running a vulnerable kernel.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `fill_event_metadata` function of `fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify_user.c`.
-  The fix involves explicitly setting the `reserved` field of the `fanotify_event_metadata` structure to `0` before the structure is copied back to userspace.
- The `fanotify` interface provides a mechanism to monitor file system events. This vulnerability exploits a flaw in the way fanotify events are prepared.

In summary, CVE-2013-2148 is an information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's fanotify implementation that could allow a local user to disclose sensitive kernel memory.
