### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 19:49:46 UTC  ``` Thierry Carrez (secalert) reports:  Title: Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature Reporter: Paul McMillan (Nebula) Products: python-keystoneclient Affects: version 0.2.3 to 0.2.5  Description: Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the encryption ([CVE-2013-2166](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2166)) or signing ([CVE-2013-2167](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2167)) security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers) and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache_security_strategy are affected.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 19:59:06 UTC  ``` In general the memcached for OpenStack (and any memcached deployment generally speaking) should be restricted to trusted systems due to the lack of authentication in memcached. However the signing/encryption of data within memcached is an attempt to alleviate this problems so systems using these capabilities may have exposed memcached to untrusted systems.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 20:40:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 760946](attachment.cgi?id=760946&action=diff "client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=760946&action=edit "client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch") client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 20:48:34 UTC  ``` Red Hat OpenStack 1 (Essex) and 2.1 (Folsom) do not contain the affected code and are not affected as such.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:43:05 UTC  ``` THIs is now public <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/06/19/5>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c10)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:44:36 UTC  ``` Created python-keystoneclient tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 976024](show_bug.cgi?id=976024 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-2166 CVE-2013-2167 python-keystoneclient: middleware memcache encryption and signing bypass [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c11)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:45:18 UTC  ``` Created python-keystoneclient tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 976025](show_bug.cgi?id=976025 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-2166 CVE-2013-2167 python-keystoneclient: middleware memcache encryption and signing bypass [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c13)  Murray McAllister    2013-06-24 06:35:10 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Paul McMillan of Nebula as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-27 16:51:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0992 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0992.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c15)  Fedora Update System    2013-08-15 02:34:24 UTC  ``` python-keystoneclient-0.2.3-7.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

## Synopsis

Important: python-keystoneclient security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0992)

## Topic

Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix two security issues, one
bug, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0
(Grizzly) Preview.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

Python-keystoneclient is the client library and command line utility for
interacting with the OpenStack identity API.

A flaw was found in the way python-keystoneclient handled encrypted data
from memcached. Even when the memcache\_security\_strategy setting in
"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf" was set to ENCRYPT to help prevent
tampering, an attacker on the local network, or possibly an unprivileged
user in a virtual machine hosted on OpenStack, could use this flaw to
bypass intended restrictions and modify data in memcached that will later
be used by services utilizing python-keystoneclient (such as Nova, Cinder,
Swift, Glance, and so on). (CVE-2013-2166)

A flaw was found in the way python-keystoneclient verified data from
memcached. Even when the memcache\_security\_strategy setting in
"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf" was set to MAC to perform signature
checking, an attacker on the local network, or possibly an unprivileged
user in a virtual machine hosted on OpenStack, could use this flaw to
modify data in memcached that will later pass signature checking in
python-keystoneclient. (CVE-2013-2167)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Paul McMillan of Nebula as the original
reporter.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* python-webob1.2 (which can be installed in parallel with python-webob1.0)

was not found by python-keystoneclient. Attempting to import python-webob
from python-keystoneclient failed with a stack trace. This could also be
observed with other applications using python-keystoneclient, such as
OpenStack Swift. With this update, python-keystoneclient can import
python-webob1.2 independently from other installed versions. (BZ#971026)

Additionally, this update adds the following enhancement:

* This update adds support for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Signature Version

4 to python-keystoneclient. This makes python-keystoneclient compatible
with future versions of python-boto, which will use Signature Version 4 by
default. (BZ#970134)

All users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview are advised to install
these updated packages, which correct these issues and add this
enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

Thanks. Uploaded.

Though I've noticed that some of the unit tests are failing after

service-list, keystone tenant-list, etc. worked)

Subject: [OSSA 2013-017] Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption
 feature (CVE-2013-2166, CVE-2013-2167)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-017
CVE: CVE-2013-2166, CVE-2013-2167
Date: June 19, 2013
Title: Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature
Reporter: Paul McMillan (Nebula)
Products: python-keystoneclient
Affects: version 0.2.3 to 0.2.5

Description:
Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation
of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An
attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a
man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially
bypass the encryption (CVE-2013-2166) or signing (CVE-2013-2167)
security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of
memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers)
and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache_security_strategy are affected.

python-keystoneclient fix (will be included in upcoming 0.2.6 release):
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/33661>

### Bug Description

The memcache signing middleware in python-keystoneclient is improperly implemented, such that it does not provide the advertised data integrity features. An attacker with access to the memcache instance used as a cache could insert false or changed data which would be silently accepted by the client.

<https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/memcache_crypt.py>

When the 'MAC' security strategy is enabled, the middleware falls through to silently trusting data which is missing the "MAC\_MARKER" prefix. When this mode is enabled, the middleware should require all data to be signed, and raise an error when encountering unsigned or incorrectly signed data.

Furthermore, the construction of the MAC:

h(data || token)

is improper, accepting attacker generated signatures with trivial effort since it involves no data which is not available to an attacker.

Instead, it should use the standard HMAC construction:

HMAC (K,m) = H ((K ⊕ opad) ∥ H ((K ⊕ ipad) ∥ m))

where K is a secret key, m is the message, and opad and ipad are standard constants.

The secret key should be produced using an approved key derivation function which differs from the key used when the 'ENCRYPTION' security strategy is in use. More details on appropriate functions are available in NIST Special Publication 800-108.

As currently written, this feature provides no security benefits whatsoever. I will be proposing a patch later today to fix the issues outlined above. I plan to fix this issue in a forwards-compatible way, with the side effect of invalidating existing ephemeral cache values for users who enabled this feature. This should have a CVE. I'm ok with marking this bug as public given the minimal potential for exploitation (an attacker needs access to the memcache instance, which should never happen in a proper deployment) and the assumed low usage rate of this feature.

Good one! Yes, we should get absolutely get rid of the marker checking logic. Error out if we can't verify or decrypt data.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 19:49:46 UTC  ``` Thierry Carrez (secalert) reports:  Title: Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature Reporter: Paul McMillan (Nebula) Products: python-keystoneclient Affects: version 0.2.3 to 0.2.5  Description: Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the encryption ([CVE-2013-2166](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2166)) or signing ([CVE-2013-2167](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2167)) security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers) and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache_security_strategy are affected.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 19:59:06 UTC  ``` In general the memcached for OpenStack (and any memcached deployment generally speaking) should be restricted to trusted systems due to the lack of authentication in memcached. However the signing/encryption of data within memcached is an attempt to alleviate this problems so systems using these capabilities may have exposed memcached to untrusted systems.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 20:40:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 760946](attachment.cgi?id=760946&action=diff "client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=760946&action=edit "client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch") client-CVE-2013-2166-CVE-2013-2167.patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 20:48:34 UTC  ``` Red Hat OpenStack 1 (Essex) and 2.1 (Folsom) do not contain the affected code and are not affected as such.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:43:05 UTC  ``` THIs is now public <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/06/19/5>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c10)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:44:36 UTC  ``` Created python-keystoneclient tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 976024](show_bug.cgi?id=976024 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-2166 CVE-2013-2167 python-keystoneclient: middleware memcache encryption and signing bypass [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c11)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-19 18:45:18 UTC  ``` Created python-keystoneclient tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 976025](show_bug.cgi?id=976025 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-2166 CVE-2013-2167 python-keystoneclient: middleware memcache encryption and signing bypass [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=974271#c13)  Murray McAllister    2013-06-24 06:35:10 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these issues.

### [jdstrand](https://launchpad.net/~jdstrand)

per upstream, feature exposing this bug was introduced in Grizzly as
an optional feature
fix for CVE-2013-2166 implemented in this patchset
per upstream, patch is forward compatible, but will invalidate any
existing ephemeral encrypted or signed memcache entries. This is too
disruptive for a stable release update

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Bug Description

The memcache signing middleware in python-keystoneclient is improperly implemented, such that it does not provide the advertised data integrity features. An attacker with access to the memcache instance used as a cache could insert false or changed data which would be silently accepted by the client.

<https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/memcache_crypt.py>

When the 'MAC' security strategy is enabled, the middleware falls through to silently trusting data which is missing the "MAC\_MARKER" prefix. When this mode is enabled, the middleware should require all data to be signed, and raise an error when encountering unsigned or incorrectly signed data.

Furthermore, the construction of the MAC:

h(data || token)

is improper, accepting attacker generated signatures with trivial effort since it involves no data which is not available to an attacker.

Instead, it should use the standard HMAC construction:

HMAC (K,m) = H ((K ⊕ opad) ∥ H ((K ⊕ ipad) ∥ m))

where K is a secret key, m is the message, and opad and ipad are standard constants.

The secret key should be produced using an approved key derivation function which differs from the key used when the 'ENCRYPTION' security strategy is in use. More details on appropriate functions are available in NIST Special Publication 800-108.

As currently written, this feature provides no security benefits whatsoever. I will be proposing a patch later today to fix the issues outlined above. I plan to fix this issue in a forwards-compatible way, with the side effect of invalidating existing ephemeral cache values for users who enabled this feature. This should have a CVE. I'm ok with marking this bug as public given the minimal potential for exploitation (an attacker needs access to the memcache instance, which should never happen in a proper deployment) and the assumed low usage rate of this feature.

Good one! Yes, we should get absolutely get rid of the marker checking logic. Error out if we can't verify or decrypt data.

Fix memcache encryption middleware

    middleware to not do dangerous things. It is forward compatible, but
