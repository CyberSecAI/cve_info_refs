{
  "CVE-2013-2167": {
    "description": "python-keystoneclient version 0.2.3 to 0.2.5 has middleware memcache signing bypass",
    "affected_components": [
      "python-keystoneclient middleware"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The memcache signing middleware in python-keystoneclient was improperly implemented. It did not properly verify the signature of data retrieved from memcache, allowing an attacker to insert malicious, unsigned data. The MAC was constructed using `h(data || token)` which could be easily forged.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper Authentication",
      "Signature bypass",
       "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the signing security strategy that was specified.  This could compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM)",
      "Direct access to memcache backend"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs direct write access to the memcache backend, or be in a man-in-the-middle position to intercept and modify network traffic.",
    "additional_information": "Only setups that make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers) and using `MAC` as their `memcache_security_strategy` are affected.",
