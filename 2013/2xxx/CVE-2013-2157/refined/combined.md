### Bug Description

There is a security vulnerability in the LDAP module when retrieving a token while checking the credentials of a user.

If the password field is not specified, the ldap module does not do the simple\_bind and it always returns a valid connection.

curl -i <https://lxbrf17b01.cern.ch:5000/v2.0/tokens> -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"auth": {"passwordCredentials":{"username":"jcastro"}}}' --insecure

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Vary: X-Auth-Token

Content-Type: application/json

Content-Length: 223

Date: Tue, 04 Jun 2013 08:30:31 GMT

{"access": {"token": {"expires": "2013-06-05T08:30:31Z", "id": "cec066b8d1df485a9d90e25b555ac0ff"}, "serviceCatalog": [], "user": {"username": "jcastro", "roles\_links": [], "id": "jcastro", "roles": [], "name": "jcastro"}}}

There is a simple fix by checking before the get\_connection call if the user\_id and password are not empty.

The problem there is in the get\_connection part of the ldap module, if no user or password is specified it doesn't do the simple bind. So the quickest fix is to avoid call this function with empty user or password in the authenticate method.

There is another way by forcing the simple\_bind\_s when doing the authentication, but there could be users that don't use authentication and store their passwords in user ldap attributes.

+2 on the patch.

This vulnerability has limited effect, in that it will only connect as the "Manager account" which should not have any roles or groups that are used in the rest of the Keystone system.

I don't think its scope is limited, a user was able to request a token of a user on a specific tenant and then delete an instance.

Jose, is your server set up with Anonymous binding for the manager account? If so, I can see how it will pass through if borth userid and password are left off, but it should get a token for the manager account, which should not be a "real" Open Stack /Keystone account, should have no roles, and should not be an administrator.

"passwordCredentials": {"username": "\*USER1\*"}}}' Should hit the LDAP authenticate function which does:

conn = self.user.get\_connection(self.user.\_id\_to\_dn(user\_id),

                                            password)

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/identity/backends/ldap/core.py#L112>

So it should not be passed through Blankly. Thus, it should always do the simple bind.

OK, so the problem is <https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/common/ldap/core.py#L223>

Which is there to support anonymous binding for the Administrator account. If the end user skips the password, and the system is set up to do anonymous binding, then it bypasses simple bind.

Discussed it with ayoung and it seems to only affect setups where you use anonymous binding (no ldap.user or ldap.password set in the keystone configuration). Jose can you confirm that it is your case ?

Note that the last patch also removes some dead code that masked the problem: there was a get\_connection call in the identity backend that was supposed to provide protection against the anonymous bind, but A) was improperly implemented and B) bypassed.

Jose: just to make sure we cover your case... You don't do anonymous binding but you use an account with an empty password, then ? (ldap.password not set). If both ldap.user and ldap.password are set, then from our current analysis the bind with empty password should fail.

We don't use anonymous binding and the account to connect to LDAP has a password. When authenticated the password was empty not None. Then in the get\_connection function is was not replaced by LDAP\_PASSWORD and the simple\_bind was also not done.

I realize that when I was trying to obtain a quick fix and instead of 'not password', I tried 'password is None' and it was not raising the exception as it should be.

First try at an impact description, please make sure I got that right

=========================

Title: Authentication bypass when using LDAP backend

Reporter: Jose Castro Leon (CERN)

Products: Keystone

Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:

Jose Castro Leon from CERN reported a vulnerability in the way the Keystone LDAP backend authenticates users. When provided with an empty password, the backend would perform an anonymous LDAP bind that would result in successfully authenticating the user. An attacker could therefore easily impersonate and get valid tokens for any user. Only Keystone setups using LDAP authentication backend are affected.

==========================

Keystone-core, Please also +2 the proposed patch at comment 15.

Adam, if i'm not mistaken we'll need Grizzly and Folsom backports for this one (unless the dead code path was still being used at that time ?)

Reviewed patch in #15, keystone-ayoung-0005-1-Force-simple-Bind-for-authentication.patch. Looks good to me, +2

When I git apply the patch in #28, [bug-1187305](/bugs/1187305)-folsom-v1.patch, to stable/folsom,

I only get identity/backends/ldap/core.py and the change to test doesn't apply for some reason.

Looks like self.identity\_api.authenticate should be self.identity\_api.authenticate\_user...

Running tests at least once is actually a good idea before +2ing a security patch.

FYI, this doesn't seem to affect Essex since Essex lacks 0d32a417c811ce37b1b7ea1fbbc0a8376b9b3723 ("don't assume that the LDAP server require authentication") - ie, anonymous binds fail without that patch.

## Synopsis

Important: openstack-keystone security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0994)

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and various
bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
Catalog, and Policy services.

A flaw was found in the way Keystone handled LDAP (Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol) based authentication. If Keystone was configured to use
LDAP authentication, and the LDAP server was configured to allow anonymous
binds (anonymous binds is a common default), anyone able to connect to a
given service using Keystone could connect as any user, including the
admin, without supplying a password. (CVE-2013-2157)

Red Hat would like to thank Thierry Carrez of OpenStack upstream for
reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Jose Castro Leon of CERN as
the original reporter.

These updated packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2013.1.2,
which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#972660)

All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted
automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

### Bug Description

There is a security vulnerability in the LDAP module when retrieving a token while checking the credentials of a user.

If the password field is not specified, the ldap module does not do the simple\_bind and it always returns a valid connection.

curl -i <https://lxbrf17b01.cern.ch:5000/v2.0/tokens> -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"auth": {"passwordCredentials":{"username":"jcastro"}}}' --insecure

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Vary: X-Auth-Token

Content-Type: application/json

Content-Length: 223

Date: Tue, 04 Jun 2013 08:30:31 GMT

{"access": {"token": {"expires": "2013-06-05T08:30:31Z", "id": "cec066b8d1df485a9d90e25b555ac0ff"}, "serviceCatalog": [], "user": {"username": "jcastro", "roles\_links": [], "id": "jcastro", "roles": [], "name": "jcastro"}}}

The problem there is in the get\_connection part of the ldap module, if no user or password is specified it doesn't do the simple bind. So the quickest fix is to avoid call this function with empty user or password in the authenticate method.

There is another way by forcing the simple\_bind\_s when doing the authentication, but there could be users that don't use authentication and store their passwords in user ldap attributes.

+2 on the patch.

This vulnerability has limited effect, in that it will only connect as the "Manager account" which should not have any roles or groups that are used in the rest of the Keystone system.

I don't think its scope is limited, a user was able to request a token of a user on a specific tenant and then delete an instance.

Jose, is your server set up with Anonymous binding for the manager account? If so, I can see how it will pass through if borth userid and password are left off, but it should get a token for the manager account, which should not be a "real" Open Stack /Keystone account, should have no roles, and should not be an administrator.

"passwordCredentials": {"username": "\*USER1\*"}}}' Should hit the LDAP authenticate function which does:

conn = self.user.get\_connection(self.user.\_id\_to\_dn(user\_id),

                                            password)

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/identity/backends/ldap/core.py#L112>

So it should not be passed through Blankly. Thus, it should always do the simple bind.

OK, so the problem is <https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/common/ldap/core.py#L223>

Which is there to support anonymous binding for the Administrator account. If the end user skips the password, and the system is set up to do anonymous binding, then it bypasses simple bind.

Discussed it with ayoung and it seems to only affect setups where you use anonymous binding (no ldap.user or ldap.password set in the keystone configuration). Jose can you confirm that it is your case ?

Note that the last patch also removes some dead code that masked the problem: there was a get\_connection call in the identity backend that was supposed to provide protection against the anonymous bind, but A) was improperly implemented and B) bypassed.

Jose: just to make sure we cover your case... You don't do anonymous binding but you use an account with an empty password, then ? (ldap.password not set). If both ldap.user and ldap.password are set, then from our current analysis the bind with empty password should fail.

We don't use anonymous binding and the account to connect to LDAP has a password. When authenticated the password was empty not None. Then in the get\_connection function is was not replaced by LDAP\_PASSWORD and the simple\_bind was also not done.

I realize that when I was trying to obtain a quick fix and instead of 'not password', I tried 'password is None' and it was not raising the exception as it should be.

First try at an impact description, please make sure I got that right

=========================

Title: Authentication bypass when using LDAP backend

Reporter: Jose Castro Leon (CERN)

Products: Keystone

Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:

Jose Castro Leon from CERN reported a vulnerability in the way the Keystone LDAP backend authenticates users. When provided with an empty password, the backend would perform an anonymous LDAP bind that would result in successfully authenticating the user. An attacker could therefore easily impersonate and get valid tokens for any user. Only Keystone setups using LDAP authentication backend are affected.

==========================

Keystone-core, Please also +2 the proposed patch at comment 15.

Adam, if i'm not mistaken we'll need Grizzly and Folsom backports for this one (unless the dead code path was still being used at that time ?)

Looks like self.identity\_api.authenticate should be self.identity\_api.authenticate\_user...

Running tests at least once is actually a good idea before +2ing a security patch.

FYI, this doesn't seem to affect Essex since Essex lacks 0d32a417c811ce37b1b7ea1fbbc0a8376b9b3723 ("don't assume that the LDAP server require authentication") - ie, anonymous binds fail without that patch.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=971884#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-07 13:39:30 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way Keystone, a Python implementation of the OpenStack identity service API, performed user authentication when the LDAP backend was used (previously user-provided empty LDAP password resulted into an anonymous LDAP bind to be performed, resulting into successful user authentication). A remote attacker could use this flaw to obtain unauthorized access to the OpenStack functionality (user account impersonation, retrieval of valid authentication tokens).  Note: This issue solely affects only Keystone configurations using the LDAP authentication backend.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Thierry Carrez of OpenStack upstream for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Jose Castro Leon of CERN as the original issue reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=971884#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-07 13:43:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 758168](attachment.cgi?id=758168&action=diff "Proposed upstream patch for the issue against master branch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=758168&action=edit "Proposed upstream patch for the issue against master branch") Proposed upstream patch for the issue against master branch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=971884#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-07 13:44:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 758169](attachment.cgi?id=758169&action=diff "Proposed upstream patch for the issue against grizzly branch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=758169&action=edit "Proposed upstream patch for the issue against grizzly branch") Proposed upstream patch for the issue against grizzly branch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=971884#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-07 13:44:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 758170](attachment.cgi?id=758170&action=diff "Proposed upstream patch for the issue against folsom branch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=758170&action=edit "Proposed upstream patch for the issue against folsom branch") Proposed upstream patch for the issue against folsom branch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=971884#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-07 13:47:23 UTC  ``` Preliminary embargo date for this issue has been set up by OpenStack upstream to Thursday, 13-th of June 2013, 15:00 UTC time.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=971884#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-07 13:48:15 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the openstack-keystone package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17, 18, Rawhide and Fedora EPEL-6.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=971884#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-07 13:56:44 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the python-keystoneclient, as shipped with Fedora release of 17, 18, Rawhide and Fedora EPEL-6.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=971884#c10)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-06-17 08:49:43 UTC  ``` Created openstack-keystone tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 974950](show_bug.cgi?id=974950 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2157 openstack-keystone: Authentication bypass when using LDAP backend [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 974951](show_bug.cgi?id=974951 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2157 openstack-keystone: Authentication bypass when using LDAP backend [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=971884#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-27 16:47:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0994 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0994.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=971884#c12)  Fedora Update System    2013-07-12 19:37:20 UTC  ``` openstack-keystone-2012.2.4-5.el6 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 6 stable repository.

## Synopsis

Important: openstack-keystone security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1083)

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
Catalog, and Policy services.

A flaw was found in the way Keystone handled LDAP (Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol) based authentication. If Keystone was configured to use
LDAP authentication, and the LDAP server was configured to allow anonymous
binds (anonymous binds is a common default), anyone able to connect to a
given service using Keystone could connect as any user, including the
admin, without supplying a password. (CVE-2013-2157)

Red Hat would like to thank Thierry Carrez of OpenStack upstream for
reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Jose Castro Leon of CERN as
the original reporter.

All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct this issue. After installing the updated packages,
the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

Subject: [OSSA 2013-015] Authentication bypass when using LDAP backend (CVE-2013-2157)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-015
CVE: CVE-2013-2157
Date: June 13, 2013
Title: Authentication bypass when using LDAP backend
Reporter: Jose Castro Leon (CERN)
Products: Keystone
Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:
Jose Castro Leon from CERN reported a vulnerability in the way the
Keystone LDAP backend authenticates users. When provided with an empty
password, the backend would perform an anonymous LDAP bind that would
result in successfully authenticating the user. An attacker could
therefore easily impersonate and get valid tokens for any user. Only
Keystone setups using LDAP authentication backend are affected.

Havana (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/32896/>

Grizzly fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/32895/>

Folsom fix:

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
