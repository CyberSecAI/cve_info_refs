## Synopsis

Moderate: qemu-kvm-rhev security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0791)

## Topic

Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix one security issue and two bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages form the
user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

It was found that QEMU Guest Agent (the "qemu-ga" service) created
certain files with world-writable permissions when run in daemon mode
(the default mode). An unprivileged guest user could use this flaw to
consume all free space on the partition containing the qemu-ga log file, or
modify the contents of the log. When a UNIX domain socket transport was
explicitly configured to be used (not the default), an unprivileged guest
user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges in the
guest. This update requires manual action. Refer below for details.
(CVE-2013-2007)

This update does not change the permissions of the existing log file or
the UNIX domain socket. For these to be changed, stop the qemu-ga service,
and then manually remove all "group" and "other" permissions on the
affected files, or remove the files.

Note that after installing this update, files created by the
guest-file-open QEMU Monitor Protocol (QMP) command will still continue to
be created with world-writable permissions for backwards compatibility.

This issue was discovered by Laszlo Ersek of Red Hat.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, due to integer overflow in code calculations, the qemu-kvm

utility was reporting incorrect memory size on QMP events when using the
virtio balloon driver with more than 4 GB of memory. This update fixes the
overflow in the code and qemu-kvm works as expected in the described
scenario. (BZ#958750)

* When the set\_link flag is set to "off" to change the status of a network

card, the status is changed to "down" on the respective guest. Previously,
with certain network cards, when such a guest was restarted, the status of
the network card was unexpectedly reset to "up", even though the network
was unavailable. A patch has been provided to address this bug and the link
status change is now preserved across restarts for all network cards.
(BZ#927591)

All users of qemu-kvm-rhev are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After
installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all
virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=956082#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-04-24 09:30:47 UTC  ``` The upstream qemu guest agent creates files with insecure permissions when started in daemon mode, which could potentially lead local privilege escalation.  The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 qemu-ga, when started in daemon mode, creates logfiles in /var/log/ world writable allowing any one on the system to wipe the contents of the log file or to store data within the log file. An unprivileged guest user could use this flaw to consume all free space on the partition with qemu-ga log file, or modify the contents of the log. When a UNIX domain socket transport were explicitly configured to be used (non-default), an unprivileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges in the guest.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Laszlo Ersek of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=956082#c2)  Petr Matousek    2013-04-24 09:41:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue does not affect the xen package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue does affect the qemu-kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Future qemu-kvm updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.  Please note that due to differences in upstream and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 versions of qemu guest agent this issue has lower security impact on systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=956082#c6)  Laszlo Ersek    2013-04-24 11:19:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 739402](attachment.cgi?id=739402&action=diff "[PATCH] qga: set umask 0077 when daemonizing") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=739402&action=edit "[PATCH] qga: set umask 0077 when daemonizing") [PATCH] qga: set umask 0077 when daemonizing  The qemu guest agent creates a bunch of files with insecure permissions when started in daemon mode.

openSUSE Security Update: qemu
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2013:1202-1
Rating: moderate
References: #818181
Cross-References: CVE-2013-2007
Affected Products:
openSUSE 12.3
openSUSE 12.2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
The qemu guest agent creates a bunch of files with insecure
permissions when started in daemon mode. For now mask all
file mode bits for "group" and "others" in become\_daemon().
Temporarily, for compatibility reasons, stick with the 0666
file-mode in case of files newly created by the
"guest-file-open" QMP call. Do so without changing the
umask temporarily.
QEMU was updated to 1.1.2 on openSUSE 12.2, and 1.3.1 on
openSUSE 12.3.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 12.3:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2013-588
- openSUSE 12.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2013-588
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0896)

## Topic

Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix one security issue and two bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. qemu-kvm is the user-space component
for running virtual machines using KVM.

It was found that QEMU Guest Agent (the "qemu-ga" service) created
certain files with world-writable permissions when run in daemon mode
(the default mode). An unprivileged guest user could use this flaw to
consume all free space on the partition containing the qemu-ga log file, or
modify the contents of the log. When a UNIX domain socket transport was
explicitly configured to be used (not the default), an unprivileged guest
user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges in the
guest. This update requires manual action. Refer below for details.
(CVE-2013-2007)

This update does not change the permissions of the existing log file or
the UNIX domain socket. For these to be changed, stop the qemu-ga service,
and then manually remove all "group" and "other" permissions on the
affected files, or remove the files.

Note that after installing this update, files created by the
guest-file-open QEMU Monitor Protocol (QMP) command will still continue to
be created with world-writable permissions for backwards compatibility.

This issue was discovered by Laszlo Ersek of Red Hat.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, due to integer overflow in code calculations, the qemu-kvm

utility was reporting incorrect memory size on QMP events when using the
virtio balloon driver with more than 4 GB of memory. This update fixes the
overflow in the code and qemu-kvm works as expected in the described
scenario. (BZ#958750)

* When the set\_link flag is set to "off" to change the status of a network

card, the status is changed to "down" on the respective guest. Previously,
with certain network cards, when such a guest was restarted, the status of
the network card was unexpectedly reset to "up", even though the network
was unavailable. A patch has been provided to address this bug and the link
status change is now preserved across restarts for all network cards.
(BZ#927591)

All users of qemu-kvm should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 51 (CVE-2013-2007) - qemu guest agent (qga)
 insecure file permissions

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-2007 / XSA-51
                              version 2

           qemu guest agent (qga) insecure file permissions

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The qemu guest agent creates files with insecure permissions when
started in daemon mode.

IMPACT
======

The qemu guest agent is not used by default in Xen systems.

If it is used in a particular guest, unprivileged guest processes
might be able to escalate their privilege to that of the guest.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

We are not aware of any Xen installations using the qemu guest agent.

However, the program is built and installed (as the executable
`qemu-ga') as part of the Xen management tools by the Xen build
system.  It is possible that a system administrator, or downstream
system integrator, might have arranged to execute qemu-ga.

If you have not taken steps to run qemu-ga, you are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Disabling the guest agent will eliminate the vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Patches to resolve this problem are available from the upstream qemu
project via the usual channels.  The Xen Project Security Team do not
intend to provide or distribute patches for this vulnerability.

DETAILS
=======

At the time of writing the information we have about this
vulnerability is as follows:

  Subject: [PATCH] qga: set umask 0077 when daemonizing (CVE-2013-2007)

  The qemu guest agent creates a bunch of files with insecure permissions
  when started in daemon mode. For example:

    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root /var/log/qemu-ga.log
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root /var/run/qga.state
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root /var/log/qga-fsfreeze-hook.log

  In addition, at least all files created with the "guest-file-open" QMP
  command, and all files created with shell output redirection (or
  otherwise) by utilities invoked by the fsfreeze hook script are affected.

  ...

For authoritative further information, and patches, please refer to
the information provided by the qemu upstream project.
