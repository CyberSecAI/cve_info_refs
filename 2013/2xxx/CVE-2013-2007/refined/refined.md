  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2013-2007",
    "description": "The QEMU Guest Agent (qemu-ga) creates certain files with world-writable permissions when run in daemon mode. An unprivileged guest user could use this to consume disk space or modify logs. When a UNIX domain socket transport was explicitly configured (not default), an unprivileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges within the guest.",
    "root_cause": "The qemu guest agent creates files with insecure permissions when started in daemon mode. Specifically, the agent does not properly set the umask during daemonization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file permissions (world-writable)"
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged guest user can cause a denial-of-service by filling up the disk with log files, modify log file contents, and potentially escalate privileges within the guest when a UNIX domain socket transport is configured.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting world-writable log files",
      "Exploiting world-writable UNIX domain socket (if configured)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unprivileged user within the guest operating system. For privilege escalation, a non-default configuration with a UNIX domain socket is needed.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was addressed by setting the umask to 0077 before creating files in daemon mode. The fix did not change existing files and therefore the existing logfiles permissions need to be manually changed to remove group and other write permission. Additionally, the guest-file-open QMP command continues to create files with world writable permissions for backwards compatibility."
