### CVE-2013-2896

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** NULL pointer dereference
*   **Affected Software:** Linux kernel's Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem, specifically the N-Trig touch screen driver (CONFIG\_HID\_NTRIG).
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability occurs when the ntrig HID driver receives a malicious output report from an HID device. During the `ntrig_probe` function, a NULL pointer dereference can be triggered.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local attacker with physical access to the system can exploit this vulnerability by connecting a specially crafted HID device (e.g., a malicious touch screen) to the system.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to a kernel crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).
*   **Affected Configurations:** Systems with the Human Interface Device bus (CONFIG\_HID) and the N-Trig touch screen driver (CONFIG\_HID\_NTRIG) enabled are vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:** Apply the patch referenced in the marc.info link provided, or update to a kernel version containing the fix.
*   **Red Hat's Assessment:** Red Hat rated this as having a "Moderate" severity. The advisory notes that physical access is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ubuntu's Assessment:** Ubuntu also identifies this as a vulnerability in their security notices related to the Linux kernel, specifically mentioning the possibility of a denial of service (OOPS).

The patch included in the `marc.info` content adds a check to ensure that the `report` pointer, the `report->maxfield`, and `report->field[0]->report_count` are valid before proceeding, preventing the NULL pointer dereference.
