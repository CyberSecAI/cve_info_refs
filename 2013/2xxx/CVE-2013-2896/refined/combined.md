Subject: Linux HID security flaws

Hi,

I've found several issues in the Linux HID code. They are making their way
into the Linux kernel via the linux-input tree now:

<http://marc.info/?l=linux-input&m=137772180514608&w=1>
0001-HID-validate-HID-report-id-size.patch
CVE-2013-2888
Requires CONFIG_HID
Memory write via arbitrary heap array index. This is the most serious,
IMO, as it allows (on 32-bit) access to the entire memory range (the
index is unsigned 32 bit). This is mitigated slightly by the fact that
the starting address is at an "unknown" location on the heap, and that
the value written is an "arbitrary" kernel pointer. Still, this could
almost certainly be turned into full kernel execution given enough
study.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1490)

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way IP packets with an Internet Header Length

(ihl) of zero were processed in the skb\_flow\_dissect() function in the
Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger an infinite
loop in the kernel, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4348,
Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-4387, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the creation of

temporary IPv6 addresses. If the IPv6 privacy extension was enabled
(/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use\_tempaddr set to '2'), an attacker on
the local network could disable IPv6 temporary address generation, leading
to a potential information disclosure. (CVE-2013-0343, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled HID (Human Interface

Device) reports with an out-of-bounds Report ID. An attacker with physical
access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888,
Moderate)

* Heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the

Pantherlord/GreenAsia game controller driver, the Logitech force feedback
drivers, and the Logitech Unifying receivers driver handled HID reports.
An attacker with physical access to the system could use these flaws to
crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-2892, CVE-2013-2893, CVE-2013-2895, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the N-Trig touch

screen driver handled HID reports. An attacker with physical access to the
system could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2013-2896, Moderate)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's device

mapper subsystem, under certain conditions, interpreted data written to
snapshot block devices. An attacker could use this flaw to read data from
disk blocks in free space, which are normally inaccessible. (CVE-2013-4299,
Moderate)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the tun\_set\_iff() function in the

Universal TUN/TAP device driver implementation in the Linux kernel.
A privileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
further escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4343, Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in

the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead
to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected
when ANSI CPRNG was used. (CVE-2013-4345, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 SCTP implementation

interacted with the IPsec subsystem. This resulted in unencrypted SCTP
packets being sent over the network even though IPsec encryption was
enabled. An attacker able to inspect these SCTP packets could use this flaw
to obtain potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-4350, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Fujitsu for reporting CVE-2013-4299 and Stephan
Mueller for reporting CVE-2013-4345. The CVE-2013-4348 issue was discovered
by Jason Wang of Red Hat.

Bug fix:

* RoCE appeared to be supported in the MRG Realtime kernel even when the

required user space packages from the HPN channel were not installed.
The Realtime kernel now checks for the HPN channel packages before exposing
the RoCE interfaces. RoCE devices appear as plain 10GigE devices if the
needed HPN channel user space packages are not installed. (BZ#1012993)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
kernel to version kernel-rt-3.8.13-rt14, and correct these issues.
The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-235-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-235.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-235.51)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1441-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1441.60](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1441.60)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-235-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-235.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-235.51)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when reading

broadcast messages from the notify\_policy interface of the IPSec

key\_socket. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially

sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2237](/security/CVE-2013-2237))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Human

Interface Device (HID) subsystem when CONFIG\_HID\_SENSOR\_HUB is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory via a specially crafted device.

([CVE-2013-2898](/security/CVE-2013-2898))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux Kernel's networking stack checks scm

credentials when used with namespaces. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-4300](/security/CVE-2013-4300))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-32-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.8.0-32.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.8.0-32.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-raring](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-raring) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Raring

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when reading

broadcast messages from the notify\_policy interface of the IPSec

key\_socket. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially

sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2237](/security/CVE-2013-2237))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Human

Interface Device (HID) subsystem when CONFIG\_HID\_SENSOR\_HUB is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory via a specially crafted device.

([CVE-2013-2898](/security/CVE-2013-2898))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux Kernel's networking stack checks scm

credentials when used with namespaces. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-4300](/security/CVE-2013-4300))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-32-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-32.47~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-32.47~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-09-04 09:08:47 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's device-mapper subsystem, under certain conditions, interpreted data written to snapshot block devices. Snapshots are constructed from a single "cow" (copy-on-write) device that contains a mixture of data and metadata, and the bug involves a user writing a data block that is later incorrectly interpreted as metadata controlling how blocks are mapped.  An attacker could construct a mapping to read data from disk blocks in 'free space' that is normally inaccessible.  Please note that apart from having security consequences (data leak), this bug is also a data corruptor.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Fujitsu for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c15)  Alasdair Kergon     2013-10-16 12:28:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 812893](attachment.cgi?id=812893&action=diff "Patch proposed for upstream kernels") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=812893&action=edit "Patch proposed for upstream kernels") Patch proposed for upstream kernels   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-16 17:21:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1436 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1436.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c17)  Alasdair Kergon     2013-10-18 01:38:52 UTC  ``` Links to upstream merge:  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e9c6a182649f4259db704ae15a91ac820e63b0ca>  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8359ffa56595b5b56ea690810cace53e13618269>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-22 17:04:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2013:1450 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1450.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-22 17:33:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:1449 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1449.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-31 16:29:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2013:1490 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1490.html>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-13 18:54:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2013:1519 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1519.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-14 17:41:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:1520 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1520.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-12-05 17:10:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2013:1783 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1783.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-12-19 21:29:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:1860 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1860.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1000494#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-08-23 14:21:22 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the Human Interface Device bus(CONFIG_HID) along with the N-Trig touch screen driver(CONFIG_HID_NTRIG) support is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw. It could occur when an HID device sends malicious output report to the ntrig kernel driver.  A local user with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the kernel resulting in DoS.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1000494#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2013-08-23 14:25:52 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  This issue affects the version of the kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 may address this issue.  Note: user would need physical access to the system to exploit this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1000494#c5)  Prasad Pandit    2013-08-29 13:50:43 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1002594](show_bug.cgi?id=1002594 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2896 Kernel: HID: ntrig: NULL pointer dereference [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1000494#c6)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-13 01:05:08 UTC  ``` kernel-3.10.11-200.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-43-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-43.66~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-43.66~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Dan Carpenter discovered an information leak in the HP Smart Array and

Compaq SMART2 disk-array driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-2147](/security/CVE-2013-2147))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](/security/CVE-2013-4470))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-236-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-236.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-236.52)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
