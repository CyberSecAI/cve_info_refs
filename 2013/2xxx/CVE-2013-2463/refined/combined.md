## Description

```
Multiple flaws were discovered in the ImagingLib and the image attribute,
channel, layout and raster processing in the 2D component. An untrusted
Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java
Virtual Machine memory corruption (CVE-2013-2470, CVE-2013-2471,
CVE-2013-2472, CVE-2013-2473, CVE-2013-2463, CVE-2013-2465, CVE-2013-2469).

Integer overflow flaws were found in the way AWT processed certain input.
An attacker could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running an untrusted Java applet or application
(CVE-2013-2459).

Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Sound,
JDBC, Libraries, JMX, and Serviceability components in OpenJDK. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java
sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-2448, CVE-2013-2454, CVE-2013-2458,
CVE-2013-2457, CVE-2013-2453, CVE-2013-2460).

Multiple flaws in the Serialization, Networking, Libraries and CORBA
components can be exploited by an untrusted Java application or applet to
gain access to potentially sensitive information (CVE-2013-2456,
CVE-2013-2447, CVE-2013-2455, CVE-2013-2452, CVE-2013-2443, CVE-2013-2446).

It was discovered that the Hotspot component did not properly handle
out-of-memory errors. An untrusted Java application or applet could
possibly use these flaws to terminate the Java Virtual Machine
(CVE-2013-2445).

It was discovered that the AWT component did not properly manage certain
resources and that the ObjectStreamClass of the Serialization component
did not properly handle circular references. An untrusted Java application
or applet could possibly use these flaws to cause a denial of service
(CVE-2013-2444, CVE-2013-2450).

It was discovered that the Libraries component contained certain errors
related to XML security and the class loader. A remote attacker could
possibly exploit these flaws to bypass intended security mechanisms or
disclose potentially sensitive information and cause a denial of service
(CVE-2013-2407, CVE-2013-2461).

It was discovered that JConsole did not properly inform the user when
establishing an SSL connection failed. An attacker could exploit this flaw
to gain access to potentially sensitive information (CVE-2013-2412).

It was discovered that GnomeFileTypeDetector did not check for read
permissions when accessing files. An untrusted Java application or applet
could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information
(CVE-2013-2449).

It was found that documentation generated by Javadoc was vulnerable to a
frame injection attack. If such documentation was accessible over a
network, and a remote attacker could trick a user into visiting a
specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web content being
displayed next to the documentation. This could be used to perform a
phishing attack by providing frame content that spoofed a login form on
the site hosting the vulnerable documentation (CVE-2013-1571).

It was discovered that the 2D component created shared memory segments with
insecure permissions. A local attacker could use this flaw to read or write
to the shared memory segment (CVE-2013-1500).

Additionally, this OpenJDK update causes icedtea-web, the Java browser
plugin, to crash, so icedtea-web has been patched to fix this on Mageia 3.

Note that on Mageia 2, icedtea-web uses java-1.6.0-openjdk, which has not
yet been updated to fix these security issues.  An ETA for that update is
not known at this time.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-ibm packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

This update corrects several security vulnerabilities in the IBM Java
Runtime Environment shipped as part of Red Hat Network Satellite Server
5.4. In a typical operating environment, these are of low security risk as
the runtime is not used on untrusted applets.

Several flaws were fixed in the IBM Java 2 Runtime Environment.

Alert
# Oracle Releases Updates for Javadoc and Other Java SE Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedOctober 07, 2016
Alert CodeTA13-169A

### Systems Affected

Any system using Oracle Java including

* JDK and JRE 7 Update 21 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 6 Update 45 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 45 and earlier
* JavaFX 2.2.21 and earlier

Website owners that host Javadoc HTML API documentation

### Overview

Oracle released the [June 2013 Critical Patch Update for Oracle Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujun2013-1899847.html). This patch contains 40 new security fixes across Java SE products and a fix to the [Javadoc Tool](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html). API documentation in HTML format generated by the Javadoc tool that contains a right frame may be vulnerable to frame injection when hosted on a web server.

Oracle's June Critical Patch Update includes a fix to the [Javadoc Tool](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html). API documentation in HTML format generated by the Javadoc tool that contains a right frame may be vulnerable to frame injection when hosted on a web server. Additional information can be found in [CERT Vulnerablity Report VU#225657](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/225657). It is recommened that sites hosting such pages should re-generate the API documentation using the latest Javadoc tool and replace the current pages with the re-generated Javadoc output. In cases where regenerating API documentation is not feasible, a Java API Documentation Updater Tool that updates API documentation "in place" is available [Oracle's Java SE Downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

### Impact

An attacker can cause one of the frames within a Javadoc-generated web page to be replaced with a malicious page. This vulnerability could be used for phishing or social engineering, or it could be used for browser exploitation if combined with another browser-related vulnerability.

### Solution

**Apply Updates**

Oracle has released the [June 2013 Java Critical Patch Update](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujun2013-1899847.html) to address this vulnerability. Oracle Java Development Toolkit (JDK) and Javadoc users are advised to apply the [June 2013 Java Critical Patch Update](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujun2013-1899847.html) and regenerate and republish affected Javadoc HTML pages.

**Fix-in-Place Tool**

Oracle has released a fix-in-place tool named [Java API Documentation Updater Tool](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html). This fix-in-place tool can process directories or folders to search for HTML files to be remediated without having to regenerate existing Javadocs. When presented directories/folders and their sub-directories or sub-folders, the [Java API Documentation Updater Tool](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html) will search for files with the following names:

* index.htm
* index.html
* toc.htm
* toc.html

For each file that matches the names noted above, the [Java API Documentation Updater Tool](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html) will search the file for the affected JavaScript text and replace it with the remediated version. Note that this tool will not detect Javadoc pages that have been renamed to something other than one of the above page names.
