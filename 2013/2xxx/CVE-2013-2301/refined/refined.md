Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect access permissions for certain files within the OpenWnn for Android application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Permissions:** The core issue is that the file access permissions are not correctly configured, allowing other applications to access files they should not be able to. This is categorized as CWE-264: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious Android application can exploit the permission issue to gain unauthorized access to information managed by OpenWnn. This could potentially expose sensitive user data handled by the IME.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Application:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious Android application installed on the same device as the vulnerable OpenWnn instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Application Installation:** The attacker must trick the user into installing a malicious application.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without needing to authenticate to the vulnerable application or system. The JPCERT/CC analysis notes this as "anonymous or no authentication".
- **Network Access:** While the vulnerability is local in nature (requiring another app on the same device), the analysis notes the "Access Required" as "can be attacked over the internet using packets". The "packets" could be misleading since no network interaction with the vulnerable app is actually needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenWnn for Android version 1.3.5 and earlier.
- The issue is fixed in version 1.3.6, which was released with Android 4.0 (ICS) support.
- The CVSS v2 score is 2.6 (Low), because while an attacker can achieve partial Confidentiality Impact, the Access Complexity is High. This means exploiting it is not easy.
- A workaround is provided by the vendor, which is to stop using OpenWnn for Android and use another IME software.
