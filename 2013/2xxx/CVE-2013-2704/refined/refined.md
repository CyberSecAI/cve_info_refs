Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security issue related to the "dropdown-menu-widget" WordPress plugin:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The plugin was closed due to a "Security Issue." The specific nature of the vulnerability isn't detailed in the provided text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The text only states "Security Issue" as the reason for the plugin's closure without providing specific details on the weakness.
*   There are mentions of PHP strict errors, which might be indicative of poorly written code that could be vulnerable or lead to other issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The text does not specify the impact of exploitation.
*   Given the nature of WordPress plugins and the fact that it's a menu widget, potential impacts might range from:
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the plugin handles user input incorrectly.
    *   Access control bypass if not configured correctly.
    *   Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the plugin has vulnerabilities in its handling of user input.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Since the exact vulnerability isn't specified, a variety of attack vectors could be possible:
    *   Exploiting input sanitization issues.
    *   Leveraging vulnerabilities in the plugin's parsing or processing of menu configuration.
    *   Attacking through XSS by injecting malicious scripts.
    *  Potentially exploiting PHP strict error by manipulating input parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to target a WordPress site that had this plugin installed (although it's now closed and not available for download).
*   Depending on the nature of the exploit, an attacker might need to:
    *   Be able to interact with the plugin's interface,
    *   Gain access to the WordPress backend.
    *   Have network access to the site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download, which suggests the vulnerability was severe enough to warrant its removal.
*   The lack of detailed information about the vulnerability makes it difficult to assess the full scope of the issue.
*   The information suggests that the plugin had some code quality issues (PHP strict errors), which could have contributed to the security vulnerability.

**Summary of Findings**

The provided content indicates a critical security issue in the "dropdown-menu-widget" WordPress plugin leading to its closure, but does not specify the vulnerability details. The plugin could have been vulnerable to XSS, access control bypass, RCE, or other potential attacks due to poorly written code. An attacker could have exploited these issues through various means, requiring some level of access to the WordPress site.
