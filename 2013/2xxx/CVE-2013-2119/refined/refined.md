Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `rubygem-passenger` gem, when used in standalone mode, creates temporary files and directories in an insecure manner. Specifically, the `create_nginx_controller` function in `lib/phusion_passenger/standalone/main.rb` creates an nginx configuration file and a temporary directory in `/tmp` using a predictable name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The application uses a predictable name for temporary directories and files created in `/tmp`. Specifically:
    ```
    @temp_dir        = "/tmp/passenger-standalone.#{$$}"
    @config_filename = "#{@temp_dir}/config"
    ```
    where `$$` is the process ID.
*   **Lack of Proper Permissions:** The insecurely created temporary directory and configuration file are potentially vulnerable to access by other local users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker could create the temporary directory and configuration file before `passenger` does. If the attacker provides a crafted configuration file, it can lead to a denial-of-service for the legitimate service.
*   **Local Root Compromise:** If `passenger` is executed as root (e.g. to allow nginx to listen on port 80), an attacker could potentially supply a custom nginx configuration file and thus control the nginx instance, leading to a local root compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** A local user with the ability to create files and directories in `/tmp` can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create files and directories in `/tmp` with write access to the files and directories the `passenger` gem is creating.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions 3.0.17 and 4.0.3 of the passenger rubygem.
*   The issue was fixed in versions 3.0.21 and 4.0.5 of `rubygem-passenger`.
*   The fix involves making the creation of temporary files and directories more secure.
*   Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise uses polyinstantiation for `/tmp`, which reduces but does not eliminate the risk.
*   The issue was discovered by Michael Scherer of the Red Hat Regional IT team.
*   The fix was released in Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2013:1136.
