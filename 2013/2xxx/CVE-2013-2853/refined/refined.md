```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The HTTPS implementation in Chromium does not validate if headers are terminated with \r\n\r\n.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper header termination validation, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially perform man-in-the-middle attacks by injecting malicious data into the header stream.
- Attack vectors: Man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between the client and the server.
