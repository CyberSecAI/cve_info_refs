{
  "cve": "CVE-2013-2190",
  "description": "The vulnerability is due to improper handling of hierarchy events in the Clutter library, specifically when an underlying device disappears, causing an error during the XIQueryDevice query. This can lead to a gnome-shell crash after system resume.",
  "affected_components": [
    "clutter",
    "gnome-shell"
  ],
  "root_cause": "Improper translation of hierarchy events in the Clutter library when an underlying device disappears, leading to an error during XIQueryDevice.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "The Clutter library fails to properly handle errors during XIQueryDevice calls when devices disappear.",
    "This causes a crash in gnome-shell when the system resumes from suspend or hibernate, due to a failure in processing device events."
  ],
  "impact": "A physically proximate attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to a gnome-shell session immediately after system resume. This occurs because the screen lock is bypassed when gnome-shell crashes, dropping the user into the pre-existing X session.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Physical proximity to the target device.",
    "Triggering a device disconnection during system resume."
  ],
   "required_capabilities": [
    "Ability to cause a device to disappear during system resume",
     "Physical proximity to the target device"
  ],
  "additional_details": [
    "The vulnerability is triggered when `XIQueryDevice` throws an error due to a device disappearing.",
    "The issue was introduced by the commit `1b1e77b46989ba97bfff8abdfa61df0f514a7eae` in the Clutter library.",
    "The fix involves trapping errors when calling `XIQueryDevice` and is available in Clutter versions 1.14 and 1.16."
