Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-2484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The CIMD dissector in Wireshark has a flaw that can cause a crash due to a malformed packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the CIMD dissector's handling of malformed packets. It appears that certain malformed packets can trigger a crash within the dissector, indicating a parsing or memory access issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash.
-  The crash can occur when reading a malformed packet trace file or by injecting a malformed packet onto the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by:
    - Injecting a malformed CIMD packet onto the network being monitored by Wireshark.
    - Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file (.pcap) containing a specially crafted CIMD packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to either:
    - Inject network traffic into a network being analyzed by Wireshark.
    - Send a malicious .pcap file to a user who is likely to open it in Wireshark.
- No special privileges are required for the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified by the Wireshark security advisory **wnpa-sec-2013-19.**
- It affects Wireshark versions 1.8.0 to 1.8.5 and 1.6.0 to 1.6.13.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Moshe Kaplan.
- The fix is included in Wireshark versions 1.8.6 and 1.6.14.
- A .pcap file ("cimd.pcap") has been provided which can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
