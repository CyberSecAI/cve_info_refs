Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2059:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that when a user is deleted using the Keystone v2 API, the existing authentication tokens associated with that user are not immediately invalidated. These tokens remain valid until their natural expiration, which is by default 24 hours.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Token Revocation:** The core issue is the lack of immediate token revocation upon user deletion through the v2 API. This means that even after an administrator deletes a user, the user could still access resources with their existing tokens.
*   **Token Caching:** The auth\_token middleware caches the tokens to improve performance which results in a delay before a revocation event is noticed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A deleted user can retain access to the system and its resources for up to 24 hours (or the configured token expiration time) using previously issued valid tokens.
*   **Privilege Persistence:** This can allow a user who should no longer have access to continue performing actions, creating resources or doing anything their token would allow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Interaction:** An attacker with a valid user account could potentially exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Admin-Initiated User Deletion:** The vulnerability is triggered by an administrator deleting a user via the Keystone v2 API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must have had a valid user account before being deleted.
*   **Existing Token:** The attacker needs to possess a valid token issued before their deletion.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware that their token will remain valid even after their account has been deleted, and they need to act before the token expires.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the Keystone v2 API user deletion process.
*   Keystone setups using the v3 API to delete users are not affected.
*   Disabling a user prior to deletion invalidates their tokens immediately, providing a workaround.
*   Both UUID and PKI tokens are affected.
*   The token validity is configurable via the keystone.conf \[token] expiration setting (default 24 hours).
*   The token caching time can be configured in the auth\_token middleware initialization.
*   Patches were released for Havana, Grizzly, Folsom and Essex.
