How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-011
CVE: CVE-2013-2059
Date: May 9, 2013
Title: Keystone tokens not immediately invalidated when user is deleted
Reporter: Sam Stoelinga
Products: Keystone
Affects: All versions

Description:
Sam Stoelinga reported a vulnerability in Keystone. When users are
deleted through Keystone v2 API, existing tokens for those users are not
immediately invalidated and remain valid for the duration of the token's
life (by default, up to 24 hours). This may result in users retaining
access when the administrator of the system thought them disabled. You
can workaround this issue by disabling a user before deleting it: in
that case the tokens belonging to the disabled user are immediately
invalidated. Keystone setups using the v3 API call to delete users are
unaffected.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Description:

A deleted user is still able to create instances and do other stuff if he's still logged in.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Login with admin user in Chrome

2. Login with demo user in Firefox

3. Use the admin user to delete the demo user

4. Go back to firefox and use the demo user to create an instance for example

Current result:

Demo user in firefox stays logged in and can create instances, but I guess he can do anything he want with his token

Expected result:

Demo user shouldn't be able to still create instances, or do other stuff. Instead he should be automatically logged out as soon as we notice that he's already deleted.

Not really a Horizon issue, switching to Keystone.

I think this is by design how tokens work, but I will ask for keystone core confirmation first.

Deleting a user should result in all of the user's tokens being revoked, which should be recognized by the auth\_token middleware (either by revocation list for PKI or by calling keystone per token for UUID), causing subsequent requests by the user to result in 401's.

Can you confirm:

- which type of tokens are in use, UUID or PKI?

- which middleware is protecting nova? keystone.middleware.auth\_token or keystoneclient.middleware.auth\_token?

- how is the middleware configured? specifically interested in revocation\_cache\_time if set, which should default to 1 second

- which release/branch of keystone is this occurring on?

For PKI token (the default in Grizzly), there will be a time delay between the revocation and the fetch of the revocation list. This is expected and as designed. The time delay can be set as low as desired.

Still trying to make up my mind whether to consider this a "vulnerability".

I suspect those tokens end up being denied after their validity period ? Is there a way for the admin to disable the tokens manually ?

Is that only affecting Folsom ?

I'm leaning towards yes.

I don't believe that option existing in Folsom - UUID tokens should be denied immediately.

> Is there a way for the admin to disable the tokens manually?

Yes, you can delete tokens one at a time if you know the token ( DELETE :35357/v2.0/tokens/{token\_id} )

My guess is that there is a difference in behavior between disabling a user and deleting a user (both should result in all associated tokens being revoked). As a workaround, I'd suggest disabling the user prior to deletion.

> Is that only affecting Folsom?

Probably, but grizzly needs to be tested as well.

UUID Tokens are authenticated via an online call to Keystone. Once that has been done,. they are cached inside auth\_token middleware. The is is a performance optimization. In order to perform and additional lookup against Keystone, set the cache value lower. So the trade off is between a performance optimization and immediate notification of a revocation event. The solution to this is to shorten the time UUID tokens are in the cache.

We default this value in the auth\_token middleware initialization.

    cfg.IntOpt('token\_cache\_time', default=300), With the time in seconds, 300 means five minutes. This seems like a reasonable trade-off. We can choose a shorter default. And installations can configure this value with the application paste files.

I'm not clear on whether this should be impacted by token\_cache\_time (default=300 seconds) or revocation\_cache\_time (default=1 second)

Either way, I'd like to attempt to reproduce with default settings and try turning down the token\_cache\_time before changing the status of the bug.

I see that delete\_user is not in the Identity manager, but is rather implemented by the individual backends. I suspect that they are not correctly propagating a token revocation event upon deletion:

A quick brows of the code seems to validate this:

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/identity/backends/sql.py#L760>

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/identity/backends/ldap/core.py#L215>

The controller call is

def delete\_user(self, context, user\_id):

        self.assert\_admin(context)

        self.identity\_api.delete\_user(context, user\_id)

Where as the call set\_user\_enabled calls update\_user has a call self.\_delete\_tokens\_for\_user(context, user\_id)

It looks like the fix is to put code into the manager, roughly here:

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/identity/core.py#L84>

That calls the underlying driver's delete\_user code, and then deletes the tokens for the user.

Or add a call to

            self.\_delete\_tokens\_for\_user(context, user\_id)

in delete\_use

About impact, let me make sure I understand this correctly: when users are deleted, their existing tokens are not invalidated, so they stay valid for the duration of the token life ? What is the default lifetime for a token ? Which types of tokens are affected ?

As an aside, we have this covered for the v3 api, it is just the v2 api that has the issue (i.e. the controller code that responds to the v3 delete user call already has the call to invalidate the tokens). So people calling the v3 api are not subject to this vulnerability.

1) When users are deleted, their existing tokens are not invalidated, so they stay valid for the duration of the token life ? Yes, the workaround here is to disable the user prior to deleting them, which will result in tokens being revoked as expected.

2) What is the default lifetime for a token? 24 hours; this is configurable via keystone.conf [token] expiration (defaults to 86400 seconds)

3) Which types of tokens are affected? PKI and UUID, both.

And as henry-nash pointed out, this only affects the delete user call on the v2 API, but both APIs will continue to validate pre-existing tokens. After a user is either disabled or deleted, they are not able to generate new tokens.

Here is proposed impact description, please doublecheck.

@Sam, do you want us to credit a specific company for the discovery, in addition to your name ?

================================================

Title: Keystone tokens not immediately invalidated when user is deleted

Reporter: Sam Stoelinga

Products: Keystone

Affects: All versions

Description:

Sam Stoelinga reported a vulnerability in Keystone. When users are deleted through Keystone v2 API, existing tokens for those users are not immediately invalidated and remain valid for the duration of the token's life (by default, up to 24 hours). This may result in users retaining access when the administrator of the system thought them disabled. Keystone setups using the v3 API call to delete users are unaffected. You can workaround this issue by disabling a user before deleting it: in that case the tokens belonging to the disabled user are immediately invalidated.

Looks good - although maybe move the workaround description before the sentence where we say that v3 is unaffected - making it more obvious that you only need the workaround for v2.

When users are deleted through Keystone v2 API, existing tokens for those users are not immediately invalidated and remain valid for the duration of the token's life (by default, up to 24 hours). This may result in users retaining access when the administrator of the system thought them disabled. Keystone setups using the v3 API call to delete users are unaffected. You can workaround this issue by disabling a user before deleting it: in that case the tokens belonging to the disabled user are immediately invalidated.

Title: Keystone tokens not immediately invalidated when user is deleted

Reporter: Sam Stoelinga

Products: Keystone

Affects: All versions

Description:

Sam Stoelinga reported a vulnerability in Keystone. When users are deleted through Keystone v2 API, existing tokens for those users are not immediately invalidated and remain valid for the duration of the token's life (by default, up to 24 hours). This may result in users retaining access when the administrator of the system thought them disabled. You can workaround this issue by disabling a user before deleting it: in that case the tokens belonging to the disabled user are immediately invalidated. Keystone setups using the v3 API call to delete users are unaffected.

Also we need a Grizzly backport for the master patch (probably easy) and potentially a Folsom backport if Folsom is affected.

I reviewed the 3 patches:

 [bug-1166670](/bugs/1166670)-grizzly-v1

 [bug-1166670](/bugs/1166670)-folsom-v1

and they all look like they fix the problem and are correct.

One nit, in folsom, I think the text should be:

            LOG.warning('User %s has been deleted, but existing tokens '

                        'remain valid' % user\_id)

rather than

            LOG.warning('User %s status has changed, but existing tokens '

This also affects Essex. Adding Thomas and the canonical security team to the bug so that they can synchronize on an Essex patch. Note that the code is very similar in Essex, so a similar patch should work.

Here is a lightly tested patch against Ubuntu's Essex based on Folsom's patch. There were no code changes, just changes to make it apply cleanly. It passes the keystone testsuite (including the newly added tests).

Hi Jamie,

Thanks a lot for sharing your patch. Indeed, I will need to maintain Essex for as long as you guys will, so I will also work on security patches each time we will have an issue. Working with you will be very nice indeed, I probably can also produce some patch backports in the future.

FYI, your patch applies also on the Debian package.

Subject: [OSSA 2013-011] Keystone tokens not immediately invalidated when
 user is deleted (CVE-2013-2059)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-011
CVE: CVE-2013-2059
Date: May 9, 2013
Title: Keystone tokens not immediately invalidated when user is deleted
Reporter: Sam Stoelinga
Products: Keystone
Affects: All versions

Description:
Sam Stoelinga reported a vulnerability in Keystone. When users are
deleted through Keystone v2 API, existing tokens for those users are not
immediately invalidated and remain valid for the duration of the token's
life (by default, up to 24 hours). This may result in users retaining
access when the administrator of the system thought them disabled. You
can workaround this issue by disabling a user before deleting it: in
that case the tokens belonging to the disabled user are immediately
invalidated. Keystone setups using the v3 API call to delete users are
unaffected.
