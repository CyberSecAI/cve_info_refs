Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unsafe read when parsing the Session Description Protocol (SDP) header's `sprop-parameter-sets` attribute in the H.264 format attribute resource within Asterisk. Specifically, the `sscanf` function was used to read the values into fixed-size buffers without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack buffer overflow:** The `sscanf` function copies the content of `sprop-parameter-sets` into fixed-size stack buffers (`sps` and `pps`) without any length limitation. If the `sprop-parameter-sets` string in the SDP message exceeds the buffer size, a stack buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful buffer overflow could allow an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Remote unauthenticated access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a malformed SDP message to the Asterisk server, meaning a remote attacker does not need authentication to trigger the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious SDP message:** The primary attack vector is sending a specially crafted SIP message with a manipulated `sprop-parameter-sets` attribute in the SDP. This malformed attribute contains a long string, exceeding the size of the stack buffers, causing the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Asterisk server.
- **Ability to send SIP messages:** The attacker must be able to send SIP messages to the server, typically over a network.
- **Knowledge of SDP format:** The attacker needs to know the SDP format to craft a malicious `sprop-parameter-sets` attribute.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was identified in Asterisk version 11.1.2, and fixed in version 11.2.2.
- The affected code is in `res/res_format_attr_h264.c`.
- Patches are available via SVN.
- The `sprop-parameter-sets` parameter is received as a string with arbitrary length from the SDP.
