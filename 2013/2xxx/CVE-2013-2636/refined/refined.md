{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The bridging code in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory structures before sending them over netlink interfaces, leading to information leaks from the kernel heap and stack.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Information Leak",
    "Insufficient initialization of data structures",
    "Exposure of sensitive memory"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged user could potentially read sensitive data from kernel memory (heap and stack), such as cryptographic keys, passwords, or other confidential information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the RTM_GETMDB netlink interface and via notify messages sent to the RTNLGRP_MDB group after successful add/del operations. An attacker can send specific netlink requests to trigger the exposure of uninitialized memory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to use the netlink interface. No special privileges are required. The attacker must be able to craft and send the necessary netlink messages."
