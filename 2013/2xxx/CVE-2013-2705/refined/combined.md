# WordPress Shopping Cart Change Log

version 4.3.6

– There is now a basic shortcode inserter for this plugin in the wp post/page editor.

– The cart orders search functionality can now search records using customerâ€™s email and name.

– Added CSS classes to the variation drop-downs.

– CSS optimization in the settings interface of the plugin.

version 4.3.5

– The deprecated page styles field has been replaced with an image URL field in the settings.

– The Image URL field can be used to specify an image/logo URL that will be displayed in the paypal checkout page.

version 4.3.4

– All the paypal supported currency codes are shown as a dropdown option in the plugin settings.

– Currency code value in the settings is automatically converted to uppercase string if the user mistakenly enters a lowercase string.

version 4.2.7

– Added a new filter for the cart icon image (wspsc\_cart\_icon\_image\_src). It can be used to customize the cart icon image.

– Added escaping for the cart link parameter.

version 4.2.6

– Added a new email merge tag for phone number (when available). The new email tag is {phone}. Note that the phone number is an optional field on PayPal checkout page. So it may not be present if the customer doesn’t enter a phone number during the checkout.

– Added a new shortcode parameter (thumb\_alt) for the product box shortcode. It can be used to specify an alt tag for the product thumbnail image.

– Added url\_decode in the cart link parameter. So the link works even when the URL contains foreign characters.

version 4.2.5

version 4.2.4
