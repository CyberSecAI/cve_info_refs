{
  "CVE-2013-2128": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel, which supports the splice(2) call for moving data across file/socket descriptors via pipe buffers, is vulnerable to a kernel crash. This occurs when splice(2) is called on a TCP socket which, in turn, calls tcp_read_sock(). A user/program could exploit this flaw to cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of socket buffers (skb) within the tcp_read_sock() function. Specifically, the copied_seq variable is not always updated correctly when skbs are consumed. This inconsistency leads to a panic in tcp_collapse(), which is triggered when the recv_actor drops the socket lock.",
    "impact": "A successful exploit results in a kernel crash, causing a system-wide denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "A local user/program can trigger the vulnerability by using the splice(2) system call on a TCP socket.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to execute programs on the affected system and invoke the splice(2) system call on a TCP socket."
