Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-2144:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks on the target storage domain when cloning a virtual machine from a snapshot in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing permission checks before cloning a VM from a snapshot to a target storage domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could exploit this flaw to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
- The attacker could exhaust the available disk space on the target storage domain by cloning a VM without proper permission checks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack exploiting the lack of permission checks in the virtualization manager's API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would require access to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager and the ability to initiate VM cloning operations from snapshots, but does not need permissions to the target domain.
