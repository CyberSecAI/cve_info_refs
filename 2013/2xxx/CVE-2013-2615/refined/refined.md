Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `fastreader` Ruby gem's improper handling of URLs, specifically in the `entry_controller.rb` file. The gem uses a system command to open URLs in a web browser. It utilizes the `open` command (or an alternative defined by the `FASTREADER_WEB` environment variable) to open the provided URL. However, it only strips whitespace from the beginning and end of the URL, not sanitizing it against shell injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The core issue is a code injection vulnerability. The gem passes the URL to a shell without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the URL, which will then be executed by the system.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `.strip` method only removes leading/trailing whitespace but does not protect against shell command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious URL with injected commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system running the `fastreader` gem, with the privileges of the user running the application. For example, a URL like `<http://www.g;id;.com>` would cause the `id` command to be executed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted URL to the `fastreader` application.
- **Application Input:** The vulnerable part of the application receives the URL as input, likely during normal operation where URLs are processed for viewing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to feed the crafted URL to the `fastreader` application. This could be done via a webpage, API, or any other mechanism the application uses to accept URLs.
- No special privileges are needed beyond being able to send a URL to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability exists in this code snippet from `entry_controller.rb`:
```ruby
115       # open web browser
116       command = (ENV['FASTREADER_WEB'] || "open") + " {@current_entry.url.strip}"
117       `{command}`
```
- Line 116 constructs a command string by concatenating the browser command (`open` or the `FASTREADER_WEB` value) with the URL retrieved from `@current_entry.url`. The `.strip` method on the URL only removes leading and trailing whitespace.
- Line 117 executes the constructed command using backticks ``, which pass it to the shell. This makes shell injection possible.

**Summary of relevant information:**
- Vulnerability: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via code injection
- Affected Software: Ruby gem `fastreader` version 1.0.8
- Exploitable Input: URLs provided to the application
- Vulnerable Code: The vulnerable code constructs a command string with an unsanitized URL and executes it using backticks.
