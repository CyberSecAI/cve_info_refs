How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Download Apache OFBiz

 ![image fullwidth](images/Download.jpg)

 **Use the links below to download Apache OFBiz releases from the "Apache Download Mirrors" page. The download page also includes instructions on how to verify the integrity of the release file using the signature and hash (PGP, SHA512) available for each release. If you need more information about why and how to verify the integrity of the release file [this → page is what you look for](http://www.apache.org/info/verification.html)**

 **Then, to install OFBiz, follow the explanations in the "INSTALL" file found in the just downloaded/extracted OFBiz main directory.**

**PLEASE NOTE:** Despite our best efforts to maintain up to three active release branches, support for older branches can decrease because our project volunteers may be focused on other issues. We recommend using releases from the most recent branch wherever possible.

**NOTE: To minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities the Apache OFBiz community highly recommends that all users upgrade to the latest stable release.**

The history of security related fixes included in each release is
available [here](security.html)

## Apache OFBiz 18.12.17

Released in November 2024, this is the 17th release of the 18.12 series, that has been stabilized since December 2018.

[Download OFBiz 18.12.17](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/ofbiz/apache-ofbiz-18.12.17.zip)
[[PGP]](https://downloads.apache.org/ofbiz/apache-ofbiz-18.12.17.zip.asc)

[[KEYS]](https://downloads.apache.org/ofbiz/KEYS)
[[Release Notes]](release-notes-18.12.17.html)

**We strongly encourage OfBiz users to report security problems affecting OFBiz to the private security mailing lists (either security@ofbiz.apache.org or security@apache.org),
before disclosing them in a public forum. Please don't pack several vulnerabilities in the same report, send them one by one, thanks in advance.**

Note that we no longer create CVEs for post-auth attacks done using demo credentials, notably using the admin user.
 **[Rather create bugs reports in our issue tracker (Jira) for that.](https://s.apache.org/dsj2p) Please don't create Jira issues for unauth (aka pre-auth) reports, thanks in advance.**

One of the reason we no longer create CVEs for post-auth attacks done using demo credentials is because
 [we highly suggest to OFBiz users to not use credentials demo in production](https://nightlies.apache.org/ofbiz/trunk/readme/html5/#security)
and we expect OFBiz users to do so.
 [We also warn our users on the "Keeping OFBiz secure wiki page".](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Keeping%2BOFBiz%2Bsecure)
And finally, mostly we reject post-auth vulnerabilities because we have a solid CSRF defense.
