Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Chromium browser handles the trust level of renderer processes during sign-in and subsequent sync operations. Specifically, the browser did not properly verify if a renderer process should be considered "trusted" for these operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Trust Validation:** The core weakness is the inadequate validation of a renderer process's trust status. This allowed for a potentially malicious or compromised renderer process to be treated as if it was legitimate.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By bypassing trust checks, an attacker could potentially gain access to a user's sign-in information and their synced data.
*   **Confusion during sign-in and sync:** The description highlights confusion around setting up sign-in and sync. This suggests the vulnerability may allow malicious renderers to interfere with and manipulate the sign-in or sync process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A successful exploit would allow an attacker to bypass authentication, potentially gaining access to a user's account, including synced data like browser history, bookmarks, passwords and settings. This could lead to serious privacy breaches and potential identity theft.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Renderer Process:**  The attack vector involves a malicious or compromised renderer process on the user's machine. This process could be achieved through various means like a malicious website or extension.
*   **Malicious web content/extension:** An attacker could potentially introduce malicious code within a website or browser extension that runs in a compromised renderer process, enabling the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to compromise or control a renderer process:** An attacker needs to be able to execute code within a renderer process, or have a compromised renderer process.
*   **Knowledge of sign-in and sync mechanisms:** The attacker would need some understanding of the authentication and sync mechanisms used by Chromium to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The exploit may require a user to interact with a compromised webpage or extension for the vulnerability to be triggered. However the interaction might be minor and unnoticed by the victim.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This CVE is part of a larger group of vulnerabilities patched in the Chrome 28 update.
*   The severity is rated as High.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Andrey Labunets who was rewarded $21,500 for the combination of CVE-2013-2879 and CVE-2013-2868 as well as some server side bugs.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in chromium-browser version 28.0.1500.71
