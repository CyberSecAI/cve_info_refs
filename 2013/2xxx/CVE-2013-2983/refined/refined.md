- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could execute a script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting web site, once the URL is clicked. This could be used to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when clicked by a victim, executes arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious URL that a victim will click.
