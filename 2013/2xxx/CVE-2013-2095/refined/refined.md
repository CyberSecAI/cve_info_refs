Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-2095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `URI.parse()` in the `cartridge_cache.rb` file within the rubygem-openshift-origin-controller. Specifically, `URI.parse()` allows semicolons (`;`) and dollar signs (`$`) within the URL, which are not properly sanitized.
- This flaw allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands when the parsed URL is later used in a `curl` command executed via backticks `` ` ``.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, arising from the improper handling of special characters by `URI.parse()` and the subsequent use of the unsanitized URL in a backtick command execution.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system fails to sanitize the URL input, allowing for malicious characters like `;` and `$` to pass through without being neutralized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server running the OpenShift broker. This can lead to a wide range of impacts including:
    - **System Compromise:** Attackers can potentially gain full control of the server.
    - **Data Breach:**  Attackers can steal sensitive information.
    - **Denial of Service:** Attackers can disrupt the services provided by the server.
    - **System Instability:** As seen in the example, a simple `reboot` command is possible.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify data or perform other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote exploitation via API calls:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted API requests to the OpenShift broker's REST API.
- **Cartridge URL Manipulation:** The specific attack vector involves manipulating the `url` parameter of a cartridge definition during application creation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker requires valid credentials to access the OpenShift broker's API. The example provided shows the usage of the `-u jechoi:pw` parameter to authenticate the request with username `jechoi` and password `pw`
- **API Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send POST requests to the applications endpoint of the OpenShift broker's REST API.
- **Understanding of API:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of the structure of the API and the parameters it accepts.
