| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c0)  Vladimir Anufriev   2013-09-10 16:45:36 UTC  ``` User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/23.0  RPM package srtp-devel has missed file /usr/include/srtp/config.h, which is included in /usr/include/srtp/integers.h line 50  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Try to compile a C program with /usr/include/srtp/integers.h included Actual Results:   Can't open "config.h"  Expected Results:   Compiled successfully  This is required for building Asterisk PBX. You need to add srtp/crypto/include/config.h in spec file for rpmbuild ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c1)  Stanislav Brabec   2013-09-18 15:10:56 UTC  ``` They attempt to include autoconf style config.h. It is bad, as it is not intended to be a public include (it causes symbol conflicts).  There is a new development of srtp in Cisco repositories: <https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp>  It contains security fix ([bug 828009](show_bug.cgi?id=828009 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2013-2139: srtp: libsrtp buffer overflow flaw")). I'll check whether it fixes also this bug and whether it makes sense to switch for openSUSE 13.1. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c2)  Stanislav Brabec   2013-09-18 18:40:28 UTC  ``` New upstream does not address this issue.  Debian does not address this issue.  Fedora addresses this issue, but in a bit hacky way - rename config.h to config-32/64.h and create a new dedicated file.  This does not change anything on the fact, that include file named config.h (even worse, "config.h" with quotes, i. e. prefer build-time local file) is a bad idea. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c3)  Stanislav Brabec   2013-09-18 20:11:51 UTC  ``` I have upgraded to Cisco repository (which is not a branch but a regular development migration from CVS to GIT)  Then I have created a fix, that installs config.h and rewrites all potentially colliding symbols and include file references to a safe form.  Project: [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:sbrabec:branches:network:telephony/libsrtp](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home%3Asbrabec%3Abranches%3Anetwork%3Atelephony/libsrtp)  Packages: [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/sbrabec:/branches:/network:/telephony/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home%3A/sbrabec%3A/branches%3A/network%3A/telephony/)  Could you test whether you can compile asterisk with it? (Or send me a link to Build Service project.) ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c4)  Stanislav Brabec   2013-09-19 14:19:29 UTC  ``` Vladimir Anufriev wrote:  configure:27417: checking for srtp_init in -lsrtp  configure:27442: gcc -o conftest -g -O2    conftest.c -lsrtp   -lm  >&5  /usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.7/../../../../lib64/libsrtp.so: undefined reference to `ekt_alloc'  /usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.7/../../../../lib64/libsrtp.so: undefined reference to `ekt_octets_after_base_tag'  /usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.7/../../../../lib64/libsrtp.so: undefined reference to `ekt_stream_init_from_policy'  /usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.7/../../../../lib64/libsrtp.so: undefined reference to `ekt_write_data'  /usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.7/../../../../lib64/libsrtp.so: undefined reference to `srtp_stream_init_from_ekt'  collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status   It is my fault. The libsrtp-automake.patch needs deeper changes to incorporate the new source files. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c5)  Stanislav Brabec   2013-09-26 17:48:45 UTC  ``` I just finished fixing of headers to be able to compile asterisk-1.8.23.1.  Not only that srtp/config.h was incorrect, but also /usr/share/openh323/openh323u.mak from openh323-devel-1.19.0.1 was broken, and pointed to the build directories instead of install directories.  Now I can compile asterisk configured by ./configure --with-srtp without any change.  Please test, whether it compiles and works in a real world use. Thanks.  Note: You may need to install also openh323-debugsource. Asterisk refers to source files, and is is the easiest way to provide source files. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c6)  Stanislav Brabec   2013-10-03 16:48:07 UTC  ``` From the e-mail:  Now it is compiled ok. Functionality I'll check later because of it needs more work.  I think that your packages may be included in factory line of OpenSuse and updates for 12.3. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c7)  Stanislav Brabec   2013-10-03 17:53:55 UTC  ``` Created maintenance requests: obs maintenance request id 202073 for openh323 (12.2, 12.3) obs maintenance request id 202074 for srtp (12.3; just the header fix and nothing else)  Submitted to network:telephony and waiting for review and re-sending to Factory: openh323: obs request id 202064 libsrtp:  obs request id 202067 (upgrade, fix and all above mentioned changes) srtp: osc drop request id 202068 (rename is not implemented in OBS, drop and create new project with a different name) ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c8)  Marcus Meissner   2013-10-08 09:05:46 UTC  ``` this debugsource dependency is very ugly.  what files does it need from there, and why are they not in -devel? ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c9)  Stanislav Brabec   2013-10-08 12:59:25 UTC  ``` Yes, it is ugly. That is why I added it only as a Suggests, the weakest dependency possible.  The problem is in the /usr/share/openh323/openh323u.mak, which contains variable OH323_SRCDIR. And OH323_SRCDIR is used in the LIBRARY_MAKEFILE rule below.  If the OH323_SRCDIR is set to non-existing directory, then for example compilation of asterisk fails.  openh323-debuginfo provides files that make asterisk build process happy.  Maybe it could be solved by a detailed analysis of the exact purpose of the OH323_SRCDIR and then rewriting of openh323u.mak and/or providing needed source files in the devel package. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c10)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2013-10-11 08:00:14 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (839475) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/202932> Factory / openh323 ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=839475#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2013-10-28 12:04:25 UTC  ``` openSUSE-RU-2013:1581-1: An update that has one recommended fix can now be installed.

# [GTA-2013-01] - Libsrtp srtp\_protect/hmac\_compute buffer overflow

---

Hash: SHA1

*Title*

Libsrtp srtp_protect/hmac_compute buffer overflow

*Affected products*

- - libsrtp (<https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp>) all versions

*Description*

Libsrtp is the Cisco Systems, Inc. reference implementation of the
Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP), RTP is the Real-time
Transport Protocol, an IETF standard for the transport of real-time
data such as telephony, audio, and video, defined by RFC 3550. Secure
RTP (SRTP) is an RTP profile for providing confidentiality to RTP data
and authentication to the RTP header and payload. SRTP is an IETF
Proposed Standard, defined in RFC 3711, and was developed in the IETF
Audio/Video Transport (AVT) Working Group.

There is a buffer overflow in libsrtp based on how the function
crypto_policy_set_from_profile_for_rtp applies the cryptographic
profiles srtp_profile_aes128_cm_sha1_32/srtp_profile_aes256_cm_sha1_32
to a srtp_policy, as shown by the source code of srtp/srtp.c (line
2059, #b705554)

err_status_t
crypto_policy_set_from_profile_for_rtp(
    crypto_policy_t *policy,
    srtp_profile_t profile) {
...
case srtp_profile_aes128_cm_sha1_32:
   crypto_policy_set_aes_cm_128_hmac_sha1_32(policy);
   crypto_policy_set_aes_cm_128_hmac_sha1_80(policy);
break;
...
case srtp_profile_aes256_cm_sha1_32:
crypto_policy_set_aes_cm_256_hmac_sha1_32(policy);
crypto_policy_set_aes_cm_256_hmac_sha1_80(policy);
break;
...

The above code shows that the functions crypto_policy_set_* are called
in more than one opportunity with different policies, setting the
member auth_tag_len of the crypto_policy_t struct to 10 bytes instead
of 4 bytes which is expected.

Later, when an auth_type_t for our selected crypto policy is
allocated, it will has a wrong value in the member out_len.

The buffer overflow arise when the function srtp_protect() tries to
add the authentication tag to the packet using the macro
auth_compute(), which expands to a hmac_compute() function using the
out_len member mentioned previously as length for a write operation,
writing 6 bytes more than expected to the buffer pointed by the
rtp_hdr argument, triggering a buffer overflow.

*Security Patches*

- - Cisco has fixed this issue in the public repository of the libsrtp.

*Credits*

This security issue was discovered and researched by Fernando Russ
(fruss), Security Researcher of Groundworks Technologies
(<http://www.groundworkstech.com>)

*Time line*

05-23-2013 - Groundworks Technologies contacts Cisco's PSIRT about a
potential vulnerability in libsrtp.

05-23-2013 - PSIRT acknowledge the reception of the report and assigns
the PSIRT-0717634467 track number to the issue.

05-24-2013 - PSIRT informs that they had started researching the
issue, keeping Groundworks Technologies posted about this.

05-28-2012 - A Issue called "Potential buffer overflow in
srtp_protect()" is publicly opened with id #24 in libsrtp's github
repo without any credits to Groundworks Technologies.
(<https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp/issues/24>)

05-28-2012 - A patch to the libsrtp's documentation hinting this issue
was committed with id #5e33729
(<https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp/commit-5e33729c149aa698433c3>
f9375c6e8bb21cc3e56)

05-30-2013 - PSIRT informs that this issue is a "documentation" issue,
and they will fit it according. PSIRT justifies this saying,
[...]"A conservative design would ensure that there was enough room
at the end of the packet for a 10-byte authentication tag, which
is the length recommended by the standard.
If the implementations did this, then the bug in the "set from
profile" function wouldn't cause any issues."[...]

05-03-2012 - Groundworks Technologies responds to Cisco's PSIRT saying,
[...]"From my point of view, allocating more space in a
buffer to avoid a buffer overflow triggered because we setup the
library to write a 32bits tag at the end of a buffer and it writes
80bits because its applies the wrong crypto policy...
has nothing to do with "conservative design" or "documentation".
It's a bug with security implications."[...]
Groundworks asks about if there is any intention of publishing a PSIRT
security notice regarding this issue and tell about the uncredited
ticket #24 which appears before the last notification. Also,
Groundworks Technologies informs that it will make this issue public.

05-30-2013 - PSIRT answers saying that they have no intention on
publishing any security notice regarding this issue, because Cisco
don't use this library in any of its products. Also said, that the
library is maintained by purely voluntarism of its maintainers.
Also, they said that they will fix the credits for the Issue #24
a soon as possible.

05-30-2013 - The credits information for the Issue #24 was added.

Package        : srtp
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2139
Debian Bug     : 711163

  Fernando Russ from Groundworks Technologies reported a buffer overflow
  flaw in srtp, Cisco's reference implementation of the Secure Real-time
  Transport Protocol (SRTP), in how the
  crypto_policy_set_from_profile_for_rtp() function applies
  cryptographic profiles to an srtp_policy. A remote attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability to crash an application linked against
  libsrtp, resulting in a denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4~dfsg-6+deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4+20100615~dfsg-2+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~20130609~dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~20130609~dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your srtp packages.

Package        : srtp
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2139
Debian Bug     : 711163

  Fernando Russ from Groundworks Technologies reported a buffer overflow
  flaw in srtp, Cisco's reference implementation of the Secure Real-time
  Transport Protocol (SRTP), in how the
  crypto_policy_set_from_profile_for_rtp() function applies
  cryptographic profiles to an srtp_policy. A remote attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability to crash an application linked against
  libsrtp, resulting in a denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4~dfsg-6+deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4+20100615~dfsg-2+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~20130609~dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~20130609~dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your srtp packages.

## Updated srtp package fixes security vulnerability

Publication date: 21 Nov 2014

Modification date: 21 Nov 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2013-2139](CVE-2013-2139.html)

## Description

```
Fernando Russ from Groundworks Technologies reported a buffer overflow flaw
in srtp, Cisco's reference implementation of the Secure Real-time Transport
Protocol (SRTP), in how the crypto_policy_set_from_profile_for_rtp() function
applies cryptographic profiles to an srtp_policy. A remote attacker could
exploit this vulnerability to crash an application linked against libsrtp,
resulting in a denial of service (CVE-2013-2139).
