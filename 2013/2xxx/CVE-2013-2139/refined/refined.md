Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2139:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `libsrtp` library, specifically within the `crypto_policy_set_from_profile_for_rtp` function. This function incorrectly applies cryptographic profiles, leading to an inconsistency in the expected and actual authentication tag lengths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Crypto Profile Application:** The `crypto_policy_set_from_profile_for_rtp` function, when handling `srtp_profile_aes128_cm_sha1_32` and `srtp_profile_aes256_cm_sha1_32` profiles, calls `crypto_policy_set_*` functions multiple times with different policies. This results in the `auth_tag_len` member of the `crypto_policy_t` struct being set to 10 bytes instead of the expected 4 bytes.
- **Mismatched Authentication Tag Length:** This incorrect `auth_tag_len` leads to an incorrect `out_len` value in the allocated `auth_type_t` struct.
- **Buffer Overflow in `srtp_protect()`:** When `srtp_protect()` attempts to add the authentication tag to the packet using the `auth_compute()` macro (which expands to `hmac_compute()`), it uses the incorrect `out_len`, causing it to write 6 bytes more than expected to the buffer pointed to by the `rtp_hdr` argument, resulting in a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can cause a crash in applications linked against `libsrtp`, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in all sources, one source mentions the possibility of code execution as a potential impact, in addition to the crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, affecting applications that utilize `libsrtp` for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data that would trigger the vulnerable code path in `libsrtp`. This would require the ability to establish an SRTP communication with a target application using a vulnerable version of the library and trigger the use of the vulnerable crypto profiles.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and researched by Fernando Russ from Groundworks Technologies.
*   Cisco, the maintainer of `libsrtp`, addressed the issue in their public repository with a patch that removes the double invocations of crypto policy setting functions, and ensures correct profile usage.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in various distributions, including openSUSE, Debian, Fedora and Mageia, which released security updates.
*   Some reports note that the impact was considered "moderate" or "low" severity by various vendors due to the complexity of exploitation or the limited scope of applications potentially exposed.
