Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2088:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `svn-keyword-check.pl` pre-commit hook script included in Subversion distributions up to version 1.6.22. This script, intended to check for keyword substitutions in files, improperly handles filenames passed to shell commands via the `system()` function. Specifically, it does not sanitize or escape filenames obtained from `svnlook changed` output before using them in further `svnlook` commands and `system()` calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Because filenames are not properly escaped when passed to `svnlook` and the shell via `system()`, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting filenames containing malicious code. This is due to the script using `system()` calls with unsanitized user-controlled input.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The script fails to sanitize filenames before using them in shell commands, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running the Subversion server (typically the web server user, e.g., `www-data`).
*   **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the server configuration and permissions of the user the webserver runs as, an attacker could potentially gain full control of the server. This could include deleting the repository, stealing data, or establishing persistent access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Filenames:** The primary attack vector involves creating or modifying files within the Subversion repository with carefully crafted filenames containing shell commands. For example, an attacker could create a file named "`file; id > /tmp/output;`" that, when processed by the vulnerable script, would execute the `id` command and write its output to `/tmp/output`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated Subversion user with commit privileges to the repository where the vulnerable `svn-keyword-check.pl` pre-commit hook is active. Anonymous users cannot typically exploit this because they lack commit access.
*   **Vulnerable Server:** The Subversion server must be running a vulnerable version of Subversion (<= 1.6.22), and the `svn-keyword-check.pl` script must be in use as the pre-commit hook with the vulnerable code.
*   **Pre-commit Hook Configuration:** The pre-commit hook should be set up to call `svn-keyword-check.pl` and the hook script should have the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The exploit requires the user to manually fix an error in the perl script `svn-keyword-check.pl` to allow for any commits.
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to create files with malicious names and commit them to trigger the vulnerability, resulting in arbitrary command execution on the server.
*   The exploit can be modified to prevent output from being sent back to the client if the executed command does not terminate immediately (for reverse shells etc)
*   The exploit replaces `/` characters with `$(pwd)` to handle the limitation of filenames not being able to contain `/`
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Subversion versions 1.6.23, 1.7.11, and 1.8.0 and later.
