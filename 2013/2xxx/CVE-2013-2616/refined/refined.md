Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2616:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `MiniMagic` ruby gem, a wrapper for ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick command-line tools, is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The gem directly incorporates user-provided URLs into a shell command without proper sanitization. Specifically, the code uses string interpolation to build the command, and the `.strip` method is insufficient to remove malicious characters like `;`.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not properly sanitize the input URLs before using them in shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into a URL, which will then be executed on the server running the vulnerable application. This could lead to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URLs:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing shell commands and provides this URL to the application using the `MiniMagic` gem. For instance, a URL might contain a `;` followed by a shell command like `rm -rf /`
*   **Example Code:** The vulnerable code snippet provided is:
    ```ruby
    image = MiniMagick::Image.open(remoteurl)
    image.resize "5x5"
    image.format "gif"
    image.write "localcopy.gif"
    ```
    The `remoteurl` variable is where the attacker would inject the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide URLs:** The attacker must be able to supply a URL to an application utilizing the `MiniMagic` gem in a vulnerable manner.
*   **No authentication bypass needed:** The vulnerability does not rely on any authentication bypass.
*   **No prior access to the server:** The attacker does not require prior access to the server.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `mini_magick` before a fix was implemented.
*   The vulnerability was tested on Ruby 1.9.2 and Ruby 1.8.7
*   The vulnerability exists due to how the gem constructs shell commands using user-provided input.
