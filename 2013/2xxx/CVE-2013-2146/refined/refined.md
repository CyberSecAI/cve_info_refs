{
  "CVE-2013-2146": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Performance Events implementation. On systems with certain Intel processors, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by leveraging the perf subsystem to write into the reserved bits of the OFFCORE_RSP_0 and OFFCORE_RSP_1 model-specific registers.",
    "Root cause": "The valid mask for the offcore response registers (MSR_OFFCORE_RSP_0 and MSR_OFFCORE_RSP_1) was incorrect for certain Intel processors (SNB/SNB-EP, IVB/IVB-EP). This allowed writing to reserved bits.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect access control",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local unprivileged user can cause a denial of service by crashing the kernel.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local unprivileged user can leverage the perf subsystem to write to the Model Specific Registers (MSRs) OFFCORE_RSP_0 and OFFCORE_RSP_1, writing into the reserved bits and causing a General Protection fault, which crashes the kernel.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local unprivileged user access to the system with the Performance Events Subsystem enabled (CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS=y)."
