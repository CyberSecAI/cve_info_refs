Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2498:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from unsanitized input being passed to a SQL query in the login page of the Simple HRM system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The system is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to a lack of sanitization of the `username` parameter in the login form. The vulnerable code is located in `simlehrm/flexycms/modules/user/user_manager.php` on line 84.
- Specifically, the code directly incorporates the user-provided `$name` variable into a SQL query string without proper escaping or parameterization:
  ```php
  $res_company = getsingleindexrow('CALL get_search_sql("'.TABLE_PREFIX.'company","email_id = \''.$name.'\' AND isactive = 1 LIMIT 1")');
  ```

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code through the login form using a specially crafted `username` parameter, potentially allowing them to:
  - Obtain sensitive information, such as password hashes, from the database.
  - Potentially modify data within the database.
  - Gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed via an HTTP POST request to the login endpoint.
- **Vulnerable parameter:** The `username` parameter in the login form is used to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Attack URL:** `http://localhost/simplehrm/index.php/user/setLogin` (example URL from the content)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable login page.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
