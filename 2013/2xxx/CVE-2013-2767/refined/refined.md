Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is present in Citrix NetScaler and Access Gateway Enterprise Edition due to a configuration issue when deployed in a specific double-hop configuration. This allows a remote attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to internal network resources.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper access control leading to unauthorized network resource access. The issue is specifically triggered in a double-hop configuration when the NetScaler appliance firmware versions up to and including 10.0.74.4 are used.

Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to internal network resources, potentially leading to data breaches, further system compromise, or service disruption.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is remote, with the attacker exploiting a flaw in the access controls to bypass security measures. The vulnerability is only exploitable when the NetScaler appliance is set up in a double-hop configuration.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be remote and has the ability to interact with the vulnerable Citrix NetScaler/Access Gateway. No special privileges are required; the attacker needs network access to the affected device.
