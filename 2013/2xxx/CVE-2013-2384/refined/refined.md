## CVE-2013-2384

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from errors within the font layout and glyph table processing in the 2D component of Java/JDK, which uses the ICU (International Components for Unicode) Layout Engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Font Layout and Glyph Table Processing Errors:** The 2D component has multiple errors when handling font layout and font glyph tables. These errors lead to incorrect or insufficient validation of data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Bypass:** An untrusted Java application or applet could exploit these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Malicious input could cause memory corruption in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** There is a possibility of arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable Java process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Untrusted Java Application/Applet:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing untrusted fonts in a Java application or applet.
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely since the untrusted applet or application can be delivered across a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Deploy/Influence Java Applications:** The attacker needs to be able to deploy a malicious java application/applet, or influence the input of a vulnerable application using malformed fonts. 

**Technical Details:**

*   The root cause lies within the ICU Layout Engine code embedded in Java/JDK.
*   The vulnerability is related to how the Java 2D component handles font layout and glyph table processing.
*   The fixes are part of a combined patch that addresses multiple CVEs.
*   The affected code is related to font loading and rendering code.
*  The specific issues are tied to font tables such as 'morx' tables.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information emphasizes that it is difficult to match each specific error to its respective CVE identifier due to the combined patching approach.
*   Multiple Red Hat advisories and OpenSUSE updates were released to address this vulnerability, indicating it impacted multiple products.
*   The vulnerability affects OpenJDK, Oracle JDK, IBM JDK and HP-UX systems using the impacted versions of Java.
*  The fix for this vulnerability is often delivered as part of a larger set of security patches, such as those released in the Oracle April 2013 CPU.
* Patches involved modifying the source code in the `src/share/native/sun/font/layout` directory, specifically files handling glyph substitution, layout engines, and state tables.

This vulnerability is rated as **urgent** or **critical** by various sources.
