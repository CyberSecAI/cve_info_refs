  "CVE-2013-2172": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an XML signature via a specially-crafted XML signature block.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper validation of the CanonicalizationMethod parameter in XML signatures. Apache Santuario allowed specifying arbitrary canonicalization algorithms, which could be abused to manipulate the SignedInfo XML fragment.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper validation of input parameters",
          "Use of non-standard canonicalization algorithms"

       "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an XML signature.",
        "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is exploitable via crafted XML signatures.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker with the ability to provide crafted XML signatures can exploit the vulnerability."
