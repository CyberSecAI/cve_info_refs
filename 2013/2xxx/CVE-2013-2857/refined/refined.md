Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2857:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the image handling component of Chromium.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Use-after-free:** A memory location is accessed after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior. This occurs in the image handling part of the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker could crash the browser due to the memory corruption caused by the use-after-free.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** There is also a possibility for other unspecified impacts. This means it's possible, though not certain, that this vulnerability could be used for more severe consequences than just crashing the browser, such as arbitrary code execution, though this is not detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attackers:** The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers.
*   **Image Handling:** The attack vector is related to how Chromium handles images. The exact mechanism isn't specified, but it is triggered via some kind of malformed image processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to cause the affected Chromium browser to handle a specially crafted image to trigger the use-after-free. This could be done via a malicious webpage, for example.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Chromium version 27.0.1453.110.
*   The vulnerability was credited to miaubiz.
*   A reward of $1000 was given for the report of this vulnerability.
