Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-2131:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a format string bug in the `rrdtool` Python module, specifically within the `rrdtool.graph` function. This function uses `printf`-style formatting, which, when not properly sanitized, can lead to exploitation.
- The underlying cause is that the `rrdtool` library itself does not perform format string checks, and neither did the Python binding initially.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability (CWE-134):** The core issue is the use of user-controlled input within a format string, which allows attackers to inject format specifiers (e.g., `%n`, `%x`, etc.).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation leads to a crash of the `rrdtool` process, resulting in a denial of service. As noted in the RedHat Bugzilla entry, both the python module and the rrdtool binary itself are vulnerable:
    -   "Also, the rrdtool python module crashes on format string exploit ... Segmentation fault"
    -  "$ rrdtool graph /tmp/out.png -f '%n%n' *** %n in writable segment detected *** Aborted (core dumped)"

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `rrdtool.graph` function, where a malicious format string is passed to the `-f` option.
- In the context of Zenoss, where `rrdtool` is used for graphing, an attacker could potentially inject the malicious format string through arguments passed to the graphing function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to pass arguments to the `rrdtool.graph` function or to influence the format string used in the function.
- In a scenario like Zenoss, where `rrdtool` is used, a user who can control the arguments passed to `rrdtool.graph` (directly or indirectly) could trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

- **Affected Versions:** The advisory and bug reports state that the `rrdtool` module 1.4.7 is affected, though specific vulnerable versions were not provided.
- **Patch:** The vulnerability was addressed in upstream with a check to sanitize the format string input, specifically in the `imginfo` function. This was done by commit `37d3050caed517538efa1f6fc28fda48aee3d53e` in `rrdtool-1.x`.
- **Upstream Fix:** The fix was merged upstream in commit `5841e30835c984b6509ccaa35ca9a50d4009b9b2`.
- **Red Hat's Stance:** Red Hat initially considered this a feature of the tool rather than a security flaw because the rrdtool documentation states it allows `printf` style arguments to `rrdtool graph`.  However, they eventually acknowledged the issue after the upstream fix.
- **Zenoss Context:** The vulnerability was reported as impacting Zenoss because Zenoss users could influence `rrdtool` arguments. This highlights how a seemingly minor flaw in a library can impact larger applications.

In summary, CVE-2013-2131 is a format string vulnerability in `rrdtool`, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service.  The provided information from GitHub, Red Hat Bugzilla, and Openwall mailing lists offers a complete view of the issue, including its discovery, impact, and fix.
