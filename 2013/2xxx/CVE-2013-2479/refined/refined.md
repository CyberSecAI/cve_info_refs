{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The MPLS Echo dissector in Wireshark did not properly handle malformed packets, leading to an infinite loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed packets",
      "Infinite loop vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A malformed MPLS packet could cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Injecting a malformed packet onto the network",
      "Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets or provide a malformed packet trace to the victim."

  "affected_products": [
    "Wireshark versions 1.8.0 to 1.8.5"
