| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=916224#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-04 13:08:09 UTC  ``` Lubomir Rintel 2013-04-03 11:29:50 EDT Description of problem:  There are serveral problems with the way Jython creates class cache files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.  # (umask 000; jython -c 'import xmllib') # ls -l '/usr/share/jython/Lib/xmllib$py.class' -rw-rw-rw-. 1 root root 52874 Apr  3 17:24 /usr/share/jython/Lib/xmllib$py.class  Jython does not explicitly set permissions of the class files; therefore with weak umask it creates world-writable files, or discloses sensitive data that would be in a non-world-readable package file.  Also, the package writes to /usr/share, which it shouldn't; /var/cache would be more appropriate, but would still lead to a possibility of a content disclosure.  The only really portable and secure way to cache class files would be a directory in user's home with 0700 permissions.  It is currently even not possible to easily disable the caching, since the configuration file is not marked with %config and resides in /usr/share instead of /etc.  References: <http://bugs.jython.org/msg8004> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=947949> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2027> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=916224#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-02-04 14:44:25 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started. This issue was rated as low. Please submit fixed packages until 2015-03-04. When done, reassign the bug to security-team@suse.de. <https://swamp.suse.de/webswamp/wf/60538> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=916224#c3)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2015-02-04 15:00:08 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (916224) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/284056> Factory / jython <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/284057> 13.2 / jython <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/284058> 13.1 / jython ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=916224#c5)  Tomáš Chvátal   2015-02-04 16:12:35 UTC  ``` All should be done, let me know if something is wrong. Also for sle11 I had to tweak a lot the jython-cached-classes.patch compared to other products, so I think it should be right, but if someone could look at it too might be good idea :)  I hate when they change the code this lot :) ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=916224#c8)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-02-12 12:05:07 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2015:0269-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

I'm not going to do that -- the upstream is unresponsive and I no longer use the package.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=947949#c13)  Pablo Kraan    2015-05-27 13:16:00 UTC  ``` This issue appears as fixed, but there is no "Fixed In Version" info and I was not able to search a commit related to this fix. Could you tell me what is/will be the version where this fix will be include?  Thanks   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=947949#c15)  Kurt Seifried    2017-12-18 22:01:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of jython as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5 and 6. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue.

It's still outdated in Cauldron even though a new version has been available in Fedora since May 30, 2014.

If the directory structure is created with the PoC instead then dirs are 777 and file is 666  ie.

The original bug report says that it creates class files with insecure permissions if a weak umask is used, so I guess the fix is partially effective in that it respects the umask and doesn't just use 666 permissions on the class files all the time, but still doesn't address what happens with a weak umask by ensuring that the class files aren't world-writable.  I guess one could argue it should, but maybe it's debatable whether it's still a security issue now.  If you set a weak umask, maybe you deserve what you get. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=15275#c11)  claire robinson    2015-02-27 17:50:15 CET  ``` Yes, seems like a partial fix. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=15275#c12)  claire robinson    2015-02-27 17:56:28 CET  ``` Adding feedback marker for now ```  ---   Whiteboard: has\_procedure => has\_procedure feedback  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=15275#c13)  David Walser    2015-03-05 21:12:35 CET  ``` A response has been posted on the RedHat bug: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=947949#c12>  We can go ahead and OK this.
