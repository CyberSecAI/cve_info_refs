Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE). The affected products can process XML documents containing entities with URLs that resolve to external documents, causing the product to embed these documents incorrectly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The core issue is the software's failure to properly restrict the use of external entities within XML documents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to local files and internal resources by exploiting the XXE vulnerability.
*   **Arbitrary HTTP Request Execution:** The vulnerability may allow the server to execute arbitrary HTTP requests.
*   **System Availability Impact:** Exploitation could negatively impact system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the processing of maliciously crafted XML documents.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely; it requires local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker requires local access to the affected system.
*   The attacker needs a medium skill level to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to include external XML entities which could lead to disclosure of confidential information via access to local files or internal resources or cause execution of arbitrary HTTP requests. The vulnerability is present in the way the application processes XML documents with external entities.

**Additional Information:**
*   The advisory provides a CVSS v2 base score of 6.9 with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
*   Patches for affected product versions (7.10 and 7.20) have been released by Schneider Electric. Users of older versions are advised to upgrade to a newer version.
*   Mitigation strategies include network segmentation, firewall implementation, and secure remote access methods like VPNs
*   The vulnerability was reported by Timur Yunusov, Alexey Osipov, and Ilya Karpov of Positive Technologies.
