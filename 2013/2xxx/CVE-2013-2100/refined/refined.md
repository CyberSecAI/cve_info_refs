Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `urlopen()` function within Gentoo's Portage package manager not properly validating X.509 SSL certificates when using HTTPS. This means that when Portage downloads package lists or binary packages over HTTPS, it doesn't verify if the server it is communicating with is legitimate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing SSL Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of SSL certificates in the `urlopen()` function. This allows an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack by presenting a fake certificate.
*   **Insecure HTTPS Usage:** While HTTPS was used to provide a secure connection, the missing validation rendered the security measures ineffective.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker can intercept communication between Portage and the server providing package lists or binary packages.
*   **Spoofed Servers:** The attacker can present a fake server with modified package lists and malicious binary packages.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Since Portage runs with high privileges, by injecting a malicious binary package, an attacker can gain complete control over the victim's machine. This could allow them to install backdoors, steal sensitive data, or cause other severe harm.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the victim's machine and the legitimate server hosting package data.
*   **DNS Spoofing:** The attacker could also perform DNS spoofing to redirect the victim's machine to a server they control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or redirect network traffic.
*   **Fake SSL Certificate:** The attacker must have a fake SSL certificate that can be presented to the victim's system.
*   **Server Infrastructure:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious package lists and binary packages.

**Additional Details (Not in CVE Description):**

*   The vulnerability existed in the `pym/portage/util/_urlopen.py` file.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by using `FETCHCOMMAND` which relies on `wget` for fetching over HTTPS, since `wget` correctly validates SSL certificates.
*   A secondary issue was found with the `repoman` tool which was also fixed by using `FETCHCOMMAND`.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in `sys-apps/portage-2.1.12.2`.

In summary, CVE-2013-2100 describes a serious vulnerability where a lack of SSL certificate validation in Gentoo Portage's `urlopen()` function allows for man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially leading to remote code execution on the victim's system. The vulnerability was present when using HTTPS for retrieving binary package lists and packages.
