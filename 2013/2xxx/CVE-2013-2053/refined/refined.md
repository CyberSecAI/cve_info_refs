  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-2053",
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow flaw exists in Openswan's `atodn()` function, which is triggered when parsing DNS TXT records containing an FQDN with an '=' character while Opportunistic Encryption (OE) is enabled.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause the `pluto` IKE daemon to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote, via a DNS lookup triggered by the vulnerable system.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control a domain for which the target system performs a DNS TXT lookup, which can happen via reverse DNS lookup if no RSA key is configured for OE or by having the target perform a lookup for a domain the attacker controls. For exploitation where the system is correctly configured for OE with RSA key, the attacker only needs to trigger a connection to an IP address for which they control the reverse DNS zone.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when Opportunistic Encryption (`oe=yes`) is enabled in `/etc/ipsec.conf`. If no RSA key is configured for OE, the attacker must control the reverse DNS entry of the target system to trigger the issue. If an RSA key is configured, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending an email that triggers a DKIM or SPF DNS record lookup. The affected function is `atodn()`, which is called from `atoid()`."
