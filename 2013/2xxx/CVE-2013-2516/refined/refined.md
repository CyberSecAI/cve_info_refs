Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2013-2516:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `fileutils` Ruby gem has several vulnerabilities stemming from insecure file handling and command execution:

1.  **Insecure temporary directory creation:** The gem creates temporary directories within `/tmp` using predictable names based on file extensions (e.g., `/tmp/zip`). This makes the temporary directories vulnerable to hijacking by a malicious user.
2.  **Unsanitized URL input leading to command injection:** The `capture` function uses `CutyCapt` to capture screenshots of web pages. It does not sanitize the URL passed to `CutyCapt`, allowing an attacker to inject shell commands by including them in the URL.
3. **Unsanitized input to OpenOffice leading to command injection:** Similar to the `capture` function, input provided to OpenOffice for file conversions are not sanitized allowing for command injection through malicious filenames or input.
4.  **Predictable temporary file creation:** The `temp` function generates temporary file paths with a predictable pattern within `/tmp`. An attacker can create files or links at the expected paths before the script does, allowing them to overwrite arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The usage of `/tmp` for temporary file storage with predictable paths, combined with a lack of proper checks, makes it susceptible to symlink attacks and hijacking.
*   **Command Injection:** The lack of input sanitization when executing external commands (`CutyCapt` and OpenOffice) allows for arbitrary command execution via specially crafted URLs and file names.
*   **Predictable Temporary File Names:** The predictable naming of temporary files can lead to arbitrary file overwrites by creating files before the script runs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Through command injection vulnerabilities in `capture` and OpenOffice related code, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server running the vulnerable gem.
*   **File Overwrites:** By exploiting the predictable temporary file creation, an attacker can overwrite or manipulate existing files on the system, leading to denial of service or data corruption.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly stated, arbitrary command execution can potentially lead to information disclosure by executing commands that expose sensitive information.
* **Hijacking of Temporary Files**: By exploiting predictable temporary directory creation, a malicious user can hijack the directory and files contained within.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URLs:** An attacker can entice a user to click on a specially crafted URL containing shell commands that will be executed by `CutyCapt`.
*   **Malicious Filenames**: An attacker can provide filenames containing shell commands that will be executed during file conversions by OpenOffice.
*   **Local File System Manipulation:** An attacker with local access can create files or symlinks at predictable paths within `/tmp` before the vulnerable script runs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to entice a user into clicking a crafted URL:** To exploit the `CutyCapt` vulnerability
* **Ability to provide input to vulnerable functions:**  To exploit the OpenOffice vulnerability or to make use of the temporary file creation functions.
*   **Local System Access:** For exploiting the temporary file creation issues, an attacker requires the ability to create files on the system, typically user-level access.
*  **Ability to write to /tmp:** The attacker must have the ability to write to /tmp to hijack temp directories and files.
