  "cveId": "CVE-2013-2024",
  "description": "OS command injection vulnerability in the \"qs\" procedure from the \"utils\" module in Chicken before 4.9.0.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The `qs` procedure in the `utils` module of Chicken Scheme performs insufficient escaping of shell meta-characters. Specifically, it fails to properly escape pipe characters on Unix-like systems and quote characters on Windows systems. This is further exacerbated by relying on a blacklist of characters rather than a whitelist.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection",
       "Insufficient escaping of shell meta-characters"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary shell command execution with the privileges of the process running Chicken.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Injection of shell meta-characters in filenames or program arguments supplied to the `qs` procedure."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to control input that's passed to the `qs` procedure. This might be a filename, program argument, or some other string. No specific privileges or locations are needed beyond controlling the vulnerable input."

  ],
   "workarounds": "The best workaround for this problem for older Chicken versions is to avoid calling out to the shell. Instead, you can rely on the PROCESS-EXECUTE procedure from the posix module, or use the safe multi-argument version of the PROCESS[*] procedures, also from the posix module. If you require the shell's easy pipeline and redirection capabilities, you can use the scsh-process egg which uses PROCESS-EXECUTE under the hood."
