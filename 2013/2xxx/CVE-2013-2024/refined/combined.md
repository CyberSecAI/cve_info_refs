| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-04-30 08:53:29 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  I'd like to request a CVE identifier for a bug in Chicken Scheme which allows a malicious user to cause shell command execution through injection of a pipe symbol and possibly other shell meta characters.  This bug is present in all versions of CHICKEN.  It will be fixed in 4.8.3 and 4.8.2 as per commit 58684f69572453acc6fed7326fa9df39be98760e. Version 4.9.0 will likely be the first stable release to include this fix, unless it is decided to backport this fix to the stability release.  The full announcement is here: <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-announce/2013-04/msg00000.html>    @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please say explicitly if it is ready for the stabilization or not ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  erik falor    2013-04-30 21:53:02 UTC  ``` According to upstream, this will be fixed in Chicken 4.9.0 ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-07-03 21:59:48 UTC  ``` Patch available at [1].

See attached ebuild.  1. RDEPEND="emacs? ( virtual/emacs app-emacs/scheme-complete )"  While this 'works', by convention deps are listed one per line;  RDEPEND="emacs? ( virtual/emacs                    app-emacs/scheme-complete )"  2. if use "parallel-build" Use of conditional patching often receives negative critique. Unless the patch breaks the normal build, just patch it. With eclass eutils you can utilise var PATCHES, prior to src_prepare.  It reduces from 4 lines to one.  3. You can also reduce lines         defaults.make rules.make \       || die "sed failed"  to        defaults.make rules.make || die  I wonder if the 10 Makefiles of the 2nd statement can be reduced Makefile.*   Also the final two statements both edit the one file, defaults.make  sed "s,\$(PREFIX)/lib,\$(PREFIX)/$(get_libdir)," -i defaults.make || die "sed failed" sed "s,\$(DATADIR)/doc,\$(SHAREDIR)/doc/${P}," -i defaults.make || die "sed failed"  It's more common form is to use '- e'  (1 tab space)  sed -e "s first statement" \ (2 tab spaces)        -e  "s second statement" (2 tab spaces)        -i defaults.make  Functionally equivalent, on line longer; purely style. Listing so many Makefiles over 2 sed statements invites use of a patch instead.  All 4 statements address use of vars used by portage. A patch is cleaner and removes all sytax style issues.  The content I haven't runtested yet. I shall await an updated attachment.  Also such a tiny file doesn't require or warrant compression. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Ian Delaney (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2015-09-13 16:30:08 UTC  ``` In response to concern over [Bug 552202](show_bug.cgi?id=552202 "RESOLVED FIXED - <dev-scheme/chicken-4.10.0: out-of-bounds read in CHICKEN Scheme's string-translate* procedure (CVE-2015-4556)")  commit 2ba4fbcaa5f7a7983ab7d4fd3d13eb53c8d45d7a Author: Ian Delaney <idella4@gentoo.org> Date:   Mon Sep 14 00:23:34 2015 +0800      dev-scheme/chicken: bump to 4.10.0          ebuild and patch submitted by maintainer in sec [bug #467966](show_bug.cgi?id=467966 "RESOLVED FIXED - <dev-scheme/chicken-4.10.0-r1 : OS command injection vulnerability (CVE-2013-2024)")  No reply from maintainer at this point.

You're sure you wish to drop the use parallel-build and the patch? In my local copy I've edited around line 27 to          sed "s,A\(\s?=\|)\),chicken&," \                 -i Makefile.cross-linux-mingw defaults.make rules.make || die         sed "s,ARCH,zARCH," \                 -i Makefile.* defaults.make rules.make || die  The line was very long, the above is a convention used in writing sed statements. It has the benefit of reducing long lines > 80 chars which is a length recommended in ebuilds. Sometimes exceeding that can't be avoided.  In your adjusted ebuild you left in, re re-introduced, instances of "|| die" to helper functions. e.g. LINKER_OPTIONS="${LDFLAGS}" install || die belongs tpo emake from the previous line, & dodoc NEWS || die.  Await reply to this before moving. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  erik falor    2015-09-21 14:51:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ian Delaney from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=467966#c10)) > You're sure you wish to drop the use parallel-build and the patch?

The doc site is not "${D}"/usr/share/doc/${P}  but rather "${D}"usr/share/doc/${PF} so making a revbump, the docs are split between image/usr/share/doc/chicken-4.10.0  and image/usr/share/doc/chicken-4.10.0-r1  1. The ebuild now has docs to have README.bz2, NEWS.bz2. So you need set the var DOCS to capture them, either globally or with local in src_install(). 2. The LICENSE is better removed early on in src_prepare than src_install. 3. The auto install of the docs is nasty. Similarly, rather than remove them after they're installed, we remove them in src_prepare, so simply shift it to src_prepare, however the folder in ${S} is called manual-html. So edit rm -rf "${D}"usr/share/doc/${P}/manual to remove manual-html from ${S} 4. The install of the docs is then done within src_install with is use doc; then Use the helper func 'dodoc -r' which is the replacement to the defunct dohtml.  These are simple edits.  Install of docs and DOCS are fundamental steps and warrant these improvements. If removal of the pre-built docs under manual-html triggers error because they are hard coded and expected to be present, either leave as is or feel free to join the new channel in irc for further support.

```
Hello Chicken users,

It was discovered that the "qs" procedure from the "utils" module
performs incomplete escaping.  On Windows (mingw32), this procedure
quoted the string but did not escape embedded quote characters.
On Unix, this procedure did not escape the pipe character.  On both
systems, the procedure simply copied NULL characters in the input string
to the output string.  This last detail is less important, because all
procedures which pass the string to the shell contain a check for NUL
bytes.

Furthermore, this procedure relied on a blacklist of "special" shell
characters, which is considered bad practice as it is too easy to forget
a character and some shells have different rules as to which characters
are special.

What all this means in practice is that an attacker-supplied filename
or any other program argument can lead to arbitrary shell code execution
through OS command injection, which is exactly what qs intends to prevent.

This bug is present in all versions of CHICKEN prior to revision
58684f69572453acc6fed7326fa9df39be98760e, in which it was fixed by
switching to a whitelist approach on Unix and escaping quotes on Windows.
CHICKEN 4.9.0 will include this fix.

The best workaround for this problem for older Chicken versions is to
avoid calling out to the shell.  Instead, you can rely on the
PROCESS-EXECUTE procedure from the posix module, or use the safe
multi-argument version of the PROCESS[*] procedures, also from the posix
module.  If you require the shell's easy pipeline and redirection
capabilities, you can use the scsh-process egg which uses PROCESS-EXECUTE
under the hood.

You can also update to master 58684f69572453acc6fed7326fa9df39be98760e or
apply the patch at
<http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-hackers/2013-04/msg00060.html>

Many thanks to Florian Zumbiehl for pointing out the problem and
providing the initial patch.

Kind regards,
The CHICKEN Team

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

```
Package: chicken
Version: 4.5.0-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch

Hi,

@Release Team: This probably should not delay the release for wheezy, as
chicken has other security relevant bugreport open (#702410) with wheezy-ignore
tag. The same can be done here, IMO.

the following vulnerability was published for chicken.

[CVE-2013-2024](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2024)[0]:
OS command injection vulnerability in Chicken Scheme

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.

For further information and patch see:
