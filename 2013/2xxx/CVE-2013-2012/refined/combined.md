### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-04-25 19:31:07 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :    a security flaw was found in the way autojump, a tool for faster filesystem navigation from the command line, used to honour content of custom_install directory when global and local autojump installations were not found, and $SHELL variable was unset or set to different value than bash or zsh. If an unsuspecting autojump user was tricked into running autojump script from the directory a local attacker has write access to, this flaw could be used for arbitrary (Python) code execution with the privileges of the user running the autojump binary / script.  Relevant (final) upstream patches are as follows: [1] <https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/ad09ee27d402be797b3456abff6edeb4291edfec> [2] <https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/c763b2afadb188ab52849c21d43d2e8fe5b8800a>  References: [3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=950777>    @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please say explicitly if it is ready for the stabilization or not ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Michael Weber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-05-04 10:43:39 UTC  ``` +*autojump-21.3.0-r1 (04 May 2013) + +  04 May 2013; Michael Weber <xmw@gentoo.org> +autojump-21.3.0-r1.ebuild, +  +files/autojump-21.3.0-supported-shells.patch, -autojump-21.3.0.ebuild: +  Drop old, fix infinity loop sourcing shell=sh (thanks Kamil Kuduk, bug +  446312), prefix support (thanks Leho Kraav, [bug 465226](show_bug.cgi?id=465226 "RESOLVED FIXED - app-shells/autojump-21.1.0: add Prefix support to /etc/profile.d/autojump.sh")), fix security issue +  ([bug 467262](show_bug.cgi?id=467262 "RESOLVED FIXED - <app-shells/autojump-21.3.0-r1: autojump profile will load random stuff from a directory called custom_install (CVE-2013-2012)")). + ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sean Amoss (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-05-10 17:20:50 UTC  ``` Closing noglsa for ~arch only. ``` |  |

I you can forward the bug and patch upstream, by all means please do. Thank you.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=950777#c4)  William Ting    2013-04-24 20:45:01 UTC  ``` Zbigniew,  Thanks for the report. I've fixed the bug upstream in this commit:  <https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/ad09ee27d402be797b3456abff6edeb4291edfec>  The line shouldn't be removed due to other package managers depending on it for installation. If the global and local installations of autojump are not found, it now checks a random root directory.  If a user has write privileges to /, then all bets are off but hopefully this change is sufficient.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=950777#c5)  William Ting    2013-04-24 20:46:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 739596](attachment.cgi?id=739596&action=diff "Check \"/destdir_${RANDOM}_install\" location instead.")

If yes, then I am just not getting your patch, but that's ok :-)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=950777#c7)  Jan Pokorný [poki]    2013-04-24 21:10:47 UTC  ``` Ok, point of the code taken but it seems to be adding obscurity.  Wouldn't it be more decent to leave a special mark in form of a comment (like "### CUSTOMIZATION HERE ###" in the place to be conditionally modified in autojump.sh and then to substitute it with precooked "elif" block if customization required?  You can certainly do single line -> multiple lines mapping using sed:  $ echo "a" | sed 's|a|a\nb|'  a b   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=950777#c8)  William Ting    2013-04-25 00:07:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 739627](attachment.cgi?id=739627&action=diff "Uncomment else-if block only when --destdir is used during installation.")

Jan,  Stop being so sensible. :)  - William   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=950777#c9)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-04-25 15:52:59 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way autojump, a tool for faster filesystem navigation from the command line, used to honour content of custom_install directory when global and local autojump installations were not found and $SHELL variable was unset or set to different value than bash or zsh. If an unsuspecting autojump user was tricked into running autojump script from the directory a local attacker has write access to, this flaw could be used for arbitrary (Python) code execution with the privileges of the user running the autojump binary / script.
