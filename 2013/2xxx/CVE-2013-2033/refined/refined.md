- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a valid user account on Jenkins can execute JavaScript in the browser of other users.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must have a valid user account on Jenkins with write access. The attacker then can inject malicious javascript that will be executed in other users' browsers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a valid user account on the vulnerable Jenkins instance with write access. The vulnerability can be triggered when another user uses certain browsers to view the injected content.
