# CloudBees Security Advisory 2013-05-02

This advisory announces multiple security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.

**SECURITY-63 / CVE-2013-2034**

This creates a [cross-site request forgery (CSRF)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29) vulnerability on Jenkins master, where an anonymous attacker can trick an administrator to execute arbitrary code on Jenkins master by having him open a specifically crafted attack URL.

There's also a related vulnerability where the permission check on this ability is done imprecisely, which may affect those who are running Jenkins instances with a [custom authorization strategy](http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/security/AuthorizationStrategy.html) plugin.

**SECURITY-67 / CVE-2013-2033**

This creates a [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29) vulnerability, where an attacker with a valid user account on Jenkins can execute JavaScript in the browser of other users, if those users are using certain browsers.

**SECURITY-69 / CVE-2013-2034**

This is another CSRF vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause a deployment of binaries to Maven repositories. This vulnerability has the same CVE ID as SEUCRITY-63.

**SECURITY-71 / CVE-2013-1808**

This creates a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

### Severity

SECURITY-63 is rated **critical** , since it enables arbitrary code execution.

SECURITY-71 and SECURITY-69 are rated as **high** , as it allows malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the information and impersonate the administrator of the system. In addition, this allows Jenkins inside a firewall to be attacked from outside. On the other hands, this attack can be only mounted passively, and the attacker needs to know the URL of your Jenkins installations.

SECURITY-67 is rated **medium** , as it requires an attacker to be a valid user of Jenkins with a write access.

### Fix

* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.514
* LTS users should upgrade to 1.509.1
* Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.466.x should upgrade to 1.466.14.1
* Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.480.x should upgrade to 1.480.4.1
* Fix has already been deployed to DEV@cloud

All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.
