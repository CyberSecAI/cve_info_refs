### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.

## [Chicken-announce] [SECURITY] Incomplete fix for CVE-2012-6122 (select()

Hello CHICKEN users,

Recently, we fixed a problem related to the use of POSIX select(),
which was assigned CVE-2012-6122.
See <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-users/2012-06/msg00031.html>
for more details on the original bug.

We fixed the scheduler, but there remained other places in CHICKEN where
select() was still in use:

- The R5RS char-ready? procedure when invoked on stream ports or custom
   input ports created by the process procedure from unit posix (in *NIX)
- The tcp-accept-ready? procedure from unit tcp
- The file-select procedure from unit posix

These have now also been rewritten in terms of POSIX poll(), where
available.  This is on all supported platforms except Windows.
As before, there is no danger of buffer overrun on Windows, but
there is a situation where threads may never wake up.  There is no
known workaround.  A solution may be provided soon.

Currently all released versions of CHICKEN have this bug.  It has
been fixed in git master, commit 556108092774086b6c86c2e27daf3f740ffec091.
CHICKEN 4.9.0 will also include the bugfix.

The known workaround is still to limit the maximum number of open
descriptors using the Unix "ulimit -n" command, so that it matches the
value of FD_SETSIZE.  This value can be checked by compiling the
following one-line program with csc and running the resulting binary:

(print (foreign-value "FD_SETSIZE" int))

Kind regards,
The CHICKEN Team

```

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-05-11 09:53:56 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  I'd like to request a CVE for a select() fd_set buffer overrun problem in CHICKEN Scheme before 4.8.2 and all stable versions up to and including 4.8.0.3, on non-Windows systems.  The bug exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-6122.  Originally, only the userland thread scheduler's use of select() was rewritten to use POSIX poll().  It was later discovered by Florian Zumbiehl and Joerg Wittenberger that select() was still being used in three other places.  This bug is remotelye xploitable in networking code, under the right conditions (if the "ulimit -n" value exceeds FD_SETSIZE).  The announcement can be found at <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-announce/2013-05/msg00000.html>  There are two commits which together fix the bug: <http://code.call-cc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=chicken-core.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e2022652258e8a30e5cedbf0abc9cd85a0f6af7> <http://code.call-cc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=chicken-core.git;a=commitdiff;h=556108092774086b6c86c2e27daf3f740ffec091>    @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please say explicitly if it is ready for the stabilization or not ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Michael Weber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-07-08 13:41:27 UTC  ``` +*chicken-4.8.0.3-r1 (08 Jul 2013) + +  08 Jul 2013; Michael Weber <xmw@gentoo.org> +chicken-4.8.0.3-r1.ebuild, +  +files/chicken-4.8.0.3-CVE-2013-1874.patch, +  +files/chicken-4.8.0.3-CVE-2013-2024.patch, +  +files/chicken-4.8.0.3-CVE-2013-2075_1.patch, +  +files/chicken-4.8.0.3-CVE-2013-2075_2.patch: +  Revbump to include security patches (bugs [462458](show_bug.cgi?id=462458 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-scheme/chicken: Untrusted startup file inclusion (CVE-2013-1874)"), [469392](show_bug.cgi?id=469392 "RESOLVED FIXED - <dev-scheme/chicken-4.8.0.3-r1: Incomplete fix for CVE-2012-6122 (CVE-2013-2075)"), [467966](show_bug.cgi?id=467966 "RESOLVED FIXED - <dev-scheme/chicken-4.10.0-r1 : OS command injection vulnerability (CVE-2013-2024)")) + ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-08-29 17:15:35 UTC  ``` GLSA vote: no. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sergey Popov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-08-30 09:44:09 UTC  ``` GLSA vote: no  Closing as noglsa ``` |  |
