# Technology Preview Features - Scope of Support

Technology Preview features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling you to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. However, these features are not fully supported under Red Hat Subscription Level Agreements, may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use. As Red Hat considers making future iterations of Technology Preview features generally available, we will attempt to resolve any issues that customers experience when using these features.

During the development of a Technology Preview feature, additional components may become available to the public for testing. Because Technology Preview features are still under development, Red Hat cannot guarantee the stability of such features. As a result, if you are using Technology Preview features, you may not be able to seamlessly upgrade to subsequent releases of that feature. While Red Hat intends to fully support Technology Preview features in future releases, we may discover that a feature does not meet the standards for enterprise viability. If this happens, we cannot guarantee that Technology Preview features will be released in a supported manner. Some Technology Preview features may only be available for specific hardware architectures.

Red Hat Global Support Services may create bug reports on behalf of support cases filed by subscribed customers. These bug reports will then be forwarded to Red Hat Engineering as proposed for inclusion in a future release.

**NOTE:** Customers exploring Technology Preview content must accept that there may not be any migration path from the Developer Preview to General Availability (GA) release installations. A full installation of the GA version may be required and any customer data may be need to be migrated or may be lost.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=974259#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 19:22:44 UTC  ``` Willy Tarreau (w) reports:  Hi all,  a reproducible crash on latest haproxy snapshots was recently reported, and could finally be tracked down to a serious bug affecting all versions since 1.4.4.  The bug is in http_get_hdr() in haproxy 1.5, or get_ip_from_hdr2() in haproxy 1.4. If a configuration makes use of one of the following functions :     - hdr_ip(<name>, <value>)  (in 1.4)    - hdr_*(<name>, <value>)   (in 1.5)  with a negative <value>, then the configuration risks to crash when the request contains exactly MAX_HDR_HISTORY values for the header <name>.  Note: "source 0.0.0.0 usesrc hdr_ip(<name>)" uses -1 by default for <value> and is vulnerable as well !  The quick workaround I can suggest before patching is to reject dangerous requests early using hdr_cnt(<name>), which is available both in 1.4 and 1.5 :     block if { hdr_cnt(<name>) ge 10 }  Thus, I'm going to issue 1.5-dev19 and 1.4.24 with the following patch applied. 1.5-dev has not received significant updates recently and is of very little risk when migrating from dev17 or dev18.  The new version will probably be finished during the week-end with an announce on Monday morning european time. It leaves enough time to finish testing the last snapshots.  If anyone has any concern with the fix, please discuss it on the list so that we can find a quick solution together.  I'll request a CVE ID for this bug after the release. If any of the subscribers has a list of spare CVE IDs, feel free to propose one before the release, that way I'll update the commit message to report it.  Best regards, Willy -  From 20d1c2cb1c6fcfe1f74a79f15573223701903834 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 From: Willy Tarreau <w> Date: Wed, 12 Jun 2013 22:27:44 +0200 Subject: BUG/CRITICAL: fix a possible crash when using negative header  occurrences  When a config makes use of hdr_ip(x-forwarded-for,-1) or any such thing involving a negative occurrence count, the header is still parsed in the order it appears, and an array of up to MAX_HDR_HISTORY entries is created.

Hi all,

Here's an important update for 1.4 and 1.5, please read it, it contains
an important security fix.

When a config makes use of hdr_ip(x-forwarded-for,-1) or any such thing
involving a negative occurrence count, the header is still parsed in the
order it appears, and an array of up to MAX_HDR_HISTORY entries is created.
When more entries are used, the entries simply wrap and continue this way.

A problem happens when the incoming header field count exactly divides
MAX_HDR_HISTORY, because the computation removes the number of requested
occurrences from the count, but does not care about the risk of wrapping
with a negative number. Thus we can dereference the array with a negative
number and randomly crash the process.

The bug is located in http_get_hdr() in haproxy 1.5, and get_ip_from_hdr2()
in haproxy 1.4. It affects configurations making use of one of the following
functions with a negative <value> occurence number :

   - hdr_ip(<name>, <value>)  (in 1.4)
   - hdr_*(<name>, <value>)   (in 1.5)

It also affects "source" statements involving "hdr_ip(<name>)" since that
statement implicitly uses -1 for <value> :

   - source 0.0.0.0 usesrc hdr_ip(<name>)

A workaround consists in rejecting dangerous requests early using
hdr_cnt(<name>), which is available both in 1.4 and 1.5 :

   block if { hdr_cnt(<name>) ge 10 }

This bug has been present since the introduction of the negative offset
count in 1.4.4 via commit bce70882. It has been reported by David Torgerson
who offered some debugging traces showing where the crash happened, thus
making it significantly easier to find the bug!

CVE-2013-2175 was assigned to this bug.

For those who want to quickly deploy a fix, please use this patch for 1.5,
it also applies to 1.4 :

   <http://git.1wt.eu/web?p=haproxy.git;a=commitdiff;h=67dad2715b>

1.4.24 has only two other fixes from 1.4.23 :
  - BUG/MEDIUM: checks: disable TCP quickack when pure TCP checks are used
  - BUG/MAJOR: backend: consistent hash can loop forever in certain circumstances

For 1.5, no less than 28 bugs were fixed since 1.5-dev18, but as usual, either
you were not affected by them or were already using a more recent snapshot :-)

Bugs apart, 1.5 has received long-awaited updates, among which :

  - error reporting for acl/fetch was improved, log-format can now indicate
    where a bad keyword was detected ;

  - the stats page allow the output to be filtered to certain proxies only

  - transparent proxy is now supported on FreeBSD/OpenBSD

  - new ACL fetch full_hdr() works on a full header line, as opposed to
    hdr() which works on a comma-delimited list of values. This is useful
    with some new user-agents which include commas and could not be matched ;

  - health-checks try to drain server response first to avoid to emit a
    TCP reset whenever possible ;

  - new "http-response" rule sets allows some processing to be performed
    based on the response (eg: add/set header) ;

  - new actions for http-request/http-response :
    + set-nice : change the task's priority : allows high-bandwidth,
      low importance tasks to be deprioritized (useful for compression
      as well) ;

    + set-log-level : change the log level of current request, with
      possibility to completely disable it (eg: log POSTs with higher
      severity or stop logging statics, etc...) ;

    + set-tos : set the DSCP field of outgoing packets to the specified
      value. Can be useful to route certain responses over different
      links ;

    + set-mark : set a netfilter mark on all outgoing packets to the
      specified value. Can be used as an alternative to DSCP above, or
      to blacklist some IPs (when combined with ipset for example) ;

  - new action "expect-proxy layer4" for "tcp-request connection". This
    allows the PROXY protocol to be conditionally enabled on incoming
    connections. For example, when you rely on an external haproxy farm
    whose addresses are known, the PROXY protocol can be enabled just
    for them.

  - a new "env()" fetch keyword was added to retrieve an environment
    variable. This allows a same config to be used in various modes by
    just changing an environment variable during a reload (eg: prod/maint).
    Other usages include passing the Via header to servers.

  - stick-counters have been increased to 3 (sc0, sc1, sc2), because most
    often when combining to criteria, it was not possible to have both 1,
    2 and 1+2 at the same time.

  - ACL usage simplification : fetch methods of types boolean, integer
    or IP address are automatically usable in ACLs without having to
    specify "-m $type". This permitted to significantly clean the code
    by removing many double references to same keywords. Contributors
    will probably appreciated.

  - the ACL/fetch doc experienced a major lift up to avoid referencing the
    same keywords twice. It was by far the hardest change of this whole
    version!

I receive about twice a week a question asking "when will 1.5 become stable ?".

We're still focusing primarily on this task, but the changes introduced in
last september had a lot of impact and were not trivial to fix. Server-side
keep-alive is still the condition to switch to 1.5-stable. In the mean time,
some issues with buffer management still need to be adressed in order to be
able to fix compression (which is disabled for chunked encoding right now).
Another big deal is to propagate the process binding to listeners to fix some
issues with peers and stats socket in multi-process mode. I already have
patches for this but they're broken, dependencies are too deep and they need
to be redesigned. The rest is not very important and can be postponed.

It seems reasonable to think about 1.5-stable by the end of the summer, so
all in all it's as always "in 3 months"... The good thing is that I'm getting
more time dedicated to this task at Exceliance, so this never-ending promise
might become true.

## Synopsis

Moderate: haproxy security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1204)

## Topic

An updated haproxy package that fixes one security issue is now available
for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.2.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

HAProxy provides high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP
and HTTP-based applications.

A flaw was found in the way HAProxy handled requests when the proxy's
configuration ("/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg") had certain rules that use the
hdr\_ip criterion. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash HAProxy
instances that use the affected configuration. (CVE-2013-2175)

In Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise, the HAProxy cartridge is added to your
application when you select to have your application scaled.

Red Hat would like to thank HAProxy upstream for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges David Torgerson as the original reporter.

Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.2 are advised to upgrade to this
updated package, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=974259#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-13 19:22:44 UTC  ``` Willy Tarreau (w) reports:  Hi all,  a reproducible crash on latest haproxy snapshots was recently reported, and could finally be tracked down to a serious bug affecting all versions since 1.4.4.  The bug is in http_get_hdr() in haproxy 1.5, or get_ip_from_hdr2() in haproxy 1.4. If a configuration makes use of one of the following functions :     - hdr_ip(<name>, <value>)  (in 1.4)    - hdr_*(<name>, <value>)   (in 1.5)  with a negative <value>, then the configuration risks to crash when the request contains exactly MAX_HDR_HISTORY values for the header <name>.  Note: "source 0.0.0.0 usesrc hdr_ip(<name>)" uses -1 by default for <value> and is vulnerable as well !  The quick workaround I can suggest before patching is to reject dangerous requests early using hdr_cnt(<name>), which is available both in 1.4 and 1.5 :     block if { hdr_cnt(<name>) ge 10 }  Thus, I'm going to issue 1.5-dev19 and 1.4.24 with the following patch applied. 1.5-dev has not received significant updates recently and is of very little risk when migrating from dev17 or dev18.  The new version will probably be finished during the week-end with an announce on Monday morning european time. It leaves enough time to finish testing the last snapshots.  If anyone has any concern with the fix, please discuss it on the list so that we can find a quick solution together.  I'll request a CVE ID for this bug after the release. If any of the subscribers has a list of spare CVE IDs, feel free to propose one before the release, that way I'll update the commit message to report it.  Best regards, Willy -  From 20d1c2cb1c6fcfe1f74a79f15573223701903834 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 From: Willy Tarreau <w> Date: Wed, 12 Jun 2013 22:27:44 +0200 Subject: BUG/CRITICAL: fix a possible crash when using negative header  occurrences  When a config makes use of hdr_ip(x-forwarded-for,-1) or any such thing involving a negative occurrence count, the header is still parsed in the order it appears, and an array of up to MAX_HDR_HISTORY entries is created. When more entries are used, the entries simply wrap and continue this way.  A problem happens when the incoming header field count exactly divides MAX_HDR_HISTORY, because the computation removes the number of requested occurrences from the count, but does not care about the risk of wrapping with a negative number. Thus we can dereference the array with a negative number and randomly crash the process.  This bug has been present since the introduction of the negative offset count in 1.4.4 via commit bce70882. It has been reported by David Torgerson who offered some debugging traces showing where the crash happened, thus making it significantly easier to find the bug!  This fix must absolutely be backported to 1.4.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=974259#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-17 17:56:23 UTC  ``` This issue is now public:  <http://marc.info/?l=haproxy&m=137147915029705&w=2>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=974259#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2013-06-17 18:04:11 UTC  ``` Created haproxy tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 975160](show_bug.cgi?id=975160 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2175 haproxy: http_get_hdr()/get_ip_from_hdr2() MAX_HDR_HISTORY handling denial of service [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=974259#c6)  Fedora Update System    2013-06-28 06:14:28 UTC  ``` haproxy-1.4.24-1.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1120)

## Topic

An updated haproxy package that fixes one security issue is now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

HAProxy provides high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP
and HTTP-based applications.

A flaw was found in the way HAProxy handled requests when the proxy's
configuration ("/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg") had certain rules that use the
hdr\_ip criterion. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash HAProxy
instances that use the affected configuration. (CVE-2013-2175)

Red Hat would like to thank HAProxy upstream for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges David Torgerson as the original reporter.

HAProxy is released as a Technology Preview in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
More information about Red Hat Technology Previews is available at
<https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/>

All users of haproxy are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Packages

* [haproxy](/security/cves?package=haproxy) - fast and reliable load balancing reverse proxy

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
