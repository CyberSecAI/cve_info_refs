The provided content is related to CVE-2013-2109.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `eval()` in the `wpCleanFixAjax.php` file of the WordPress wp-cleanfix plugin. The plugin takes a `command` parameter from user input, strips HTML tags, and then executes it using `eval()`. This allows for arbitrary PHP code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe use of `eval()`.
- Lack of proper input sanitization beyond stripping HTML tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary PHP code execution. An attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the WordPress installation and the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=wpCleanFixAjax` parameter.
- It requires a POST request with a `command` parameter containing the PHP code to be executed.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the user is logged in as an administrator, but because of a separate CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2013-2108), the attack can be carried out remotely without prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- Due to the CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2013-2108), the attacker can exploit this issue without having valid administrative credentials.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious `command` parameter containing PHP code.

**Additional details not found in the CVE description:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through a CSRF attack (CVE-2013-2108), making the exploit possible for remote unauthenticated attackers.
