How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [Super useful. Must have!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/super-useful-must-have/)

[ttytyper](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ttytyper/ "Posts by ttytyper")
April 21, 2020

I kept forgetting to check updates because the small site I help run rarely receives new content. As a result, we got unwelcome visitors.
Mail On Update solves the problem beautifully. Instead of me having to remember to check for updates on a regular basis, I now get a notification when my attention is needed.
In my opinion this functionality should be part of Wordpress core. It’s odd that WP offers email notifications when people post comments, but not for something as important as updates.
From what I can tell, MOU does not check for theme or core updates. They are also important, so it would be nice if they could be checked as well.

### [Very useful plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/very-useful-plugin-373/)

[lucieku](https://profiles.wordpress.org/lucieku/ "Posts by lucieku")
February 24, 2017

Very useful plugin.
Two suggestions:
Currently the plugin also sends emails for all of my disabled plugins. It would be nice if you would only send notifications for enabled plugins as it doesn’t make sense to continuously update disabled plugins.
The email reminders contain a link to http://MYSITE/wp-admin/plugins.php. It would be nice if this would be a https link so that you don’t accidentially submit your login credentials through an unsecured connection.
Keep up the good work!
