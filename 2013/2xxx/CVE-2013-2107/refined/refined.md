Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the "Mail On Update" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not properly validate the origin of requests when saving the "List of alternative recipients" setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The plugin lacks protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious request that, when submitted by an authenticated user, will modify plugin settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Email redirection:** An attacker can add arbitrary email addresses to the "List of alternative recipients" in the plugin settings. This means that instead of the intended administrator receiving plugin update notifications, the attacker will receive them.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could gain knowledge of available plugin updates, which might be used to further exploit the site.
- **Spam:** The attacker could also utilize this to spam email addresses using the victim's server, as the email address list is not checked.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying the recipient list, legitimate users may be unable to receive important plugin updates, causing a disruption in system administration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTML Form:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in WordPress user, silently modifies the plugin's email recipient settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Attacker Position:** The attacker can be external to the target WordPress installation.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated WordPress user (administrator) into visiting a webpage controlled by the attacker. The user must be logged into the target WordPress site at the time.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided in the form of an HTML form.
- The vulnerability was tested on version 5.1.0 of the "mail-on-update" plugin.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to receive notifications about available plugin updates, which are intended for the administrator.
- The attacker can potentially use this to spam people or for other malicious purposes.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to change notification settings, potentially causing DoS for administrators.
