The provided content relates to CVE-2013-2628.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the `action.php` file of the Leed (Light Feed) application. Specifically, none of the actions performed within `action.php` require a token to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing CSRF protection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute malicious actions on behalf of a logged-in Leed administrator.
- This occurs if the victim clicks on a malicious link or visits a website under the attacker's control.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious link sent to a logged-in Leed user.
- A website controlled by the attacker which the victim visits.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to entice a logged-in Leed admin to click on a malicious link or visit a website they control.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated in the Leed application.
