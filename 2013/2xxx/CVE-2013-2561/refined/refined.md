  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ibutils utility creates several temporary files in the /tmp directory without properly handling symbolic links. This allows a malicious local user to create symlinks in /tmp to arbitrary files, which will then be overwritten when ibutils is run by a privileged user (typically root).",

      "Insecure handling of temporary files in /tmp",

      "Local symlink attack"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A malicious local user with the ability to create symlinks in the /tmp directory. The attacker must also be able to convince a privileged user (usually root) to execute the vulnerable ibutils utility."
