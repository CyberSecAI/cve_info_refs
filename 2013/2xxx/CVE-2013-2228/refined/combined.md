Subject: CVE-2013-2228 : Salt Stack RSA exponent of 1 (there can be only one!
 da-na-naaah! na-na-na-naahh-nah-nahhh!)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

<https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/5dd304276ba5745ec21fc1e6686a0b28da29e6fc>

This is indeed CVE worthy, for example we have CVE-2006-7140 and
CVE-2011-4121 for RSA exponent 3, so RSA exponent 1 definitely qualifies.

Please use CVE-2013-2228 for the RSA exponent of 1 in Salt Stack

# 2.3. Understanding a Bug[¶](#understanding-a-bug "Link to this heading")

The core of Bugzilla is the screen which displays a particular
bug. Note that the labels for most fields are hyperlinks;
clicking them will take you to context-sensitive help on that
particular field. Fields marked \* may not be present on every
installation of Bugzilla.

*Summary:*

A one-sentence summary of the problem, displayed in the header next to
the bug number.

*Status (and Resolution):*

These define exactly what state the bug is in—from not even
being confirmed as a bug, through to being fixed and the fix
confirmed by Quality Assurance. The different possible values for
Status and Resolution on your installation should be documented in the
context-sensitive help for those items.

*Alias:*

A unique short text name for the bug, which can be used instead of the
bug number.

*Product and Component*:

Bugs are divided up by Product and Component, with a Product
having one or more Components in it.

*Version:*

The “Version” field usually contains the numbers or names of released
versions of the product. It is used to indicate the version(s) affected by
the bug report.

*Hardware (Platform and OS):*

These indicate the computing environment where the bug was
found.

*Importance (Priority and Severity):*

The Priority field is used to prioritize bugs, either by the assignee,
or someone else with authority to direct their time such as a project
manager. It’s a good idea not to change this on other people’s bugs. The
default values are P1 to P5.

The Severity field indicates how severe the problem is—from blocker
(“application unusable”) to trivial (“minor cosmetic issue”). You
can also use this field to indicate whether a bug is an enhancement
request.

*\*Target Milestone:*

A future version by which the bug is to
be fixed. e.g. The Bugzilla Project’s milestones for future
Bugzilla versions are 4.4, 5.0, 6.0, etc. Milestones are not
restricted to numbers, though—you can use any text strings, such
as dates.

*Assigned To:*

The person responsible for fixing the bug.

*\*QA Contact:*

The person responsible for quality assurance on this bug.

*URL:*

A URL associated with the bug, if any.

*\*Whiteboard:*

A free-form text area for adding short notes and tags to a bug.

*Keywords:*

The administrator can define keywords which you can use to tag and
categorise bugs—e.g. `crash` or `regression`.

*Personal Tags:*

Unlike Keywords which are global and visible by all users, Personal Tags
are personal and can only be viewed and edited by their author. Editing
them won’t send any notifications to other users. Use them to tag and keep
track of sets of bugs that you personally care about, using your own
classification system.

*Dependencies (Depends On and Blocks):*

If this bug cannot be fixed unless other bugs are fixed (depends
on), or this bug stops other bugs being fixed (blocks), their
numbers are recorded here.

Clicking the Dependency tree link shows
the dependency relationships of the bug as a tree structure.
You can change how much depth to show, and you can hide resolved bugs
from this page. You can also collapse/expand dependencies for
each non-terminal bug on the tree view, using the [-]/[+] buttons that
appear before the summary.

*Reported:*

The person who filed the bug, and the date and time they did it.

*Modified:*

The date and time the bug was last changed.

*CC List:*

A list of people who get mail when the bug changes, in addition to the
Reporter, Assignee and QA Contact (if enabled).

*Ignore Bug Mail:*

Set this if you want never to get bugmail from this bug again. See also
[Email Preferences](preferences.html#emailpreferences).

*\*See Also:*

Bugs, in this Bugzilla, other Bugzillas, or other bug trackers, that are
related to this one.

*Flags:*

A flag is a kind of status that can be set on bugs or attachments
to indicate that the bugs/attachments are in a certain state.
Each installation can define its own set of flags that can be set
on bugs or attachments. See [Flags](#flags).

*\*Time Tracking:*

This form can be used for time tracking.
To use this feature, you have to be a member of the group
specified by the timetrackinggroup parameter. See
[Time Tracking](editing.html#time-tracking) for more information.

Orig. Est.:

This field shows the original estimated time.

Current Est.:

This field shows the current estimated time.
This number is calculated from `Hours Worked`
and `Hours Left`.

Hours Worked:

This field shows the number of hours worked.

Hours Left:

This field shows the `Current Est.` -
`Hours Worked`.
This value + `Hours Worked` will become the
new Current Est.

%Complete:

This field shows what percentage of the task is complete.

Gain:

This field shows the number of hours that the bug is ahead of the
`Orig. Est.`.

Deadline:

This field shows the deadline for this bug.

*Attachments:*

You can attach files (e.g. test cases or patches) to bugs. If there
are any attachments, they are listed in this section. See
[Attachments](editing.html#attachments) for more information.

*Additional Comments:*

You can add your two cents to the bug discussion here, if you have
something worthwhile to say.

## 2.3.1. Flags[¶](#flags "Link to this heading")

Flags are a way to attach a specific status to a bug or attachment,
either `+` or `-`. The meaning of these symbols depends on the name of
the flag itself, but contextually they could mean pass/fail,
accept/reject, approved/denied, or even a simple yes/no. If your site
allows requestable flags, then users may set a flag to `?` as a
request to another user that they look at the bug/attachment and set
the flag to its correct status.

A set flag appears in bug reports and on “edit attachment” pages with the
abbreviated username of the user who set the flag prepended to the
flag name. For example, if Jack sets a “review” flag to `+`, it appears
as Jack: review [ + ].

A requested flag appears with the user who requested the flag prepended
to the flag name and the user who has been requested to set the flag
appended to the flag name within parentheses. For example, if Jack
asks Jill for review, it appears as Jack: review [ ? ] (Jill).

You can browse through open requests made of you and by you by selecting
My Requests from the footer. You can also look at open requests
limited by other requesters, requestees, products, components, and flag names.
Note that you can use ‘-’ for requestee to specify flags with no requestee
set.

### 2.3.1.1. A Simple Example[¶](#a-simple-example "Link to this heading")

A developer might want to ask their manager,
“Should we fix this bug before we release version 2.0?”
They might want to do this for a *lot* of bugs,
so they decide to streamline the process. So:

1. The Bugzilla administrator creates a flag type called blocking2.0 for bugs
   in your product. It shows up on the Show Bug screen as the text
   blocking2.0 with a drop-down box next to it. The drop-down box
   contains four values: an empty space, `?`, `-`, and `+`.
2. The developer sets the flag to `?`.
3. The manager sees the blocking2.0
   flag with a `?` value.
4. If the manager thinks the feature should go into the product
   before version 2.0 can be released, they set the flag to
   `+`. Otherwise, they set it to `-`.
5. Now, every Bugzilla user who looks at the bug knows whether or
   not the bug needs to be fixed before release of version 2.0.

### 2.3.1.2. About Flags[¶](#about-flags "Link to this heading")

Flags can have four values:

`?`

A user is requesting that a status be set. (Think of it as ‘A question is being asked’.)

`-`

The status has been set negatively. (The question has been answered `no`.)

`+`

The status has been set positively.
(The question has been answered `yes`.)

`_`

`unset` actually shows up as a blank space. This just means that nobody
has expressed an opinion (or asked someone else to express an opinion)
about the matter covered by this flag.

### 2.3.1.3. Flag Requests[¶](#flag-requests "Link to this heading")

If a flag has been defined as requestable, and a user has enough
privileges to request it (see below), the user can set the flag’s status to
`?`. This status indicates that someone (a.k.a. “the requester”) is asking
someone else to set the flag to either `+` or `-`.

If a flag has been defined as specifically requestable,
a text box will appear next to the flag into which the requester may
enter a Bugzilla username. That named person (a.k.a. “the requestee”)
will receive an email notifying them of the request, and pointing them
to the bug/attachment in question.

If a flag has *not* been defined as specifically requestable,
then no such text box will appear. A request to set this flag cannot be made
of any specific individual; these requests are open for anyone to answer. In
Bugzilla this is known as “asking the wind”. A requester may ask the wind on
any flag simply by leaving the text box blank.

### 2.3.1.4. Attachment Flags[¶](#attachment-flags "Link to this heading")

There are two types of flags: bug flags and attachment flags.

Attachment flags are used to ask a question about a specific
attachment on a bug.

Many Bugzilla installations use this to
request that one developer review another
developer’s code before they check it in. They attach the code to
a bug report, and then set a flag on that attachment called
review to
review? reviewer@example.com.
reviewer@example.com is then notified by email that
they have to check out that attachment and approve it or deny it.

For a Bugzilla user, attachment flags show up in three places:

1. On the list of attachments in the Show Bug
   screen, you can see the current state of any flags that
   have been set to `?`, `+`, or `-`. You can see who asked about
   the flag (the requester), and who is being asked (the
   requestee).
2. When you edit an attachment, you can
   see any settable flag, along with any flags that have
   already been set. The Edit Attachment
   screen is where you set flags to `?`, `-`, `+`, or unset them.
3. Requests are listed in the Request Queue, which
   is accessible from the My Requests link (if you are
   logged in) or Requests link (if you are logged out)
   visible on all pages.

### 2.3.1.5. Bug Flags[¶](#bug-flags "Link to this heading")

Bug flags are used to set a status on the bug itself. You can
see Bug Flags in the Show Bug and Requests
screens, as described above.

Only users with enough privileges (see below) may set flags on bugs.
This doesn’t necessarily include the assignee, reporter, or users with the
editbugs permission.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

### [amd64 – Advanced choices](#amd64-advanced)

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *amd64* architecture is intended for use on AMD 64-bit CPUs as well as 64-bit **Intel Pentium/Core/Xeon** processors.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

Edit: This user does not represent the Salt project or Salt Stack

Just to clarify, this is about the public exponent, *not* keysize.

It's of course [questionable whether 1 (not a prime) was a good choice for the exponent](http://security.stackexchange.com/a/2339) to begin with, but it's hardly necessary to [lose faith over this](https://twitter.com/svs/status/350367599210663936).

As for the padding, that is [properly done on encryption](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/5dd304276ba5745ec21fc1e6686a0b28da29e6fc/salt/crypt.py#L346-L350).

So, all in all: good this was changed, but the world wasn't doomed before either.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hehe, I was about to whack the Wikipedia article at you, but this isn't the issue.

Your explanation is sound, and I will just have to take your word, because quite frankly, I am not the professional cryptographer you want. I know crypto, but on a far higher level than mathematics. ;)

The commit should have fixed this once and for all, right?

Given that there were no reported compromises, there is no damage.

I am sure that Salt will at one point undergo an audit, that is if we don't change it all to SSH before (which we might well not). Would you want to volunteer?

Sorry, something went wrong.

Can I ask you to take a moment in Python or Ruby or something to actually try doing RSA with e=1?

RSA encryption is m^e%p. If e is 1, what is m^e%p?

Why was 65537 selected? Assuming correct padding and the 2048-bit RSA key size which I believe is your default, a smaller exponent like 3, would seem a better choice.

Sorry, something went wrong.

You should probably add 1 just to be safe and use 4.

You don't want to get bit by that trailing null.

e=3 is not a great choice; in the presence of other vulnerabilities, there are exploits that are easier to write on very-low-exponent RSA. 2^16+1 is the correct conservative choice.

[@tqbf](https://github.com/tqbf): surely, 65537 is better (and slower) than 3, but I fail to answer your earlier question because I don't know the precedence rules of ^ vs. % off the top of my head. ;)

Thanks for all the input.

A professional cryptographer did find this fault and evaluated the entire crypto sequence. This audit is what resulted in this change and the number selected was the recommended value to use.

With that said we are open to and continually seeking more analysis of the routines used.

Also, while I did not want to reveal it quite yet, I am working on an optional ssh transport system for Salt allowing Salt to run using just the ssh agent, although, of course, this makes Salt MUCH slower.

In the end, there are no known issues with the crypto in Salt today, and all security issues have been taken care of quickly, and publicly announced.

No, the cryptographer never told us that 1 was ok, he told us that the best choice was 65537 and that we should change it from 1 ASAP, which we did.

I think the larger question here is: why aren't you using TLS?

I will warn you in advance that "because we're using ZeroMQ" is a silly answer. This is at least the third vulnerability that has been found in your homebrew transport encryption, after the lack of a MAC and a timing attack. I hope you now realize that homebrewing your own transport encryption is a bad idea and you should seriously consider switching to TLS at this point to avoid future attacks.

I agree and am looking into working TLS into Salt, it is also noteworthy that we are actively working on an ssh transport system.

We are always looking for help and would appreciate help with getting TLS working in Salt and with ZeroMQ.

Ansible has a "fireball" mode by which they start a 0mq listener through SSH, but that does not actually solve the problem of the security of the 0mq channel.

I am 100% for TLS. SSH is a nice idea too, but probably will be too slow. Good to have as an option for small changes and bootstrapping though.

It's a shame 0mq doesn't do TLS itself.

[@madduck](https://github.com/madduck): think of m^e%p as `pow(m, e, p)`. *m* raised to an exponent of *1* will always be *m*, when *m* is less than *p*.

@kseifriedredhat, yes, I submitted this to mitre right away, they allocated a CVE for it, but I must have dropped the ball somewhere since the CVE number that was given was not used on their end.

Maybe because of this <http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg06063.html> ? e.g. [CVE-2006-4340](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q7vf-rjwh-chxv "CVE-2006-4340") - AFAIK this was due to an implementation error of RSA and not a vulnerability of RSA itself.

e=3 is vuln to chinese remaindering: If you have three keys having e=3, modulus N1, N2, N3 and one message is encrypted using each key, then chinese remaindering allows calculating mod N1 x N2 x N3 and using an ordinary (continuous) cubic root.

Please PM me if you have questions on this.

Yes, I saw that. I don't know much about 0MQ, but it looks to me like a good case for DTLS. Its usage is not as widespread as TLS, but it's still much better than a homegrown encrypted transport protocol.

What [@yanosz](https://github.com/yanosz) explained is basically [Coppersmith's Attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%27s_Attack). The model of the attack involves low `e` such that the number of parties participating in the common encryption of a substantially similar plaintext is greater than or equal to `e`. IIRC, in this case, decryption can be performed without `d`, `p` or `q` in polynomial time... which is a Big Deal.

Well, about the homegrown encryption, all known vulnerabilities have been addressed. We can't assume it's bad just because of that, right?

Known vulnerabilities having been addressed doesn't mean there aren't many more not yet found. Furthermore, why waste time maintaining an encrypted transport protocol at all (regardless of the wisdom of doing so), when it would (eventually) be less work to use an established protocol.

[@listrophy](https://github.com/listrophy) A corollary to that is if you have a "web scale" crypto system with more than 2^16+1 users and you use encrypted broadcasts your system may be vulnerable if enough of those individually encrypted broadcasts are hoovered up by an attacker (aka NSA).

You never encrypt the exact same message to more than one person in RSA, nor do you ever encrypt deterministically. This is an example of where e=3 makes a vulnerability that already exists easy to exploit, but not an example of an e=3 vulnerability. It's also the reason we have OAEP ("modern" RSA encryption). If you're passing plaintext directly to modexp to implement RSA encryption, you're boned no matter what public exponent you use.

[@mattkeenan](https://github.com/mattkeenan) --- that is a corollary only if you are using RSA unsafely to begin with. In a competent RSA design, you'd never be passing deterministic plaintext directly to RSA; every message would be different by dint of padding. You must not ever use RSA without a secure padding scheme. RSA padding is not like block cipher padding; it's not a nicety, but instead absolutely required for the security of the system.

Yeah. This stuff changes fast - I remember an older copy of applied crypto used to recommend e=3, and then the text that I was using for crypto course explained what's wrong with e=3.

In response to this issue, [@thatch45](https://github.com/thatch45) has opened an issue to further improve salt's security model in the 0.17 release due mid-July:

[#5913](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/5913)

"A few things to bring up here. First off, cryptography alone is not considered sufficient security, it is unwise to, for instance, expose ssh on the internet. Salt is a command and control system, it is unwise to expose ANY such system to the internet without aggressive firewall rules (any config management system, a system that contains code that manages a config management system or a system that contains keys allowing access to command and control systems)."

@kseifriedredhat Sounds like these are the approaches [@thatch45](https://github.com/thatch45) is considering in the next release ( 0.17, due mid-July 2013 ) to enhance the system security:

"The main goals in my mind with the present crypto in Salt are these:

1. Change to use a lib where someone else maintains the crypto backend (libssh, paramiko, nacl, keyczar, libzmqCurve(very new, needs investigation), (pycrypto does a much better job of this now then when I first wrote Salt and we may be able to just lean entirely on pycrypto)). The question of us keeping up with the changes in the crypto world is of the greatest concern.
2. Get rid of M2Crypto - this is unmaintained and not python3 compatible
3. Keep the ssh like approach to keys (WAY easier to manage and less prone to user error - perhaps the most common cause for security breaches)
4. Enable a pure ssh agent based system for Salt that does not require installing minions or masters at all (in the works - as in it kind of works in git right now - but can't use the awesome ZeroMQ power that makes Salt so amazing - read: slow, no peer system, no syndic, no mine etc.)"

Could 1. be "switch to OpenSSL-provided TLS"? TLS key handling can function like SSH's with a little massaging, so it's not fundamentally a worse user experience.

TLS ought to be avoided for it's inherent complexity and unresolved issues / limited (secure) crypto configuration.

aside from an ssh-based tunnel, the proper solution here is to see through enhancements to libzmq or outsourcing salt's crypto to a more common library like NaCl/pycrypto/etc/

Edit: This user does not represent the Salt project or Salt Stack

Just to clarify, this is about the public exponent, *not* keysize.

It's of course [questionable whether 1 (not a prime) was a good choice for the exponent](http://security.stackexchange.com/a/2339) to begin with, but it's hardly necessary to [lose faith over this](https://twitter.com/svs/status/350367599210663936).

As for the padding, that is [properly done on encryption](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/5dd304276ba5745ec21fc1e6686a0b28da29e6fc/salt/crypt.py#L346-L350).

So, all in all: good this was changed, but the world wasn't doomed before either.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hehe, I was about to whack the Wikipedia article at you, but this isn't the issue.

Your explanation is sound, and I will just have to take your word, because quite frankly, I am not the professional cryptographer you want. I know crypto, but on a far higher level than mathematics. ;)

The commit should have fixed this once and for all, right?

Given that there were no reported compromises, there is no damage.

I am sure that Salt will at one point undergo an audit, that is if we don't change it all to SSH before (which we might well not). Would you want to volunteer?

Can I ask you to take a moment in Python or Ruby or something to actually try doing RSA with e=1?

RSA encryption is m^e%p. If e is 1, what is m^e%p?

Why was 65537 selected? Assuming correct padding and the 2048-bit RSA key size which I believe is your default, a smaller exponent like 3, would seem a better choice.

You should probably add 1 just to be safe and use 4.

You don't want to get bit by that trailing null.

e=3 is not a great choice; in the presence of other vulnerabilities, there are exploits that are easier to write on very-low-exponent RSA. 2^16+1 is the correct conservative choice.

[@tqbf](https://github.com/tqbf): surely, 65537 is better (and slower) than 3, but I fail to answer your earlier question because I don't know the precedence rules of ^ vs. % off the top of my head. ;)

Thanks for all the input.

A professional cryptographer did find this fault and evaluated the entire crypto sequence. This audit is what resulted in this change and the number selected was the recommended value to use.

With that said we are open to and continually seeking more analysis of the routines used.

Also, while I did not want to reveal it quite yet, I am working on an optional ssh transport system for Salt allowing Salt to run using just the ssh agent, although, of course, this makes Salt MUCH slower.

In the end, there are no known issues with the crypto in Salt today, and all security issues have been taken care of quickly, and publicly announced.

No, the cryptographer never told us that 1 was ok, he told us that the best choice was 65537 and that we should change it from 1 ASAP, which we did.

I think the larger question here is: why aren't you using TLS?

I will warn you in advance that "because we're using ZeroMQ" is a silly answer. This is at least the third vulnerability that has been found in your homebrew transport encryption, after the lack of a MAC and a timing attack. I hope you now realize that homebrewing your own transport encryption is a bad idea and you should seriously consider switching to TLS at this point to avoid future attacks.

I agree and am looking into working TLS into Salt, it is also noteworthy that we are actively working on an ssh transport system.

We are always looking for help and would appreciate help with getting TLS working in Salt and with ZeroMQ.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Ansible has a "fireball" mode by which they start a 0mq listener through SSH, but that does not actually solve the problem of the security of the 0mq channel.

I am 100% for TLS. SSH is a nice idea too, but probably will be too slow. Good to have as an option for small changes and bootstrapping though.

It's a shame 0mq doesn't do TLS itself.

[@madduck](https://github.com/madduck): think of m^e%p as `pow(m, e, p)`. *m* raised to an exponent of *1* will always be *m*, when *m* is less than *p*.

```
 >>> pow(int('ABC'.encode('hex'), 16), 1, p)
4276803L
>>> ("%x" % _).decode('hex')
'ABC'

@kseifriedredhat, yes, I submitted this to mitre right away, they allocated a CVE for it, but I must have dropped the ball somewhere since the CVE number that was given was not used on their end. I am conversing with Mitre to make sure that this does not happen again and that future security issues get CVEs allocated correctly.

Maybe because of this <http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg06063.html> ? e.g. [CVE-2006-4340](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q7vf-rjwh-chxv "CVE-2006-4340") - AFAIK this was due to an implementation error of RSA and not a vulnerability of RSA itself.

e=3 is vuln to chinese remaindering: If you have three keys having e=3, modulus N1, N2, N3 and one message is encrypted using each key, then chinese remaindering allows calculating mod N1 x N2 x N3 and using an ordinary (continuous) cubic root.

Yes, I saw that. I don't know much about 0MQ, but it looks to me like a good case for DTLS. Its usage is not as widespread as TLS, but it's still much better than a homegrown encrypted transport protocol.

What [@yanosz](https://github.com/yanosz) explained is basically [Coppersmith's Attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%27s_Attack). The model of the attack involves low `e` such that the number of parties participating in the common encryption of a substantially similar plaintext is greater than or equal to `e`. IIRC, in this case, decryption can be performed without `d`, `p` or `q` in polynomial time... which is a Big Deal.

Known vulnerabilities having been addressed doesn't mean there aren't many more not yet found. Furthermore, why waste time maintaining an encrypted transport protocol at all (regardless of the wisdom of doing so), when it would (eventually) be less work to use an established protocol.

[@listrophy](https://github.com/listrophy) A corollary to that is if you have a "web scale" crypto system with more than 2^16+1 users and you use encrypted broadcasts your system may be vulnerable if enough of those individually encrypted broadcasts are hoovered up by an attacker (aka NSA).

You never encrypt the exact same message to more than one person in RSA, nor do you ever encrypt deterministically. This is an example of where e=3 makes a vulnerability that already exists easy to exploit, but not an example of an e=3 vulnerability. It's also the reason we have OAEP ("modern" RSA encryption). If you're passing plaintext directly to modexp to implement RSA encryption, you're boned no matter what public exponent you use.

[@mattkeenan](https://github.com/mattkeenan) --- that is a corollary only if you are using RSA unsafely to begin with. In a competent RSA design, you'd never be passing deterministic plaintext directly to RSA; every message would be different by dint of padding. You must not ever use RSA without a secure padding scheme. RSA padding is not like block cipher padding; it's not a nicety, but instead absolutely required for the security of the system.

The cube root attack is another that only works if you're using unpadded RSA, which is unsafe with any public modulus.

Yeah. This stuff changes fast - I remember an older copy of applied crypto used to recommend e=3, and then the text that I was using for crypto course explained what's wrong with e=3.

Really should find the time to brush up on this stuff...

Furgusen and Schneier, Cryptography Engineering, s 12.4.2, *recommends* e=3 RSA. But, don't use e=3, even though you can if you're careful.

In response to this issue, [@thatch45](https://github.com/thatch45) has opened an issue to further improve salt's security model in the 0.17 release due mid-July:

[#5913](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/5913)

"A few things to bring up here. First off, cryptography alone is not considered sufficient security, it is unwise to, for instance, expose ssh on the internet. Salt is a command and control system, it is unwise to expose ANY such system to the internet without aggressive firewall rules (any config management system, a system that contains code that manages a config management system or a system that contains keys allowing access to command and control systems)."

@kseifriedredhat Sounds like these are the approaches [@thatch45](https://github.com/thatch45) is considering in the next release ( 0.17, due mid-July 2013 ) to enhance the system security:

"The main goals in my mind with the present crypto in Salt are these:

1. Change to use a lib where someone else maintains the crypto backend (libssh, paramiko, nacl, keyczar, libzmqCurve(very new, needs investigation), (pycrypto does a much better job of this now then when I first wrote Salt and we may be able to just lean entirely on pycrypto)). The question of us keeping up with the changes in the crypto world is of the greatest concern.
2. Get rid of M2Crypto - this is unmaintained and not python3 compatible
3. Keep the ssh like approach to keys (WAY easier to manage and less prone to user error - perhaps the most common cause for security breaches)
4. Enable a pure ssh agent based system for Salt that does not require installing minions or masters at all (in the works - as in it kind of works in git right now - but can't use the awesome ZeroMQ power that makes Salt so amazing - read: slow, no peer system, no syndic, no mine etc.)"

Quoted from Saltstack Github Issue: [#5913](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/5913)

Could 1. be "switch to OpenSSL-provided TLS"? TLS key handling can function like SSH's with a little massaging, so it's not fundamentally a worse user experience.

TLS ought to be avoided for it's inherent complexity and unresolved issues / limited (secure) crypto configuration.

aside from an ssh-based tunnel, the proper solution here is to see through enhancements to libzmq or outsourcing salt's crypto to a more common library like NaCl/pycrypto/etc/

Those `os.umask` calls look odd. Are there multiple threads when this code runs?

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-07-01 17:04:15 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  Description  Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Salt, which can be exploited by malicious users to  compromise a vulnerable system and by malicious people to conduct brute force attacks and bypass  certain security restrictions.  1) Certain input related to the ID of a connecting minion is not properly verified before being  used to write files. This can be exploited to write files in arbitrary locations and e.g. bypass  the manual validation of new unknown minions.  2) An error when generating RSA keys within the "gen_keys()" function in salt/crypt.py can be  exploited to derive the private key and e.g. impersonate Salt masters or minions or disclose  communications contents.  The vulnerabilities #1 and #2 are reported in versions prior to 0.15.1.  3) Certain input related to the "ext_pillar" option is not properly sanitised before being used to  execute commands. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.  This vulnerability is reported in versions 0.14.0 through 0.15.0.   Solution: Update to version 0.15.1.  Provided and/or discovered by: The vendor credits Ronald Volgers.  Original Advisory: <http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/releases/0.15.1.html>   @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please say explicitly if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Patrick McLean   gentoo-dev  2013-07-01 18:26:00 UTC  ``` Version 0.15.1 was added to the tree on May 11th.  No need to stabilize as there are no stable versions of salt in the tree as of yet. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-07-02 20:38:21 UTC  ``` 0.14.1 needs to be removed, I believe. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Patrick McLean   gentoo-dev  2013-07-02 23:35:03 UTC  ``` Ok, all versions lower that 0.15.3 have been removed from the tree. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-07-03 00:03:15 UTC  ``` All done, then. ``` |  |

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!
