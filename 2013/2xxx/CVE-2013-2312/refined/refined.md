Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied parameters within the EC-CUBE shopping cart functionality. Specifically, the application was using `$_REQUEST` to retrieve form parameters, which includes GET and POST data. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious scripts via URL parameters, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. By crafting a malicious URL with injected JavaScript code, an attacker could execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser when they accessed the shopping cart page.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The use of `$_REQUEST` instead of `$_POST`  allows an attacker to manipulate parameters via the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could result in:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript code in parameters related to the shopping cart.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to access this malicious URL while having items in their shopping cart. This could be achieved through social engineering (e.g., phishing) where the victim is tricked into clicking the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, as it occurs within the context of a user accessing the cart page.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to convince a victim to click on a malicious link for the XSS attack to succeed.

**Additional Details (From Patches):**

*   The fix involved changing the way parameters are retrieved in the `LC_Page_Cart.php` file. The code was changed to use `$_POST` instead of `$_REQUEST` for retrieving form parameters, which prevents injection through the URL.
*  Input validation was added
*  An "EXIST_CHECK" was removed from the "quantity" parameter.
