I was going to request CVEs for these today. No idea why WordPress guys aren't
doing this, but they probably think it will take too much time and in some days
it might. There is a lot of plugins and also lots of vulnerabilities in them.

Should CVE-2013-2009 be used also for w3-total-cache issue?

Subject: WP-Super-Cache XSS and Remote Code Exec

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Is there any way to get the WordPress community involved in actually
handling security issues properly? E.g. requesting CVE's, or heck,
I'll settle for being notified via email directly. I found out about
this stuff on Reddit (linked to Tony Perez's blog posting) so I read
the code and voila:

===============================================================

WP-Super-Cache XSS 1.3
Fixed in 1.3.1 with code changes like:
- -<form name="wp_manager" action="<?php echo $_SERVER[ "REQUEST_URI" ];
?>" method="post">
+<form name="wp_manager" action="" method="post">

Please use CVE-2013-2008 for this issue.

===============================================================

WP-Super-Cache 1.2 Remote Code Execution
Fixed in 1.3:
+2013-04-11 10:39  donncha
+
+       * wp-cache.php: Remove mfunc, mclude and dynamic-cached-content
+         tags from comments. Props Frank Goossen
+
(<http://blog.futtta.be/2013/04/10/wp-safer-cache-stopgap-for-wordpress-cache-plugins-vulnerability/>)
+         and kisscsaby
+         (<http://wordpress.org/support/topic/pwn3d?replies=6>)

<http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/04/update-wp-super-cache-and-w3tc-immediately-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-disclosed.html>

To test leave a comment like: <!?mfunc echo PHP_VERSION; ?><!?/mfunc?>

To fix it they added a mfunc filter in wp-super-cache-1.3/wp-cache.php:

+add_filter( 'preprocess_comment','no_mfunc_in_comments' );
+add_filter( 'comment_text','no_mfunc_in_comments' );
+add_filter( 'comment_excerpt','no_mfunc_in_comments' );
+add_filter( 'comment_text_rss','no_mfunc_in_comments' );

Please use CVE-2013-2009 for this issue.
