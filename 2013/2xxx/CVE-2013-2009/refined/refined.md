Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-2009:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the WordPress WP-Super-Cache plugin failing to sanitize specific tags (`mfunc`, `mclude`, and `dynamic-cached-content`) within user-submitted comments. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code through specially crafted comments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary PHP code by injecting malicious code within comments.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site. This can lead to complete compromise of the website, including:
    - Data theft and modification
    - Website defacement
    - Installation of backdoors
    - Further attacks on other systems connected to the server

**Attack vectors:**

- **Comment Injection:** An attacker can inject the malicious code by leaving a comment on a vulnerable WordPress site.
- The specific code used was of the format `<!?mfunc echo PHP_VERSION; ?><!?/mfunc?>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to submit comments on the target WordPress site. This can be done even without user authentication.
- No special access rights are required beyond the ability to leave a comment on the WordPress blog.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in WP-Super-Cache versions prior to 1.3. Version 1.3 addresses it by filtering the comment input, removing the potentially malicious tags.
- The email thread also discusses a related XSS issue (CVE-2013-2008) in the same plugin and the lack of a standard process from WordPress for handling security vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability also affected the w3-total-cache plugin, although the discussion does not directly assign CVE-2013-2009 to it.
