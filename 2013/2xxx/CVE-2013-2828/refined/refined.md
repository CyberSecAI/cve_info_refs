- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the OSIsoft PI Interface for DNP3. Specifically, the DNP3 master driver does not properly validate input from DNP3 response messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The software fails to validate the structure/content of DNP3 messages, leading to a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The PI Interface for DNP3 shuts down unexpectedly and requires a manual restart to recover.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **IP-based**:  Attackers can send a specially crafted TCP packet over an IP network to the affected interface.
    - **Serial-based**: Attackers can send a specially crafted DNP3 response message to the affected interface through a serial connection. This requires physical access to the outstation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **IP-based**: Remote attacker with moderate skill to craft the malicious TCP packet.
    - **Serial-based**: Local access is required to the serial outstation. High skill needed due to physical access requirement, potentially involving social engineering.
