Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a static, hardcoded `secret_token.rb` value within the CloudForms Management Engine (CFME). This secret is used by Ruby on Rails to generate HMAC for verifying the integrity of signed cookies, which are used for session management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Static Secret:** The primary weakness is that the secret used for session cookie integrity is not unique to each deployment but rather a static value present across all deployments of CFME.
*   **Session Tampering:** This static secret enables session tampering, as an attacker who knows the secret can forge valid session cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform session hijacking. They can forge valid cookies, impersonating legitimate users and gain access to the application.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of user sessions, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data and actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** This is a remote attack vector, meaning the attacker doesn't require local access to the server.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attack involves manipulating session cookies by creating or modifying them using the known static secret.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Static Secret:** The attacker must be able to obtain the static secret used by CFME. This could involve decompiling the application or accessing the source code.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests with manipulated session cookies to the CFME server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ramon de C Valle of the Red Hat Product Security Team.
*   The issue is resolved in CloudForms 3.0. Users of CloudForms 2.0 are advised to upgrade.
*   The vulnerability is related to how Ruby on Rails uses HMAC for cookie integrity, specifically the use of a server-side secret.
