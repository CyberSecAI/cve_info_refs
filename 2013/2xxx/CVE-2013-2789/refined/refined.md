- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the Kepware Technologiesâ€™ DNP Master Driver for the KEPServerEX Communications Platform when handling input on Port 20000/TCP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not validate input on port 20000/TCP, which allows for an infinite loop to occur.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack exploiting this vulnerability could cause a denial-of-service condition by putting the master station into an infinite loop. The master station requires a manual restart to recover.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted TCP packet or through serial communications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with moderate skill can exploit the vulnerability remotely. No public exploits are known to target this vulnerability.
