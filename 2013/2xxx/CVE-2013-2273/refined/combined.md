## CVE-2010-5137

```
Date: 2010-07-28
Summary: OP_LSHIFT crash
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| Affected | | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.4 | 0.3.5 |

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.4 | 0.3.5 |

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One exploited a bug in the transaction handling code and allowed an attacker to spend coins that they did not own. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

```

## CVE-2010-5140

Summary: Never confirming transactions
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| Affected | | Fix |

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.12 | 0.3.13 |

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.

Not fixed, so I'd better alert people before they can be tracked...The attack requires you to connect and be disconnected from the same node almost 11 times. Nodes do ban DoS offenders for some time, so the attack can take some days mounted from a single IP. Nevertheless, if you can control 11 different IPs (very easy), and you can re-connect to the peer, you cant still mount a successful attack in a few minutes.The attack allows only to know the Bitcoin public address related to an IP. If a peer is using Tor, then there is no loss of anonymity.Affected Systems-----------------The problem affects all versions of the Satoshi Bitcoin Client.Summary---------The method CTxMemPool::accept() has a protection against 'penny-flooding'. The protection prevents a transaction with very low fees and big size to be forwarded or even stored in the memory pool.The problem is that this protection tests if a transaction is from a wallet owned by the user, and if it's the case, then the protection is skipped. This fact can be used by the attacker as an oracle.There are currently around 1M addresses with non-zero balance (an estimation based on <http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3524/how-many-unspent-transaction-outputs-are-there>).An attacker can discover which of the addresses are owned by a peer by the following procedure:1. For each address, the attacker choose one unspent output Out(i)2. Group the 1M unspent outputs in 1632 transactions Tx(j), each one containing 613 previns. Each transaction would be approximately 26999 Kbytes long. Add one output. Put zero fees. (GetMinFee() will return zero)3. Send each Tx(j) one by one to the victim node.4. After sending each transaction, the victim node may:- Reject the transaction because it penny-floods (normally). In this case you will be still able to send more transactions.- Disconnect you (DoS detection) you since you are not providing the correct signature scripts (this is the case when you have hit an owned address)5. If you have been disconnected, repeat recursively a binary search grouping the prevouts of this transaction until you find a single one that disconnects you. Note that you may need to add additional dummy previns or prevouts to the transaction if it becomes too small to be blocked by the peer with the penny-flooding protection system.With a 54 Kb/sec link, sending each Tx takes 1/2 sec so finding the first tx takes in the worst case, 13 minutes. Afterwards each binary search step takes 1/2 seconds in the worst case, so with 10 additional tests you can find an prevout with the desired property in 2^10 prevouts, more than the 613 originally contained, in a few seconds.I haven´t tested the attack but, check for yourself. The explanation is clear enough. But without testing the attack, I can be mistaken.You can protect very easily from the attack by rising the "-limitfreerelay" value to something like 1000000. Of course, that will also disable the penny-flooding protection.Until the next vuln report,  Yours sincerely,  Sergio. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Just send each Out(i) in a single Tx(j).Sergio. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Sergio's method can be used to fine a list of ip's like this to find the true sender, even if it wasn't the first to relay it. If the node does not have a direct connection at all it still won't work though.

I may have a go implementing this to improve blockchain.info's relayed by accuracy.Doesn't that sort of strip a lot of privacy away from a lot of bitcoin users, without their consent? | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   Jeff Garzik, Bloq CEO, former bitcoin core dev team; opinions are my own.Visit bloq.com / metronome.ioDonations / tip jar: 1BrufViLKnSWtuWGkryPsKsxonV2NQ7Tcj | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

You could even run them both on the same machine (you'll use double the CPU and disk space, unfortunately).Similarly, using the Armory client mitigates this issue.While this is certainly not a critical vulnerability, it is very important in terms of privacy.  Excellent find Sergio.The root-cause of this information leak is that large transactions with insufficient fees are not forwarded or stored unless that transaction involves addresses owned by the user.  Perhaps this should be an option and the default should simply be not to forward?The vast majority of clients will most likely keep the default which makes this essentially equivalent to enforcing transaction fees.  However, this may be a good enough reason to do so. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

You could even run them both on the same machine (you'll use double the CPU and disk space, unfortunately).If you run (or know) a full node that you trust 100%, there's no need to replicate the block chain - the biggest amount of data you might need is a listing of all unspent outputs, the minimum amount would be probably the unspent outputs of your own addresses (doable now with bloom filters in 0.8 as far as I understood)I think the main issue with this attack is still that Bitcoin (the "finance application") and bitcoind (the "full network node") started and still are closely interlinked. I guess in the longer run something like the approach by the armory client will emerge, where the node does not know and care anything about a wallet and the finance application won't know anything about the block chain but has to trust a node (most likely on the same PC/installation). | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   **[https://www.coinlend.org](https://www.coinlend.org/?referral=2P32I7)** <-- automated lending at various exchanges.**[https://www.bitfinex.com](https://bitfinex.com/?refcode=P-feBqRH)** <-- Trade BTC for other currencies and vice versa. | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-03-17 14:13:10 UTC  ``` CVE-2013-2273 <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2273> :  bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.4.9rc1, 0.5.x before 0.5.8rc1, 0.6.0 before 0.6.0.11rc1, 0.6.1 through 0.6.5 before 0.6.5rc1, and 0.7.x before 0.7.3rc1 make it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information about returned change by leveraging certain predictability in the outputs of a Bitcoin transaction.   CVE-2013-2292 <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2292> :  bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (electricity consumption) by mining a block to create a nonstandard Bitcoin transaction containing multiple OP_CHECKSIG script opcodes.   CVE-2013-2293 <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2293> :  The CTransaction::FetchInputs method in bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.8.0rc1 copies transactions from disk to memory without incrementally checking for spent prevouts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disk I/O consumption) via a Bitcoin transaction with many inputs corresponding to many different parts of the stored block chain. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Luke-Jr    2013-03-17 15:39:37 UTC  ``` CVE-2013-2292 should get another bug, as it is still unresolved. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2013-03-19 20:26:55 UTC  ``` CVE-2013-2293 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-2293>):   The CTransaction::FetchInputs method in bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before   0.8.0rc1 copies transactions from disk to memory without incrementally   checking for spent prevouts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial   of service (disk I/O consumption) via a Bitcoin transaction with many inputs   corresponding to many different parts of the stored block chain.  CVE-2013-2292 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-2292>):   bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a   denial of service (electricity consumption) by mining a block to create a   nonstandard Bitcoin transaction containing multiple OP_CHECKSIG script   opcodes.  CVE-2013-2273 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-2273>):   bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.4.9rc1, 0.5.x before 0.5.8rc1, 0.6.0 before   0.6.0.11rc1, 0.6.1 through 0.6.5 before 0.6.5rc1, and 0.7.x before 0.7.3rc1   make it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive   information about returned change by leveraging certain predictability in   the outputs of a Bitcoin transaction.  CVE-2013-2272 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-2272>):   The penny-flooding protection mechanism in the CTxMemPool::accept method in   bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.4.9rc1, 0.5.x before 0.5.8rc1, 0.6.0 before   0.6.0.11rc1, 0.6.1 through 0.6.5 before 0.6.5rc1, and 0.7.x before 0.7.3rc1   allows remote attackers to determine associations between wallet addresses   and IP addresses via a series of large Bitcoin transactions with   insufficient fees. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2013-03-19 21:46:19 UTC  ``` Luke can you identify which ones we should keep on the tree and which ones we should drop? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2013-03-27 23:57:59 UTC  ``` net-p2p/bitcoind, net-p2p/bitcoin-qt 0.8.1 are now in the tree. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Luke-Jr    2013-03-28 00:44:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=462046#c4)) > net-p2p/bitcoind, net-p2p/bitcoin-qt 0.8.1 are now in the tree.  Note that 0.8.1 did not fix any of the vulnerabilities in this bug... ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2013-03-28 00:46:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=462046#c5)) > (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=462046#c4)) > > net-p2p/bitcoind, net-p2p/bitcoin-qt 0.8.1 are now in the tree. >  > Note that 0.8.1 did not fix any of the vulnerabilities in this bug...  Thanks wasn't certain, hence [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=462046#c3) ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-08-30 00:52:03 UTC  ``` @maintainers: ping, does 0.8.3 fix these issues? ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Luke-Jr    2013-08-30 01:17:19 UTC  ``` <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CVEs> ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Luke-Jr    2015-02-23 23:04:05 UTC  ``` This should be closed. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2015-02-23 23:09:20 UTC  ``` @security team.  go ahead and vote on glsa. we're done. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-03-18 07:37:59 UTC  ``` Vulnerable packages have been gone for over 2 years so no GLSA. ``` |  |
