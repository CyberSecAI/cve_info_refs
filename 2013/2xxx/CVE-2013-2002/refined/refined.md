Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2002:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an unvalidated length in the `_XtResourceConfigurationEH` function within the `libXt` library. This function processes the `RCM_DATA` property, which is expected to be in the format of `resource_length, resource, value`. The `resource_length` value is used to determine the length of the resource data. However, the function does not properly validate that this length is within the bounds of the property string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unvalidated Length:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation of the `resource_length`. A malicious or compromised server can provide an invalid `resource_length` that points outside of the property string.
- **Memory Corruption:** When an invalid `resource_length` is provided, it can lead to the function attempting to read or write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer or the property string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** Successful exploitation leads to memory corruption, where the application writes to arbitrary memory addresses due to the incorrect length.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption can cause application crashes, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, memory corruption vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution. This is a more severe outcome, though not explicitly confirmed in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious X Server:** A malicious or compromised X server is the primary attack vector. An attacker could modify the X server to send crafted responses with an invalid `resource_length` value.
- **Privilege Escalation:** As mentioned in the X.org advisory, a privileged X client (e.g., a setuid screen lock program) connected to an unprivileged, manipulated X server (e.g., Xvfb, Xephyr) is a scenario that can lead to privilege escalation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to control the X server or manipulate X server responses:** The attacker must be in a position to control or modify the behavior of the X server to send malicious responses to clients. This can involve running a malicious X server or altering a virtual X server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects `libXt` versions 1.1.3 and earlier.
- The fix involves adding proper validation to ensure that `resource_length` is within the bounds of the property string, preventing memory corruption.
- The vulnerability is part of a larger group of vulnerabilities discovered by Ilja van Sprundel related to how X client libraries handle responses from servers.

This vulnerability is part of a broader set of X11 vulnerabilities disclosed at the same time, as referenced in several of the included documents. It highlights the dangers of clients blindly trusting server responses, and the importance of validating lengths and bounds within network protocols.
