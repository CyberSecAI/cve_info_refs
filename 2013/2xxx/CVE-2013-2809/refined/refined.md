- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OSIsoft PI Interface for DNP3 does not properly validate input from DNP3 response messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation (CWE-20).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial-of-service (DoS) condition, resulting in an unexpected shutdown of the interface. The interface must be manually restarted to recover.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **IP-based**: A specially crafted TCP packet containing a malicious DNP3 response message sent over an IP network.
    - **Serial-based**: A specially crafted DNP3 response message sent via a serial connection. This requires physical access to the outstation or social engineering to accomplish.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **IP-based**: An attacker with moderate skill can craft the malicious TCP packet and remotely exploit the vulnerability.
    - **Serial-based**: An attacker with high skill requires physical access to the device or some amount of social engineering to exploit the vulnerability.
