## LeftHand, StoreVirtual remote reset suggests factory account

Technion, the blogger who recently turned up an undocumented back door in HP's StoreOnce, has turned up similar issues in other HP products - publicised on support forums by the company, but unnoticed at the time.

According to his trawling of various HP support forums, he has told *The Register* there appear to be company support backdoors in the company's StoreVirtual SAN products, based on the LeftHand operating system.

The hardware used to include a hard-reset button to set the factory defaults but this was removed as a security measure (that is, so insiders couldn't give themselves admin privileges to hardware they shouldn't access by resetting it). However, the solution seems to Technion no better: administrative password recovery is now carried out remotely by HP support.

That suggests the devices include an HP-accessible support account has been incorporated into the LeftHand 9.0 and higher code – and the accounts have existed since as far back as 2009.

As has been demonstrated many times over, any remotely-accessible login provides a potential attack vector, should the userid and password be discovered by attackers.

Both the support forum posts Technion identified (and contacted HP about) are unequivocal: lost admin passwords are resettable by HP. One, from November 2011, states: “You will need to call support and they can get into the backed and reset it for you. 1-800-633-3600 'Lefthand Solutions'”. The other, posted by a LeftHand product manager in 2009, states: “Call support. They can reset the password remotely.”

*The Register* contacted HP last week, and has today received this response: “HP takes seriously its responsibility of maintaining current security policies as a top priority for our customers. We are aware of a potential HP StoreVirtual security issue, and are actively working on a fix for our customers. Further information will be shared as soon as it is available.” ®
