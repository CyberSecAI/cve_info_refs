Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2013-2352:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of a remotely accessible support account embedded within HP's LeftHand operating system, used in StoreVirtual SAN products. This account allows HP support to remotely reset admin passwords.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Undocumented backdoor:** The existence of a support account with remote access capabilities is not properly documented or secured.
-   **Remote password reset:** The ability for HP support to remotely reset admin passwords introduces a potential attack vector.
-   **Hardcoded credentials/access:** While not explicitly stated, the implication is that HP support has a way to access the system, likely using some form of shared or default credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Unauthorized access:** An attacker who discovers the support account credentials or a way to exploit the remote password reset mechanism could gain unauthorized administrative access to the storage system.
-   **Data compromise:** With administrative access, an attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data stored on the device, disrupt operations, or cause a denial of service.
-   **System control:** Full administrative privileges could allow an attacker to completely control the storage system.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Credential theft:** If the credentials for the HP support account are discovered (e.g., through social engineering, leaked information, or a breach at HP), an attacker can use them to gain access to the storage system.
-   **Exploitation of password reset mechanism:** If the remote password reset mechanism is vulnerable (e.g., due to weak authentication, predictable reset tokens, etc.) an attacker may be able to manipulate it to gain access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Knowledge of backdoor/support account:** The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of the support account or the remote password reset feature.
-   **Access to network:** The attacker needs network access to the storage system to exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Credentials or exploit:** The attacker needs either the credentials for the support account or a method to exploit the password reset mechanism.
-   **Potentially, access to HP infrastructure:** If exploiting the remote reset mechanism, they may require some interaction with the HP support infrastructure.

**Additional Notes:**
- The article notes that the hard reset button was removed as a security measure, but the remote reset is considered just as bad by the author.
- The vulnerability affects LeftHand 9.0 and higher code, with the accounts potentially existing since 2009.
- HP has acknowledged the issue and is working on a fix.
