Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-2020:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An issue was found in ClamAV's handling of UPX-packed executables, specifically related to how it calculated and applied a "skew" during unpacking. A logic error led to incorrect offset calculations when unpacking UPX packed executables, resulting in a heap corruption vulnerability when scanning such files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap corruption: The incorrect offset calculation during UPX unpacking led to writing data to an incorrect memory location which could cause heap corruption.
- Logic error

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: An attacker could cause ClamAV to crash.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated in all sources, the heap corruption issue could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution under the right conditions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by scanning a specially crafted UPX-packed executable file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious UPX-packed executable to ClamAV for scanning. This can be achieved through various means such as submitting the file via a web service using ClamAV for scanning, or through a system using ClamAV as its antivirus scanner, and the file is then scanned by ClamAV.
