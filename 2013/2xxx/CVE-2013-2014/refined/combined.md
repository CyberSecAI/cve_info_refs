There is very little detail here. Can you provide some more information? Do you have something to reproduce the problem you see? Can you provide more information about what happens in the "crash" ?

We still need more precision. Are all types of requests affected ? Or only authenticated requests ? Any particular example we should use to reproduce and confirm the fix ? thanks in advance...

Adding PTL for confirmation and Dan Prince who works on a similar issue.

This isn't exactly the same with [https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1098307](https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/%2Bbug/1098307), before validate the Http POST data, all stores in the memory, concurrent requests with large post data can consume all the physcial server memory,result in process killed by the kernel.

simple way to test with cgroup.

1, mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/keystone,

echo 100M > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/keystone/memory.limit\_in\_bytes (max memory is 100M for the keystone process)

2, echo $$ /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/keystone/tasks && keystone-all

3 send http post request with data large than 100M

4, see dmesg info ,the keystone process is killed duo to out of memory

This has been fixed in the trunk by adding a sizelimit middleware, but not backpored to stable/folsom and I have submit a patch to stable/folsom <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22661/>

also, I think this affects quantum as well, but need testing, will update later.

Backporting the sizelimit middleware is not an option for a security patch on a stable release. We need to address that with a specific patch addressing the specific issue.

keystone-core: can you confirm that we're still vulnerable, based on comment 5 ?

dprince's patch should have addressed this in folsom for the public API. I'd acknowledge that the admin API remains vulnerable.

Backporting the middleware is inconsequential without corresponding changes to keystone.conf to deploy the new middleware; we could alternatively "overload" the xml\_body middleware (already deployed in every pipeline by default, and probably the first middleware to be affected by an oversized request) to also validate the size of the request in stable/folsom and stable/essex -- regardless of whether it's an XML request or not.

I kinda like the idea of overloading the xml\_body middleware, as it's a bit less intrusive than asking everyone to update their config files.

Maybe we should wrap up the sizelimit middleware for grizzly into that too, for consistency ?

@Dan, opinions ?

The issue we are talking about isn't necessarily XML only correct? The initial bug description seems to describe large requests in general as being a potential problem.

I'm also a bit confused here as to what exactly we are trying to solve. Isn't this the same issue we fixed in:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/19567/>

Like ttx points out we sort of decided not to backport that to Folsom since it fell under the "new feature" umbrella. That said there is nothing preventing a distro from picking up that patch for extra protection.

-----

Also the "keystone has no limitation for requests and headers size which may cause DB or process crash" description on this bug could be a bit misleading I think.

Eventlets WSGI defaults should cover us in terms of checking max header size. Eventlets wsgi.py shows:

MAX\_HEADER\_LINE = 8192

 MAX\_TOTAL\_HEADER\_SIZE = 65536

 url\_length\_limit=MAX\_REQUEST\_LINE (which is set to 8192 by default...)

----

My main question here is there some new ground/or request type that upstream grizzly isn't protected from? Or just something we need to backport to Folsom?

dan: I think this is just an issue of backporting; I believe grizzly is sufficiently protected.

As for xml\_body, I'm not suggesting that XML is somehow special here, just that it's the first place in the folsom pipeline that could be affected by an overly large request, and happens to (arguably) be a logical place to backport the functionality of RequestBodySizeLimiter without requiring pipeline changes.

dolph: I've got an idea. I think we might be able to inject the grizzly sizelimit middleware into the keystone pipeline without making config changes to the keystone.conf file. A bit hackish but if I can get it working (and you guys buy it) then I think we might have a path forward here.

I sort of feel like the cat is out of the bag on this issue (so why handle this privately) but whatever.

I'm fine with considering that this should be addressed by external protection layers in Essex/Folsom (either a backport of the sizelimit middleware or some early proxy) and be done with it. It's a bit unlikely that any serious setup wouldn't have some loadbalancing in place that would reject RAM-eating requests anyway... Not sure it's a lot worse than some hack to insert it in a stable branch update.

We could even ask the OSSG to do a security note about it if they feel it's worth it.

Russell, Mikal: your take ?

About WSGI default limits: I think Yaguang was mentioning POST requests, which are not covered by limits ? If they are, most of this bug is moot.

I suppose there's also the option of backporting the middleware and leaving it up to the deployment to enable it if they would like to. That could be done along with noting that we expect larger deployments are already protected by other means.

@ttx -- I think its reasonable to realize that we are occasionally going to encounter security problems where there isn't a good fix for stable options. We're offering users a few options here: upgrade; middleware; or some sort of protecting proxy. I think that's a perfectly reasonable response.

If backporting the middleware is not acceptable for stable, then I agree that we should just punt on this for stable as Thierry described in comment #15.

My favorite option now is to get the OSSG to issue a security note basically saying: "you should filter size as upstream as you can, there are smart LB/proxies, there is the sizelimit middleware in Grizzly (if you want it for Folsom you can find it here)."

Does it help if you manually modprobe dm-snapshot? What does "dmsetup targets" say?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

There is no reason keystone needs to accept really large HTTP requests. We should block them globally for security.

Branch: master

commit 7691276b869a86c2b75631d5bede9f61e030d9d8

Author: Dan Prince <email address hidden>

Date: Sat Jan 12 22:22:42 2013 -0500

Limit the size of HTTP requests.

Adds a new RequestBodySizeLimiter middleware to guard against

    really large HTTP requests. The default max request size is 112k

    although this limit is configurable via the 'max\_request\_body\_size'

    config parameter.

Fixes LP [Bug #1099025](/bugs/1099025).
