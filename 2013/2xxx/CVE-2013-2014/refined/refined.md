{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The keystone service does not limit the size of incoming HTTP requests, including POST bodies. This allows an attacker to send arbitrarily large requests, leading to excessive memory consumption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation and size limitation on HTTP request bodies.",
      "Vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks due to uncontrolled memory usage."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious actor can send large HTTP requests, causing the keystone process to consume excessive memory and potentially crash due to out-of-memory errors.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending large HTTP POST requests to the keystone API endpoints."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the keystone service, which is generally accessible over the network."
