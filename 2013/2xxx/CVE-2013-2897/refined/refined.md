{
  "CVE-2013-2897": {
    "vulnerability_details": "The HID multitouch driver in the Linux kernel does not properly validate report indexes, leading to a heap overwrite with a static value (0x2) or a NULL pointer dereference DoS. Specifically, the driver fails to validate that the report indexes are within the bounds of the allocated buffer when processing HID reports from a device, allowing an attacker to overwrite parts of the heap or cause a null pointer dereference by providing a crafted report with an out-of-bounds index.",
    "affected_component": "HID multitouch driver (drivers/hid/hid-multitouch.c)",
    "root_cause": "Improper validation of report indexes in the HID multitouch driver. The driver does not check if the report indexes are within the bounds of the allocated buffer before using them.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap overwrite",
      "NULL pointer dereference",
       "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (OOPS), potential for code execution via heap overwrite. A heap overwrite can be achieved which can lead to code execution. A NULL pointer dereference can cause system crash.",
      "attack_vector": "A physically proximate attacker can exploit the vulnerability by using a specially crafted USB HID device. This is due to the lack of validation when receiving HID reports from a device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be physically present and have the ability to connect a specially crafted USB HID device to the vulnerable system." ,
    "required_configuration": "CONFIG_HID_MULTITOUCH must be enabled."
