Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2013-2087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the web page. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The identified vulnerabilities are XSS vulnerabilities. The application failed to sanitize user-controlled data in the `movie title` field and in the error messages display.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page. If a user visits this page, the injected script could execute in their browser.
- This could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the web page.
    - Perform other actions within the context of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the manipulation of the movie title field. When a movie's title is saved, the unsanitized title is used in the success message, allowing for the XSS attack.
- Another attack vector exists in the error messages where unsanitized keys are output to the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to modify the movie title field, which could be achieved by having an account on the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the display of the error messages with the unsanitized key.
- The attacker needs to have the target user visit the affected page to trigger the malicious script.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves sanitizing the user-provided `movie title` using `html::purify()` function before displaying the success message.
- The fix also sanitizes the error message keys using the `html::purify()` function before display.
- The identified vulnerable software is Gallery version 3.0.6.
- The fixed version is 3.0.7.
- The multiple XSS vulnerabilities are treated as a single issue, indicated by the single CVE ID.
