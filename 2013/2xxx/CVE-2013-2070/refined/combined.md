Package        : nginx
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2070
Debian Bug     : 708164

A buffer overflow has been identified in nginx, a small, powerful,
scalable web/proxy server, when processing certain chunked transfer
encoding requests if proxy_pass to untrusted upstream HTTP servers is
used.  An attacker may use this flaw to perform denial of service
attacks, disclose worker process memory, or possibly execute arbitrary
code.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze), is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-2.2+wheezy1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: nginx security advisory (CVE-2013-2070)

Hello!

A security problem related to CVE-2013-2028 was identified,
affecting some previous nginx versions if proxy_pass to
untrusted upstream HTTP servers is used.

The problem may lead to a denial of service or a disclosure of a
worker process memory on a specially crafted response from an
upstream proxied server.

The problem affects nginx 1.1.4 - 1.2.8, 1.3.0 - 1.4.0.

The problem is already fixed in nginx 1.5.0, 1.4.1.  Version 1.2.9
was released to address the issue in the 1.2.x legacy branch.

Patch for nginx 1.3.9 - 1.4.0 is the same as for CVE-2013-2028:

<http://nginx.org/download/patch.2013.chunked.txt>

Patch for older nginx versions (1.1.4 - 1.2.8, 1.3.0 - 1.3.8)
can be found here:

<http://nginx.org/download/patch.2013.proxy.txt>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Isn't similar code in older version (say, 1.2.6) in
src/http/modules/ngx\_http\_proxy\_module.c?
```

I think this fix is not quite correct because it is not possible to
detect signed integer overflow in C after it has happened. (Curiously,
the original fix for CVE-2002-0392 had the same issue.)

Hello!

A security problem related to CVE-2013-2028 was identified,
affecting some previous nginx versions if proxy_pass to
untrusted upstream HTTP servers is used.

The problem may lead to a denial of service or a disclosure of a
worker process memory on a specially crafted response from an
upstream proxied server.

The problem affects nginx 1.1.4 - 1.2.8, 1.3.0 - 1.4.0.

The problem is already fixed in nginx 1.5.0, 1.4.1.  Version 1.2.9
was released to address the issue in the 1.2.x legacy branch.

Patch for nginx 1.3.9 - 1.4.0 is the same as for CVE-2013-2028:

<http://nginx.org/download/patch.2013.chunked.txt>

Patch for older nginx versions (1.1.4 - 1.2.8, 1.3.0 - 1.3.8)
can be found here:

# nginx: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **201310-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/nginx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.1-r2** |

### Background

nginx is a robust, small, and high performance HTTP and reverse proxy
server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in nginx. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request, possibly
resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process, or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a
context-dependent attacker may be able to obtain sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All nginx users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/nginx-1.4.1-r2"

```
