Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-2070:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in nginx when processing chunked transfer encoding requests. This occurs when the `proxy_pass` directive is used to forward requests to untrusted upstream HTTP servers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is specifically a buffer overflow, meaning data can be written beyond the allocated memory space. This is triggered by a specially crafted response from an upstream server when chunked encoding is in use.
- **Improper Input Validation:** It appears that the size and length of the chunked data were not properly checked or validated before being used, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by crashing the nginx worker process.
- **Memory Disclosure:** The vulnerability could allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the worker process's memory.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** In some scenarios, it may be possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is the most severe impact but is not guaranteed in every instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a crafted HTTP request.
- **Upstream Server:** The attack relies on the response received from an upstream server. This means that if nginx is proxying requests to a server controlled by an attacker, they can send a malicious response to trigger this issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Untrusted Upstream Server Control:** The attacker needs to control or have access to an HTTP server that is being proxied by the vulnerable nginx instance (via `proxy_pass`).
- **Crafted HTTP Response:** The attacker must be capable of crafting a specific malicious chunked-transfer encoded response.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the capability to send network traffic to the nginx server via the upstream server.

**Affected Versions:**
- nginx versions 1.1.4 through 1.2.8, and 1.3.0 through 1.4.0.

**Fix:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in nginx versions 1.5.0, 1.4.1, and 1.2.9.
- Patches are also available for older versions, specifically:
    - `patch.2013.chunked.txt` for nginx 1.3.9 - 1.4.0
    - `patch.2013.proxy.txt` for older versions 1.1.4 - 1.2.8, 1.3.0 - 1.3.8

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is related to CVE-2013-2028, which involved similar issues with chunked responses, and the fix for that issue did not fully address this case of chunked transfer-encoding responses.
- It's important to note that the vulnerability is only exploitable when nginx is configured as a reverse proxy using `proxy_pass` to forward requests to potentially malicious or compromised HTTP servers.
