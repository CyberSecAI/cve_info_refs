The provided content is related to CVE-2013-10004.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The SAMwin server software uses a weak password hashing algorithm that is prone to collisions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `passwordScramble()` function used by SAMwinLIBVB.dll computes password hashes using a simple algorithm: summing the product of each character's ASCII value and its index in the password string after converting the password to uppercase.
- This algorithm has a small output space (between 1188 and 6930 for common password lengths) and produces a non-uniform distribution of hash values.
- Many different passwords can produce the same hash value (collisions).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to the SAMwin server's administrative console.
- This allows them to reroute calls, change mailbox settings, and perform other manipulations of the SAMwin server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Brute-force attack on the web application login of the SAMwin Manager.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web application login of the SAMwin Manager.
- They need to be able to make multiple login attempts.
- The attacker can construct a list of password candidates, one for every possible hash value, and guess these in order of descending probability, greatly increasing the likelihood of successful login when compared to a completely random password attempt.
