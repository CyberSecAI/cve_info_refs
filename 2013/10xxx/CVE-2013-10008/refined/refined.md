The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, which includes changes to various files within an eShop project. The commit message indicates "some sql injection vulnerabilities fixes" and "new sql injection safe methods in mysql wrapper".

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit aims to address SQL injection vulnerabilities. The commit message explicitly states "some sql injection vulnerabilities fixes" suggesting that the code had insecure SQL query construction.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The commit message and file changes to `MySQLdbManager.java` confirm that SQL injection vulnerabilities were present prior to this commit. The specific vulnerable code is not shown in the diff, as the changes are to the metadata of the project and the `MySQLdbManager.java` is only shown as modified, without showing the actual change.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of SQL injection vulnerabilities is that an attacker could potentially:
*   Read sensitive data from the database
*   Modify data in the database
*   Execute arbitrary SQL queries, possibly leading to privilege escalation or denial of service
*   Bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector would involve injecting malicious SQL code through user inputs that are not properly sanitized when constructing SQL queries. This would most likely occur in parts of the application that interact with the database and accept user input, such as login forms, search bars, or other data entry points.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to interact with the application and provide input that reaches the vulnerable parts of the application which interacts with the database. This would usually mean the attacker has network access to the application. No privileged access is needed as the vulnerability would be exploited through normal interaction with the application.

**Additional details:**
The commit message also indicates that new "sql injection safe methods" were added to the "mysql wrapper". This implies that the fix involves implementing parameterized queries or using prepared statements within the `MySQLdbManager` class which now uses safer practices to prevent SQL injection by escaping user provided input.

It is important to note that this commit is from 2013, which might be of use when comparing it with other SQL injection vulnerabilities from the same time frame.
