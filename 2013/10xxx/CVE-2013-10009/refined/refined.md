The provided content relates to CVE-2013-10009.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the usage of string formatting to build SQL queries, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability. The code directly uses string formatting with user-controlled inputs (name and item) to construct SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data leakage, data modification, or even complete database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could provide specially crafted input strings as `name` or `item` parameters to the vulnerable functions `aendern` and `lesen`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to control the input parameters `name` and `item` of the vulnerable functions.
The attacker needs to interact with the vulnerable application and trigger these functions in order to exploit it.

**Additional details:**

The provided commit `9d8adbc` shows the fix for the SQL injection vulnerability by replacing string formatting with parameterized queries.
Specifically, the vulnerable lines:
```python
keks = self.DBcursor.execute(u"SELECT nickname, count from kekse WHERE nickname like '%s' AND item =='%s' LIMIT 1" % (name, item)).fetchall()
keks = self.DBcursor.execute(u"SELECT `nickname`, `count` from kekse WHERE item=='%s' AND `count`>=1 ORDER BY `count` DESC LIMIT 10" % (name)).fetchall()
```
were changed to
```python
keks = self.DBcursor.execute(u"SELECT nickname, count from kekse WHERE nickname like ? AND item ==? LIMIT 1", (name, item)).fetchall()
keks = self.DBcursor.execute(u"SELECT `nickname`, `count` from kekse WHERE item==? AND `count`>=1 ORDER BY `count` DESC LIMIT 10", (name)).fetchall()
```
This change replaces the string formatting with parameterized queries, which prevents SQL injection attacks.
