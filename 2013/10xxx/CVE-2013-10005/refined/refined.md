Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-10005

**Root Cause:** The `RemoteAddr` and `LocalAddr` methods of the `proxiedConn` struct in the `go-socks` library could recursively call themselves if `c.boundAddr` or `c.remoteAddr` were nil.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Infinite recursion within the `LocalAddr` and `RemoteAddr` methods
- Lack of proper handling for nil `c.boundAddr` and `c.remoteAddr` values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Program crash due to stack overflow.
- Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting the call stack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: An attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely by interacting with a service that uses the vulnerable `go-socks` library

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with a service that uses the vulnerable `go-socks` library.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The `proxiedConn` struct's `LocalAddr` and `RemoteAddr` methods were implemented to return the bound address or remote address of the underlying connection.
- The methods had a flaw where, if the addresses were nil, they would call themselves rather than the underlying connection's methods, resulting in the infinite recursion.
- The fix (commit `233bccbb1ab`) involves changing these methods to directly return the result of `c.conn.LocalAddr()` and `c.conn.RemoteAddr()` respectively when the cached addresses (`c.boundAddr` and `c.remoteAddr`) are nil.

**Affected component:**
- The vulnerability is within the `github.com/btcsuite/go-socks` and `github.com/btcsuitereleases/go-socks` libraries, specifically before commit `233bccbb1abe02f05750f7ace66f5bffdb13defc`.
