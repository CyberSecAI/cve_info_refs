The provided content is a commit diff for the wordpress-exit-box-lite plugin, which includes security fixes. It addresses:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Direct access to the plugin file, potentially exposing the full path of the plugin.
- Lack of sanitization on user-supplied input that gets echoed back, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Unprivileged users being able to manipulate some plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** The original plugin could reveal its full path if accessed directly.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin was vulnerable to XSS through unsanitized user input in the admin settings.
- **Unprivileged Manipulation:** Unprivileged users could potentially modify settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** Disclosure of server paths could aid attackers in further reconnaissance.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks.
- **Unprivileged Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially change the settings of the plugin without proper authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access to the plugin file via HTTP request to trigger path disclosure.
- Manipulating the plugin settings page with malicious JavaScript code.
- Accessing admin functions without proper privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Direct access to the plugin file.
- Ability to access the WordPress admin panel and modify plugin settings.
- Ability to manipulate POST data when saving plugin settings.

**Fixes implemented in the commit:**
- Check if `add_action` exists to prevent direct execution of the plugin and avoid full path disclosure.
- Added nonce verification `check_admin_referer` to prevent CSRF attacks.
- Sanitization of the post values and width values.
- The commit also mentions added security checks to avoid full path disclosure, XSS, and unprivileged manipulation.
