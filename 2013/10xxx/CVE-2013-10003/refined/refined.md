- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SAMwin Agent uses hard-coded database credentials to connect to the SQL database server during startup, before any user authentication. Additionally, the application does not sanitize user input, allowing for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Hard-coded database credentials.
    - Lack of input sanitization.
    - SQL injection vulnerability.
    - Lack of middleware to verify communication.
    - Direct database access from client software.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Full control over the SAMwin software, including call handling.
    - Potential access to the database server's operating system, allowing for arbitrary file system access.
    - Modification of database content.
    - Compromise of the call center, its calls, and potentially data of other systems.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Direct connection to the database using the hard-coded credentials.
    - SQL injection through the username field of the login mask.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Access to the SAMwin Agent software to extract the hard-coded database credentials.
    - Network access to the SAMwin database server.
    - Ability to manipulate the SAMwin Agent login form.
