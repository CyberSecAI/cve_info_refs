- Arbitrary SQL Execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the date parameters. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulated HTTP requests: An attacker could modify the date parameters in the HTTP request to inject malicious SQL code
