- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The HTC email client fails to verify the server's SSL/TLS certificate when connecting to email servers using encrypted protocols (POP3 or IMAP). It automatically accepts any certificate without warning the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper SSL/TLS certificate verification. The email client does not check if the server certificate is valid, signed by a trusted CA, or matches the expected hostname.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and intercept a user's email credentials (username and password) and email content.
- **Attack vectors:** Rogue access point scenarios. An attacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi access point, intercepts the device's connection, and impersonates the user's email server using a malicious SSL certificate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the user's device and the email server, for example, by controlling the Wi-Fi network the user is connected to.
