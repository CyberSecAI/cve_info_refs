The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, which addresses potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code was directly using user-supplied input (from HTTP GET/POST parameters) in SQL queries without proper sanitization or type casting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection: The code was vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.  Specifically, the code was taking values from HTTP GET parameters (galaxy, system, planet, type, jmpto) and using them directly in SQL queries, without any validation or sanitization. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating these parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete data, or potentially take control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET/POST parameters. An attacker could craft malicious URLs with crafted values for parameters like "galaxy," "system," "planet," "type", or "jmpto". These parameters are used in SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and needs some knowledge of SQL syntax.
