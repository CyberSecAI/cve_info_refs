{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization when constructing SQL queries in the AbstractCatalog class.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating parameters in the OAI requests, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code that is then used by the application to query the database.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send OAI requests to the application with specifically crafted parameters."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The commit message and the `docs/version` file explicitly mention that the fix addresses an SQL injection vulnerability reported by Ward van Wanrooij. The vulnerability was fixed by adding a `AbstractCatalog.paramRegex` property to sanitize user inputs."
