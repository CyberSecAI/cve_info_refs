The provided content is related to CVE-2013-10018.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The commit message "fixed SQL injection, yet again" indicates that the root cause is the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `save_contact.php` file. The code was using user-supplied data directly in the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability. The vulnerable code uses string formatting (`sprintf`) to construct the SQL query, directly embedding the values from the `$_POST` array without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the POST parameters.
- This could lead to data breach (reading arbitrary database information), data modification (inserting, updating, or deleting data), denial of service (altering the database structure), or even gaining control over the server in some cases (through techniques such as stored procedures).

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests with malicious SQL code in the `nom`, `prenom`, `email`, `tel`, `mobile`, `client`, `fonction`, or `note` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `save_contact.php` script. No prior authentication or special privileges seem to be needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The commit diff shows the fix by utilizing `mysql_real_escape_string()` to sanitize the input before using it in the SQL query.
