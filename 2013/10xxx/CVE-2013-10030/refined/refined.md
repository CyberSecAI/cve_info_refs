Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security-related changes made in the commit `fad26701addb862c51baf85c6e3cc136aa79c309` for the `wordpress-exit-box-lite` plugin:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit message indicates the changes were made to address "full path disclosure, XSS, unprivileged manipulation". The diff shows that:
1.  A check was added to prevent direct execution of the plugin file, to avoid full path disclosure.
2.  An admin-referer check was added.
3.  A check of posted values for width was added.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The original plugin was vulnerable to full path disclosure if accessed directly, this was fixed by adding a check `if(!function_exists('add_action')){...die;}` which exits script execution and prevents path disclosure.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The changes suggest that there were XSS vulnerabilities which are being mitigated by changes in the admin input area.
*   **Unprivileged manipulation:** It is suggested that an attacker with no privileges could manipulate plugin settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** An attacker could gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, potentially aiding further attacks.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings and thus into admin pages, possibly leading to account compromise or other attacks on administrators.
*  **Unprivileged manipulation:** An attacker could modify plugin settings.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct File Access:**  An attacker could try to directly access the plugin file via a web browser, triggering the path disclosure.
*   **Malicious POST requests:** An attacker could forge POST requests to modify the plugin settings, potentially injecting malicious scripts or changing settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   For full path disclosure, no special privileges were required, an attacker just needs to know the URL of the plugin.
*   For XSS and unprivileged manipulation an attacker would need to find the admin page and manipulate POST request values, implying they could also possibly have admin access, depending on the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
*   The commit message provides a good summary of the changes made.
*   The code diff provides the specifics of the code changes.
*   The code change fixes multiple vulnerabilities.
