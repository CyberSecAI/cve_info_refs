- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SAMwin Agent uses hard-coded database credentials to connect to the SQL database server during startup. Additionally, the application does not sanitize user input in the login mask, allowing for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Hard-coded database credentials: The application uses the same database credentials across all installations.
    - SQL injection: Lack of input sanitization in the login mask allows for the execution of arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Full control over the SAMwin software, including call handling and routing.
    - Potential access to the database server's operating system, allowing for arbitrary file read, write, and execution (depending on database configuration).
    - Access to sensitive data within the database, including user accounts, call routing, and infrastructure details.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Direct database access using extracted hard-coded credentials.
    - Exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability through the username field in the login mask.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Access to the SAMwin Agent software to extract hard-coded credentials.
    - Network connectivity to the SQL database server.
    - Ability to input data into the login screen.
