The provided content relates to CVE-2013-10013.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the use of string concatenation to build SQL queries in the `DBAuthenticator.java` file, which is vulnerable to SQL injection. The original code constructed the SQL query by directly inserting the username and password values into the query string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `username` and `password` parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could bypass authentication by injecting malicious SQL code in the username or password fields. This could grant the attacker access to the application with elevated privileges.
- An attacker could potentially manipulate or steal data from the database, delete database records, or even gain access to the server via the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `username` and `password` input fields of the login form that calls the DBAuthenticator.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the login form to inject SQL code. No special network access is needed.
The attacker needs knowledge about the used database.

**Technical details:**

The vulnerability lies in the following code segment (before the fix):

```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM " + table + " WHERE "
        + columns.get("username") + "= ? AND "
        + columns.get("password") + "= '?'";
```
The password is treated as string and is enclosed in single quotes. The username is treated as parameter for Prepared Statement, but not the password.
This means, that an attacker can supply username via parameter, but still use SQL injection techniques on the password parameter.

The fix replaces the above code segment with:
```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM " + table + " WHERE "
        + columns.get("username") + "= ? AND "
        + columns.get("password") + "= ?";
```
And, this code utilizes prepared statements to avoid SQL injection:
```java
PreparedStatement prepStmt = t.getConnection().prepareStatement(query);
prepStmt.setString(1, args[0]);
prepStmt.setString(2, args[1]);
```
This change correctly uses prepared statements for both username and password, preventing SQL injection.
