Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability addressed in the commit:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The WP Print Friendly plugin prior to version 0.5.3 had a vulnerability that allowed unauthorized access to private and password-protected posts through the print page functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient access control:** The plugin did not properly check user permissions before allowing access to the print page, making private and password-protected posts accessible to unauthorized users via the print page.
*   **Lack of authorization:** The plugin failed to enforce the WordPress access control mechanisms when generating print views of content.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information disclosure:** Unauthorized users could view the content of private and password-protected posts, leading to the disclosure of confidential information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Directly accessing the print page URL of a private or password-protected post.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need to know or guess the URL to a print view of a private or password-protected post. No specific user privileges or prior authentication was needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by:
* Implementing an `is_protected()` method to check if the current user has the necessary capabilities to view the print page.
* Throwing a 404 error if the user does not have the necessary capabilities to view the print page.
* Removing print_url links from the content when the current user does not have the necessary capabilities to view the print page.
