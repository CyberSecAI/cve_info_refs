Security Update

* Correct security vulnerability allowing both private and password protected posts from being accessed through the print page
* Creates is\_protected() method to determine if the print page should be visible to the current user
* Remove print\_url links from the content when the current user does not have the necessary capabilities to view the print page

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I'm really not fond of the approach for a few reasons.  First off, there's no reason to throw a 404 for privately-published posts from within the plugin. WordPress does that already. It's better to not show the print template in that case, and that can be done within the `template_chooser()` method.  As for password-protected posts, we should prompt for the post password rather than assume that no one will ever have the password and want to print the post. |
