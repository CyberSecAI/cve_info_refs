The provided content is related to CVE-2013-10016.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The commit message indicates that the code fixes "another SQL injection" in `htdocs/admin/save_taxes.php`.
- The code change shows that the `$_GET['id']` parameter, used in a SQL DELETE query, is now being sanitized using `mysql_real_escape_string()`. Previously, it was vulnerable to SQL injection since it directly incorporated user input into a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability. User-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL, potentially leading to data modification or deletion, or other malicious actions within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `id` parameter within the URL targeting `htdocs/admin/save_taxes.php` when the `action` parameter is equal to "delete".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameter (`id`) in the URL.
