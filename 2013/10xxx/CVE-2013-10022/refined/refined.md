Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The commit message states "We fixed the bug related to XSS attack." This indicates the plugin was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- The code diff shows changes in `contact_form.php` where user inputs (`name`, `address`, `email`, `subject`, `message`, `phone`) from the contact form are now being sanitized using `htmlspecialchars()` before being processed or displayed.
- The original code directly used user supplied values from `$_POST` without proper sanitization, which allowed injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability was the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input from the contact form. Specifically:
   - The `$_POST` values for name, address, email, subject, message and phone were used without encoding, which allowed injecting arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in those fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **XSS attacks:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal user session cookies
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Deface the website
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Contact Form:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a contact form with malicious HTML or JavaScript code embedded within the input fields (name, address, email, subject, message, or phone).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to access the contact form on the website. This could be a public-facing contact form or a form on an authenticated section of a website.
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability, provided the contact form is publicly accessible.

**Summary of Changes:**

- The commit primarily focuses on sanitizing user input using `htmlspecialchars()` before processing or displaying them.
- Specifically, user inputs `name`, `address`, `email`, `subject`, `message` and `phone` are being sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
- The code also includes a combination of `strip_tags` and `preg_replace` to remove HTML tags.

This commit addresses the XSS vulnerability by sanitizing the user-supplied input.
