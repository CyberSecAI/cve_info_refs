{
  "CVE-2013-4950": {
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of user-provided input in file uploads and SQL queries.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient validation and sanitization of uploaded files.",
      "SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied data within SQL queries.",
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied data."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files (including executable code like PHP shells) to the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and the underlying system. Also, they can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration or modification, and perform XSS attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By submitting a crafted POST request to the vulnerable 'view.php' file with a file upload.",
       "By submitting crafted POST parameters to 'view.php' to inject SQL."
      , "By submitting crafted POST parameters to 'view.php' to inject XSS."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server and needs to identify forms that contain file upload functionality, and injectable parameters for SQLi and XSS. They would need to perform brute force on the form ID and potentially on the inserted record IDs for file uploads.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability exists in Machform Form Maker 2. The exploit details the process of finding a vulnerable form using brute-force, as well as the file upload path. The provided exploit code shows how to trigger the MySQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities. File uploads have a .tmp extension appended when form reviews are enabled."
