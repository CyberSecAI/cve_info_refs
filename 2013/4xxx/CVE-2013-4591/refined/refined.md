Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4591:

- **Vulnerability:** Missing check for buffer length in `__nfs4_get_acl_uncached` function within the Linux kernel's NFSv4 implementation.

- **Root Cause:** Commit `1f1ea6c` (included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as part of [CVE-2012-2375](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2375) fix) accidently dropped the checking for too small result buffer length.

- **Attack Vector:** A local, unprivileged user with access to an NFSv4 mount with ACL support could use `getxattr` on "system.nfs4\_acl". If the ACL has not been cached and the supplied buffer is too short, the complete ACL is still copied.

- **Impact:** Kernel and user space memory corruption, potentially leading to a system crash or privilege escalation.

- **Affected Versions:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

- **Fixed Versions:** This issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2013:1645, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only via RHSA-2014:0284

- **Upstream fix:** http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7d3e91a89b7adbc2831334def9e494dd9892f9af
