| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1031678#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-11-18 14:29:50 UTC  ``` Commit 1f1ea6c (included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as part of [CVE-2012-2375](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2375) fix) accidently dropped the checking for too small result buffer length.     If someone uses getxattr on "system.nfs4_acl" on an NFSv4 mount supporting ACLs, the ACL has not been cached and the buffer suplied is too short, we still copy the complete ACL, resulting in kernel and user space memory corruption.  Introduced by: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1f1ea6c2d9d8c0be9ec56454b05315273b5de8ce>  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7d3e91a89b7adbc2831334def9e494dd9892f9af>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1031678#c1)  Petr Matousek    2013-11-18 14:32:43 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1031678#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-21 20:36:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1645 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1645.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1031678#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-11 17:08:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2014:0284 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0284.html>   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0284)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-4387, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite

implementation handled sending of certain UDP packets over sockets that
used the UDP\_CORK option when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) feature
was enabled on the output device. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4470, Important)

* A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the apic\_get\_tmcct() function in KVM's

Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (LAPIC) implementation.
A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2013-6367, Important)

* A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the way KVM handled virtual

APIC accesses that crossed a page boundary. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-6368, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the qeth\_snmp\_command()

function in the Linux kernel's QETH network device driver implementation
handled SNMP IOCTL requests with an out-of-bounds length. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-6381, Important)

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-2375 released via RHSA-2012:1580

accidentally removed a check for small-sized result buffers. A local,
unprivileged user with access to an NFSv4 mount with ACL support could use
this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
the system. (CVE-2013-4591, Moderate)

* A format string flaw was found in the Linux kernel's block layer.

A privileged, local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their
privileges to kernel level (ring0). (CVE-2013-2851, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Hannes Frederic Sowa for reporting
CVE-2013-4470, Andrew Honig of Google for reporting CVE-2013-6367 and
CVE-2013-6368, and Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2013-2851.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

cifs: don't compare uniqueids in cifs\_prime\_dcache unless server inode numbers are in use
commit 2f2591a34db6c9361faa316c91a6e320cb4e6aee upstream.
Oliver reported that commit cd60042c caused his cifs mounts to
continually thrash through new inodes on readdir. His servers are not
sending inode numbers (or he's not using them), and the new test in
that function doesn't account for that sort of setup correctly.
If we're not using server inode numbers, then assume that the inode
attached to the dentry hasn't changed. Go ahead and update the
attributes in place, but keep the same inode number.

commit eb1b3fa5cdb9c27bdec8f262acf757a06588eb2d upstream.
The caller doesn't do anything with the dentry, so there's no point in
holding a reference to it on return. Also cifs\_prime\_dcache better
describes the actual purpose of the function.

linux/kernel.h: fix DIV\_ROUND\_CLOSEST with unsigned divisors
commit c4e18497d8fd92eef2c6e7eadcc1a107ccd115ea upstream.
Commit 263a523d18bc ("linux/kernel.h: Fix warning seen with W=1 due to
change in DIV\_ROUND\_CLOSEST") fixes a warning seen with W=1 due to
change in DIV\_ROUND\_CLOSEST.
Unfortunately, the C compiler converts divide operations with unsigned
divisors to unsigned, even if the dividend is signed and negative (for
example, -10 / 5U = 858993457). The C standard says "If one operand has
unsigned int type, the other operand is converted to unsigned int", so
the compiler is not to blame. As a result, DIV\_ROUND\_CLOSEST(0, 2U) and
similar operations now return bad values, since the automatic conversion
of expressions such as "0 - 2U/2" to unsigned was not taken into
account.
Fix by checking for the divisor variable type when deciding which
operation to perform. This fixes DIV\_ROUND\_CLOSEST(0, 2U), but still
returns bad values for negative dividends divided by unsigned divisors.
Mark the latter case as unsupported.
One observed effect of this problem is that the s2c\_hwmon driver reports
a value of 4198403 instead of 0 if the ADC reads 0.
Other impact is unpredictable. Problem is seen if the divisor is an
unsigned variable or constant and the dividend is less than (divisor/2).

mm: limit mmu\_gather batching to fix soft lockups on !CONFIG\_PREEMPT
commit 53a59fc67f97374758e63a9c785891ec62324c81 upstream.
Since commit e303297e6c3a ("mm: extended batches for generic
mmu\_gather") we are batching pages to be freed until either
tlb\_next\_batch cannot allocate a new batch or we are done.
This works just fine most of the time but we can get in troubles with
non-preemptible kernel (CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_NONE or CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_VOLUNTARY)
on large machines where too aggressive batching might lead to soft
lockups during process exit path (exit\_mmap) because there are no
scheduling points down the free\_pages\_and\_swap\_cache path and so the
freeing can take long enough to trigger the soft lockup.
The lockup is harmless except when the system is setup to panic on
softlockup which is not that unusual.
The simplest way to work around this issue is to limit the maximum
number of batches in a single mmu\_gather. 10k of collected pages should
be safe to prevent from soft lockups (we would have 2ms for one) even if
they are all freed without an explicit scheduling point.
This patch doesn't add any new explicit scheduling points because it
relies on zap\_pmd\_range during page tables zapping which calls
cond\_resched per PMD.
The following lockup has been reported for 3.0 kernel with a huge

drivers/rtc/rtc-vt8500.c: fix handling of data passed in struct rtc\_time
commit 2f90b68309683f2c5765a1b04ca23d71e51f1494 upstream.
tm\_mon is 0..11, whereas vt8500 expects 1..12 for the month field,
causing invalid date errors for January, and causing the day field to
roll over incorrectly.
The century flag is only handled in vt8500\_rtc\_read\_time, but not set in
vt8500\_rtc\_set\_time. This patch corrects the behaviour of the century
flag.

revert "rtc: recycle id when unloading a rtc driver"
commit 5abe257af8b95857b95fa0ba694530b446ae32d8 upstream.
Revert commit 2830a6d20139df2198d63235df7957712adb28e5.
We already perform the ida\_simple\_remove() in rtc\_device\_release(),
which is an appropriate place. Commit 2830a6d20 ("rtc: recycle id when
unloading a rtc driver") caused the kernel to emit
ida\_remove called for id=0 which is not allocated.
warnings when rtc\_device\_release() tries to release an alread-released
ID.
Let's restore things to their previous state and then work out why
Vincent's kernel wasn't calling rtc\_device\_release() - presumably a bug
in a specific sub-driver.

CRIS: fix I/O macros
commit c24bf9b4cc6a0f330ea355d73bfdf1dae7e63a05 upstream.
The inb/outb macros for CRIS are broken from a number of points of view,
missing () around parameters and they have an unprotected if statement
in them. This was breaking the compile of IPMI on CRIS and thus I was
being annoyed by build regressions, so I fixed them.
Plus I don't think they would have worked at all, since the data values
were missing "&" and the outsl had a "3" instead of a "4" for the size.
From what I can tell, this stuff is not used at all, so this can't be
any more broken than it was before, anyway.

proc: pid/status: show all supplementary groups
commit 8d238027b87e654be552eabdf492042a34c5c300 upstream.
We display a list of supplementary group for each process in
/proc//status. However, we show only the first 32 groups, not all of
them.
Although this is rare, but sometimes processes do have more than 32
supplementary groups, and this kernel limitation breaks user-space apps
that rely on the group list in /proc//status.
Number 32 comes from the internal NGROUPS\_SMALL macro which defines the
length for the internal kernel "small" groups buffer. There is no
apparent reason to limit to this value.
This patch removes the 32 groups printing limit.
The Linux kernel limits the amount of supplementary groups by NGROUPS\_MAX,
which is currently set to 65536. And this is the maximum count of groups
we may possibly print.

lib: atomic64: Initialize locks statically to fix early users
commit fcc16882ac4532aaa644bff444f0c5d6228ba71e upstream.
The atomic64 library uses a handful of static spin locks to implement
atomic 64-bit operations on architectures without support for atomic
64-bit instructions.
Unfortunately, the spinlocks are initialized in a pure initcall and that
is too late for the vfs namespace code which wants to use atomic64
operations before the initcall is run.
This became a problem as of commit 8823c079ba71: "vfs: Add setns support
for the mount namespace".
This leads to BUG messages such as:
BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#0, swapper/0/0

Fix this by initializing the spinlocks statically at compile time.

Commit 284f5f9 was intended to disable the "only\_one\_child()" optimization

DMI\_SYS\_VENDOR that contains "ftServer", when it should look for
DMI\_SYS\_VENDOR containing "Stratus" and DMI\_PRODUCT\_NAME containing
"ftServer".
Tested on Stratus ftServer 6400.

PCI/PM: Do not suspend port if any subordinate device needs PME polling
commit c733b77475707cc3980542c86ee0ad5c841d544c upstream.
Ulrich reported that his USB3 cardreader does not work reliably when
connected to the USB3 port. It turns out that USB3 controller failed to
awaken when plugging in the USB3 cardreader. Further experiments found
that the USB3 host controller can only be awakened via polling, not via PME
interrupt. But if the PCIe port to which the USB3 host controller is
connected is suspended, we cannot poll the controller because its config
space is not accessible when the PCIe port is in a low power state.
To solve the issue, the PCIe port will not be suspended if any subordinate
device needs PME polling.

PCI/PM: Keep runtime PM enabled for unbound PCI devices
commit 967577b062417b4e4b8e27b711220f4124f5153a upstream.
For unbound PCI devices, what we need is:
- Always in D0 state, because some devices do not work again after
being put into D3 by the PCI bus.
- In SUSPENDED state if allowed, so that the parent devices can still
be put into low power state.
To satisfy these requirements, the runtime PM for the unbound PCI
devices are disabled and set to SUSPENDED state. One issue of this
solution is that the PCI devices will be put into SUSPENDED state even
if the SUSPENDED state is forbidden via the sysfs interface
(.../power/control) of the device. This is not an issue for most
devices, because most PCI devices are not used at all if unbound.
But there are exceptions. For example, unbound VGA card can be used
for display, but suspending its parents makes it stop working.
To fix the issue, we keep the runtime PM enabled when the PCI devices
are unbound. But the runtime PM callbacks will do nothing if the PCI
devices are unbound. This way, we can put the PCI devices into
SUSPENDED state without putting the PCI devices into D3 state.

solos-pci: fix double-free of TX skb in DMA mode
commit cae49ede00ec3d0cda290b03fee55b72b49efc11 upstream.
We weren't clearing card->tx\_skb[port] when processing the TX done interrupt.
If there wasn't another skb ready to transmit immediately, this led to a
double-free because we'd free it \*again\* next time we did have a packet to
send.

cifs: adjust sequence number downward after signing NT\_CANCEL request
commit 31efee60f489c759c341454d755a9fd13de8c03d upstream.
When a call goes out, the signing code adjusts the sequence number
upward by two to account for the request and the response. An NT\_CANCEL
however doesn't get a response of its own, it just hurries the server
along to get it to respond to the original request more quickly.
Therefore, we must adjust the sequence number back down by one after
signing a NT\_CANCEL request.

This is likely due to a race vs. a reconnection event.
The current code checks for a NULL socket in smb\_send\_kvec, but that's
too late. By the time that check is done, the socket will already have
been passed to kernel\_setsockopt. Move the check into smb\_send\_rqst, so
that it's checked earlier.
In truth, this is a bit of a half-assed fix. The -ENOTSOCK error
return here looks like it could bubble back up to userspace. The locking
rules around the ssocket pointer are really unclear as well. There are
cases where the ssocket pointer is changed without holding the srv\_mutex,
but I'm not clear whether there's a potential race here yet or not.
This code seems like it could benefit from some fundamental re-think of
how the socket handling should behave. Until then though, this patch
should at least fix the above oops in most cases.

flush\_cache\_louis flushes the D-side caches to the point of unification

ARM: mm: use pteval\_t to represent page protection values
commit 864aa04cd02979c2c755cb28b5f4fe56039171c0 upstream.
When updating the page protection map after calculating the user\_pgprot
value, the base protection map is temporarily stored in an unsigned long
type, causing truncation of the protection bits when LPAE is enabled.
This effectively means that calls to mprotect() will corrupt the upper
page attributes, clearing the XN bit unconditionally.
This patch uses pteval\_t to store the intermediate protection values,
preserving the upper bits for 64-bit descriptors.

xfs: fix stray dquot unlock when reclaiming dquots
commit b870553cdecb26d5291af09602352b763e323df2 upstream.
When we fail to get a dquot lock during reclaim, we jump to an error
handler that unlocks the dquot. This is wrong as we didn't lock the
dquot, and unlocking it means who-ever is holding the lock has had
it silently taken away, and hence it results in a lock imbalance.
Found by inspection while modifying the code for the numa-lru
patchset. This fixes a random hang I've been seeing on xfstest 232
for the past several months.

xfs: fix direct IO nested transaction deadlock.
commit 437a255aa23766666aec78af63be4c253faa8d57 upstream.
The direct IO path can do a nested transaction reservation when
writing past the EOF. The first transaction is the append
transaction for setting the filesize at IO completion, but we can
also need a transaction for allocation of blocks. If the log is low
on space due to reservations and small log, the append transaction
can be granted after wating for space as the only active transaction
in the system. This then attempts a reservation for an allocation,
which there isn't space in the log for, and the reservation sleeps.
The result is that there is nothing left in the system to wake up
all the processes waiting for log space to come free.
The stack trace that shows this deadlock is relatively innocuous:
xlog\_grant\_head\_wait
xlog\_grant\_head\_check
xfs\_log\_reserve
xfs\_trans\_reserve
xfs\_iomap\_write\_direct
\_\_xfs\_get\_blocks
xfs\_get\_blocks\_direct
do\_blockdev\_direct\_IO
\_\_blockdev\_direct\_IO
xfs\_vm\_direct\_IO
generic\_file\_direct\_write
xfs\_file\_dio\_aio\_writ
xfs\_file\_aio\_write
do\_sync\_write
vfs\_write
This was discovered on a filesystem with a log of only 10MB, and a
log stripe unit of 256k whih increased the base reservations by
512k. Hence a allocation transaction requires 1.2MB of log space to
be available instead of only 260k, and so greatly increased the
chance that there wouldn't be enough log space available for the
nested transaction to succeed. The key to reproducing it is this
mkfs command:
mkfs.xfs -f -d agcount=16,su=256k,sw=12 -l su=256k,size=2560b $SCRATCH\_DEV
The test case was a 1000 fsstress processes running with random
freeze and unfreezes every few seconds. Thanks to Eryu Guan
(eguan@redhat.com) for writing the test that found this on a system
with a somewhat unique default configuration....

printk: fix incorrect length from print\_time() when seconds > 99999
commit 35dac27cedd14c3b6fcd4ba7bc3c31738cfd1831 upstream.
print\_prefix() passes a NULL buf to print\_time() to get the length of
the time prefix; when printk times are enabled, the current code just
returns the constant 15, which matches the format "[%5lu.%06lu] " used
to print the time value. However, this is obviously incorrect when the
whole seconds part of the time gets beyond 5 digits (100000 seconds is a
bit more than a day of uptime).
The simple fix is to use snprintf(NULL, 0, ...) to calculate the actual
length of the time prefix. This could be micro-optimized but it seems
better to have simpler, more readable code here.
The bug leads to the syslog system call miscomputing which messages fit
into the userspace buffer. If there are enough messages to fill
log\_buf\_len and some have a timestamp >= 100000, dmesg may fail with:
# dmesg
klogctl: Bad address
When this happens, strace shows that the failure is indeed EFAULT due to
the kernel mistakenly accessing past the end of dmesg's buffer, since
dmesg asks the kernel how big a buffer it needs, allocates a bit more,
and then gets an error when it asks the kernel to fill it:
syslog(0xa, 0, 0) = 1048576
mmap(NULL, 1052672, PROT\_READ|PROT\_WRITE, MAP\_PRIVATE|MAP\_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7fa4d25d2000
syslog(0x3, 0x7fa4d25d2010, 0x100008) = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
As far as I can see, the bug has been there as long as print\_time(),
which comes from commit 084681d14e42 ("printk: flush continuation lines
immediately to console") in 3.5-rc5.

tcp: fix MSG\_SENDPAGE\_NOTLAST logic
[ Upstream commit ae62ca7b03217be5e74759dc6d7698c95df498b3 ]
commit 35f9c09fe9c72e (tcp: tcp\_sendpages() should call tcp\_push() once)
added an internal flag : MSG\_SENDPAGE\_NOTLAST meant to be set on all
frags but the last one for a splice() call.
The condition used to set the flag in pipe\_to\_sendpage() relied on
splice() user passing the exact number of bytes present in the pipe,
or a smaller one.
But some programs pass an arbitrary high value, and the test fails.
The effect of this bug is a lack of tcp\_push() at the end of a
splice(pipe -> socket) call, and possibly very slow or erratic TCP
sessions.
We should both test sd->total\_len and fact that another fragment
is in the pipe (pipe->nrbufs > 1)
Many thanks to Willy for providing very clear bug report, bisection
and test programs.

ipv6: Change skb->data before using icmpv6\_notify() to propagate redirect
[ Upstream commit 093d04d42fa094f6740bb188f0ad0c215ff61e2c ]
In function ndisc\_redirect\_rcv(), the skb->data points to the transport
header, but function icmpv6\_notify() need the skb->data points to the
inner IP packet. So before using icmpv6\_notify() to propagate redirect,
change skb->data to point the inner IP packet that triggered the sending
of the Redirect, and introduce struct rd\_msg to make it easy.

inet: Fix kmemleak in tcp\_v4/6\_syn\_recv\_sock and dccp\_v4/6\_request\_recv\_sock

This happens, because sk\_clone\_lock initializes sk\_refcnt to 2, and thus
a single sock\_put() is not enough to free the memory. Additionally, things
like xfrm, memcg, cookie\_values,... may have been initialized.
We have to free them properly.
This is fixed by forcing a call to tcp\_done(), ending up in
inet\_csk\_destroy\_sock, doing the final sock\_put(). tcp\_done() is necessary,
because it ends up doing all the cleanup on xfrm, memcg, cookie\_values,
xfrm,...
Before calling tcp\_done, we have to set the socket to SOCK\_DEAD, to
force it entering inet\_csk\_destroy\_sock. To avoid the warning in
inet\_csk\_destroy\_sock, inet\_num has to be set to 0.
As inet\_csk\_destroy\_sock does a dec on orphan\_count, we first have to
increase it.
Calling tcp\_done() allows us to remove the calls to
tcp\_clear\_xmit\_timer() and tcp\_cleanup\_congestion\_control().
A similar approach is taken for dccp by calling dccp\_done().
This is in the kernel since 093d282321 (tproxy: fix hash locking issue
when using port redirection in \_\_inet\_inherit\_port()), thus since
version >= 2.6.37.

batman-adv: fix random jitter calculation
[ Upstream commit 143cdd8f33909ff5a153e3f02048738c5964ba26 ]
batadv\_iv\_ogm\_emit\_send\_time() attempts to calculates a random integer
in the range of 'orig\_interval +- BATADV\_JITTER' by the below lines.
msecs = atomic\_read(&bat\_priv->orig\_interval) - BATADV\_JITTER;
msecs += (random32() % 2 \* BATADV\_JITTER);
But it actually gets 'orig\_interval' or 'orig\_interval - BATADV\_JITTER'
because '%' and '\*' have same precedence and associativity is
left-to-right.
This adds the parentheses at the appropriate position so that it matches
original intension.

sparc64: Fix unrolled AES 256-bit key loops.
[ Upstream commit 9f28ffc03e93343ac04874fda9edb7affea45165 ]
The basic scheme of the block mode assembler is that we start by
enabling the FPU, loading the key into the floating point registers,
then iterate calling the encrypt/decrypt routine for each block.
For the 256-bit key cases, we run short on registers in the unrolled
loops.
So the {ENCRYPT,DECRYPT}\_256\_2() macros reload the key registers that
get clobbered.
The unrolled macros, {ENCRYPT,DECRYPT}\_256(), are not mindful of this.
So if we have a mix of multi-block and single-block calls, the
single-block unrolled 256-bit encrypt/decrypt can run with some
of the key registers clobbered.
Handle this by always explicitly loading those registers before using
the non-unrolled 256-bit macro.
This was discovered thanks to all of the new test cases added by
Jussi Kivilinna.

freezer: add missing mb's to freezer\_count() and freezer\_should\_skip()
commit dd67d32dbc5de299d70cc9e10c6c1e29ffa56b92 upstream.
A task is considered frozen enough between freezer\_do\_not\_count() and
freezer\_count() and freezers use freezer\_should\_skip() to test this
condition. This supposedly works because freezer\_count() always calls
try\_to\_freezer() after clearing %PF\_FREEZER\_SKIP.
However, there currently is nothing which guarantees that
freezer\_count() sees %true freezing() after clearing %PF\_FREEZER\_SKIP
when freezing is in progress, and vice-versa. A task can escape the
freezing condition in effect by freezer\_count() seeing !freezing() and
freezer\_should\_skip() seeing %PF\_FREEZER\_SKIP.
This patch adds smp\_mb()'s to freezer\_count() and
freezer\_should\_skip() such that either %true freezing() is visible to
freezer\_count() or !PF\_FREEZER\_SKIP is visible to
freezer\_should\_skip().

SMB3 mounts fail with access denied to some servers
commit 52c0f4ad8ed462d81f1d37f56a74a71dc0c9bf0f upstream.
We were checking incorrectly if signatures were required to be sent,
so were always sending signatures after the initial session establishment.
For SMB3 mounts (vers=3.0) this was a problem because we were putting
SMB2 signatures in SMB3 requests which would cause access denied
on mount (the tree connection would fail).
This might also be worth considering for stable (for 3.7), as the
error message on mount (access denied) is confusing to users and
there is no workaround if the server is configured to only
support smb3.0. I am ok either way.

cgroup: cgroup\_subsys->fork() should be called after the task is added to css\_set
commit 5edee61edeaaebafe584f8fb7074c1ef4658596b upstream.
cgroup core has a bug which violates a basic rule about event
notifications - when a new entity needs to be added, you add that to
the notification list first and then make the new entity conform to
the current state. If done in the reverse order, an event happening
inbetween will be lost.
cgroup\_subsys->fork() is invoked way before the new task is added to
the css\_set. Currently, cgroup\_freezer is the only user of ->fork()
and uses it to make new tasks conform to the current state of the
freezer. If FROZEN state is requested while fork is in progress
between cgroup\_fork\_callbacks() and cgroup\_post\_fork(), the child
could escape freezing - the cgroup isn't frozen when ->fork() is
called and the freezer couldn't see the new task on the css\_set.
This patch moves cgroup\_subsys->fork() invocation to
cgroup\_post\_fork() after the new task is added to the css\_set.
cgroup\_fork\_callbacks() is removed.
Because now a task may be migrated during cgroup\_subsys->fork(),
freezer\_fork() is updated so that it adheres to the usual RCU locking
and the rather pointless comment on why locking can be different there
is removed (if it doesn't make anything simpler, why even bother?).

USB: fix endpoint-disabling for failed config changes
commit 36caff5d795429c572443894e8789c2150dd796b upstream.
This patch (as1631) fixes a bug that shows up when a config change
fails for a device under an xHCI controller. The controller needs to
be told to disable the endpoints that have been enabled for the new
config. The existing code does this, but before storing the
information about which endpoints were enabled! As a result, any
second attempt to install the new config is doomed to fail because
xhci-hcd will refuse to enable an endpoint that is already enabled.
The patch optimistically initializes the new endpoints' device
structures before asking the device to switch to the new config. If
the request fails then the endpoint information is already stored, so
we can use usb\_hcd\_alloc\_bandwidth() to disable the endpoints with no
trouble. The rest of the error path is slightly more complex now; we
have to disable the new interfaces and call put\_device() rather than
simply deallocating them.

xhci: fix null-pointer dereference when destroying half-built segment rings
commit 68e5254adb88bede68285f11fb442a4d34fb550c upstream.
xhci\_alloc\_segments\_for\_ring() builds a list of xhci\_segments and links
the tail to head at the end (forming a ring). When it bails out for OOM
reasons half-way through, it tries to destroy its half-built list with
xhci\_free\_segments\_for\_ring(), even though it is not a ring yet. This
causes a null-pointer dereference upon hitting the last element.
Furthermore, one of its callers (xhci\_ring\_alloc()) mistakenly believes
the output parameters to be valid upon this kind of OOM failure, and
calls xhci\_ring\_free() on them. Since the (incomplete) list/ring should
already be destroyed in that case, this would lead to a use after free.
This patch fixes those issues by having xhci\_alloc\_segments\_for\_ring()
destroy its half-built, non-circular list manually and destroying the
invalid struct xhci\_ring in xhci\_ring\_alloc() with a plain kfree().
This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that
contains the commit 0ebbab37422315a5d0cb29792271085bafdf38c0 "USB: xhci:
Ring allocation and initialization."
A separate patch will need to be developed for kernels older than 3.4,
since the ring allocation code was refactored in that kernel.

xHCI: Fix TD Size calculation on 1.0 hosts.
commit 4525c0a10dff7ad3669763c28016c7daffc3900e upstream.
The xHCI 1.0 specification made a change to the TD Size field in TRBs.
The value is now the number of packets that remain to be sent in the TD,
not including this TRB. The TD Size value for the last TRB in a TD must
always be zero.
The xHCI function xhci\_v1\_0\_td\_remainder() attempts to calculate this,
but it gets it wrong. First, it erroneously reuses the old
xhci\_td\_remainder function, which will right shift the value by 10. The
xHCI 1.0 spec as of June 2011 says nothing about right shifting by 10.
Second, it does not set the TD size for the last TRB in a TD to zero.
Third, it uses roundup instead of DIV\_ROUND\_UP. The total packet count
is supposed to be the total number of bytes in this TD, divided by the
max packet size, rounded up. DIV\_ROUND\_UP is the right function to use
in that case.
With the old code, a TD on an endpoint with max packet size 1024 would
be set up like so:
TRB 1, TRB length = 600 bytes, TD size = 0
TRB 1, TRB length = 200 bytes, TD size = 0
TRB 1, TRB length = 100 bytes, TD size = 0
With the new code, the TD would be set up like this:
TRB 1, TRB length = 600 bytes, TD size = 1
TRB 1, TRB length = 200 bytes, TD size = 1
TRB 1, TRB length = 100 bytes, TD size = 0
This commit should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contain

xhci: Fix conditional check in bandwidth calculation.
commit 392a07ae3316f2b90b39ce41e66d6f6b5c95de90 upstream.
David reports that at drivers/usb/host/xhci.c:2257:
static bool xhci\_is\_sync\_in\_ep(unsigned int ep\_type)
{
return (ep\_type == ISOC\_IN\_EP || ep\_type != INT\_IN\_EP);
}
The static analyser cppcheck says
[linux-3.7-rc2/drivers/usb/host/xhci.c:2257]: (style) Redundant condition: If ep\_type == 5, the comparison ep\_type != 7 is always true.
Maybe the original programmer intention was something like
static bool xhci\_is\_sync\_in\_ep(unsigned int ep\_type)
{
return (ep\_type == ISOC\_IN\_EP || ep\_type == INT\_IN\_EP);
}
Fix this.

genirq: Always force thread affinity
commit 04aa530ec04f61875b99c12721162e2964e3318c upstream.
Sankara reported that the genirq core code fails to adjust the
affinity of an interrupt thread in several cases:
1) On request/setup\_irq() the call to setup\_affinity() happens before
the new action is registered, so the new thread is not notified.
2) For secondary shared interrupts nothing notifies the new thread to
change its affinity.
3) Interrupts which have the IRQ\_NO\_BALANCE flag set are not moving
the thread either.
Fix this by setting the thread affinity flag right on thread creation
time. This ensures that under all circumstances the thread moves to
the right place. Requires a check in irq\_thread\_check\_affinity for an
existing affinity mask (CONFIG\_CPU\_MASK\_OFFSTACK=y)

{ cd /mnt; umount -l /mnt ; ls -l /proc/self/cwd; }
will cause a WARN message like

nfsd: avoid permission checks on EXCLUSIVE\_CREATE replay
commit 7007c90fb9fef593b4aeaeee57e6a6754276c97c upstream.
With NFSv4, if we create a file then open it we explicit avoid checking
the permissions on the file during the open because the fact that we
created it ensures we should be allow to open it (the create and the
open should appear to be a single operation).
However if the reply to an EXCLUSIVE create gets lots and the client
resends the create, the current code will perform the permission check -
because it doesn't realise that it did the open already..
This patch should fix this.
Note that I haven't actually seen this cause a problem. I was just
looking at the code trying to figure out a different EXCLUSIVE open
related issue, and this looked wrong.

NFS: Don't use SetPageError in the NFS writeback code
commit ada8e20d044c0fa5610e504ce6fb4578ebd3edd9 upstream.
The writeback code is already capable of passing errors back to user space
by means of the open\_context->error. In the case of ENOSPC, Neil Brown
is reporting seeing 2 errors being returned.
Neil writes:
"e.g. if /mnt2/ if an nfs mounted filesystem that has no space then
strace dd if=/dev/zero conv=fsync >> /mnt2/afile count=1
reported Input/output error and the relevant parts of the strace output are:
write(1, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 512) = 512
fsync(1) = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
close(1) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device)"
Neil then shows that the duplication of error messages appears to be due to
the use of the PageError() mechanism, which causes filemap\_fdatawait\_range
to return the extra EIO. The regression was introduced by
commit 7b281ee026552f10862b617a2a51acf49c829554 (NFS: fsync() must exit
with an error if page writeback failed).
Fix this by removing the call to SetPageError(), and just relying on
open\_context->error reporting the ENOSPC back to fsync().

NFS: Fix calls to drop\_nlink()
commit 1f018458b30b0d5c535c94e577aa0acbb92e1395 upstream.
It is almost always wrong for NFS to call drop\_nlink() after removing a
file. What we really want is to mark the inode's attributes for
revalidation, and we want to ensure that the VFS drops it if we're
reasonably sure that this is the final unlink().
Do the former using the usual cache validity flags, and the latter
by testing if inode->i\_nlink == 1, and clearing it in that case.
This also fixes the following warning reported by Neil Brown and
Jeff Layton (among others).

NFS: avoid NULL dereference in nfs\_destroy\_server
commit f259613a1e4b44a0cf85a5dafd931be96ee7c9e5 upstream.
In rare circumstances, nfs\_clone\_server() of a v2 or v3 server can get
an error between setting server->destory (to nfs\_destroy\_server), and
calling nfs\_start\_lockd (which will set server->nlm\_host).
If this happens, nfs\_clone\_server will call nfs\_free\_server which
will call nfs\_destroy\_server and thence nlmclnt\_done(NULL). This
causes the NULL to be dereferenced.
So add a guard to only call nlmclnt\_done() if ->nlm\_host is not NULL.
The other guards there are irrelevant as nlm\_host can only be non-NULL
if one of these flags are set - so remove those tests. (Thanks to Trond
for this suggestion).
This is suitable for any stable kernel since 2.6.25.

would scribble over the rest of the stack page.
If we hit the end of the file on a DIO READ request, then we don't want

all, and there's no guarantee that the buffers that were passed in

\_\_nfs4\_get\_acl\_uncached" accidently dropped the checking for too small
result buffer length.
If someone uses getxattr on "system.nfs4\_acl" on an NFSv4 mount
supporting ACLs, the ACL has not been cached and the buffer suplied is
too short, we still copy the complete ACL, resulting in kernel and user
space memory corruption.

nfs: don't extend writes to cover entire page if pagecache is invalid
commit 81d9bce5309288086b58b4d97a644e495fef75f2 upstream.
Jian reported that the following sequence would leave "testfile" with
corrupt data:
# mount localhost:/export /mnt/nfs/ -o vers=3
# echo abc > /mnt/nfs/testfile; echo def >> /export/testfile; echo ghi >> /mnt/nfs/testfile
# cat -v /export/testfile
abc
^@^@^@^@ghi
While there's no locking involved here, the operations are serialized,
so CTO should prevent corruption.
The first write to the file is fine and writes 4 bytes. The file is then
extended on the server. When it's reopened a GETATTR is issued and the
size change is noticed. This causes NFS\_INO\_INVALID\_DATA to be set on
the file. Because the file is opened for write only,
nfs\_want\_read\_modify\_write() returns 0 to nfs\_write\_begin().
nfs\_updatepage then calls nfs\_write\_pageuptodate() to see if it should
extend the nfs\_page to cover the whole page. NFS\_INO\_INVALID\_DATA is
still set on the file at that point, but that flag is ignored and
nfs\_pageuptodate erroneously extends the write to cover the whole page,
with the write done on the server side filled in with zeroes.
This patch just has that function check for NFS\_INO\_INVALID\_DATA in
addition to NFS\_INO\_REVAL\_PAGECACHE. This fixes the bug, but looking
over the code, I wonder if we might have a similar bug in
nfs\_revalidate\_size(). The difference between those two flags is very
subtle, so it seems like we ought to be checking for
NFS\_INO\_INVALID\_DATA in most of the places that we look for
NFS\_INO\_REVAL\_PAGECACHE.
I believe this is regression introduced by commit 8d197a568. The code
did check for NFS\_INO\_INVALID\_DATA prior to that patch.

NFS: Add sequence\_priviliged\_ops for nfs4\_proc\_sequence()
commit 6bdb5f213c4344324f600dde885f25768fbd14db upstream.
If I mount an NFS v4.1 server to a single client multiple times and then
run xfstests over each mountpoint I usually get the client into a state
where recovery deadlocks. The server informs the client of a
cb\_path\_down sequence error, the client then does a
bind\_connection\_to\_session and checks the status of the lease.
I found that bind\_connection\_to\_session sets the NFS4\_SESSION\_DRAINING
flag on the client, but this flag is never unset before
nfs4\_check\_lease() reaches nfs4\_proc\_sequence(). This causes the client
to deadlock, halting all NFS activity to the server. nfs4\_proc\_sequence()
is only called by the state manager, so I can change it to run in privileged
mode to bypass the NFS4\_SESSION\_DRAINING check and avoid the deadlock.

libata: restore acpi disable functionality
commit 0d0cdb028f9d9771e2b346038707734121f906e3 upstream.
Commit 66fa7f215 "libata-acpi: improve ACPI disabling" introdcued the
behaviour of disabling ATA ACPI if ata\_acpi\_on\_devcfg failed the 2nd
time, but commit 30dcf76ac dropped this behaviour and this caused
problem for Dimitris Damigos, where his laptop can not resume correctly.
The bugzilla page for it is:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=49331
The problem is, ata\_dev\_push\_id will fail the 2nd time it is invoked,
and due to disabling ACPI code is dropped, ata\_acpi\_on\_devcfg which
calls ata\_dev\_push\_id will keep failing and eventually made the device
disabled.
This patch restores the original behaviour, if acpi failed the 2nd time,
disable acpi functionality for the device(and we do not event need to
add a debug message for this as it is still there ;-).

usb: gadget: uvc: fix error path in uvc\_function\_bind()
commit 0f9df939385527049c8062a099fbfa1479fe7ce0 upstream.
The "video->minor = -1" assigment is done in V4L2 by
video\_register\_device() so it is removed here.
Now. uvc\_function\_bind() calls in error case uvc\_function\_unbind() for
cleanup. The problem is that uvc\_function\_unbind() frees the uvc struct
and uvc\_bind\_config() does as well in error case of usb\_add\_function().
Removing kfree() in usb\_add\_function() would make the patch smaller but
it would look odd because the new allocated memory is not cleaned up.
However it is not guaranteed that if we call usb\_add\_function() we also
get to the bind function.
Therefore the patch extracts the conditional cleanup from
uvc\_function\_unbind() applies to uvc\_function\_bind().
uvc\_function\_unbind() now contains only the complete cleanup which is
required once everything has been registrated.

tmpfs mempolicy: fix /proc/mounts corrupting memory
commit f2a07f40dbc603c15f8b06e6ec7f768af67b424f upstream.
Recently I suggested using "mount -o remount,mpol=local /tmp" in NUMA
mempolicy testing. Very nasty. Reading /proc/mounts, /proc/pid/mounts
or /proc/pid/mountinfo may then corrupt one bit of kernel memory, often
in a page table (causing "Bad swap" or "Bad page map" warning or "Bad
pagetable" oops), sometimes in a vm\_area\_struct or rbnode or somewhere
worse. "mpol=prefer" and "mpol=prefer:Node" are equally toxic.
Recent NUMA enhancements are not to blame: this dates back to 2.6.35,
when commit e17f74af351c "mempolicy: don't call mpol\_set\_nodemask() when
no\_context" skipped mpol\_parse\_str()'s call to mpol\_set\_nodemask(),
which used to initialize v.preferred\_node, or set MPOL\_F\_LOCAL in flags.
With slab poisoning, you can then rely on mpol\_to\_str() to set the bit
for node 0x6b6b, probably in the next page above the caller's stack.
mpol\_parse\_str() is only called from shmem\_parse\_options(): no\_context
is always true, so call it unused for now, and remove !no\_context code.
Set v.nodes or v.preferred\_node or MPOL\_F\_LOCAL as mpol\_to\_str() might
expect. Then mpol\_to\_str() can ignore its no\_context argument also,
the mpol being appropriately initialized whether contextualized or not.
Rename its no\_context unused too, and let subsequent patch remove them
(that's not needed for stable backporting, which would involve rejects).
I don't understand why MPOL\_LOCAL is described as a pseudo-policy:
it's a reasonable policy which suffers from a confusing implementation
in terms of MPOL\_PREFERRED with MPOL\_F\_LOCAL. I believe this would be
much more robust if MPOL\_LOCAL were recognized in switch statements
throughout, MPOL\_F\_LOCAL deleted, and MPOL\_PREFERRED use the (possibly
empty) nodes mask like everyone else, instead of its preferred\_node
variant (I presume an optimization from the days before MPOL\_LOCAL).
But that would take me too long to get right and fully tested.

mm: Fix PageHead when !CONFIG\_PAGEFLAGS\_EXTENDED
commit ad4b3fb7ff9940bcdb1e4cd62bd189d10fa636ba upstream.
Unfortunately with !CONFIG\_PAGEFLAGS\_EXTENDED, (!PageHead) is false, and
(PageHead) is true, for tail pages. If this is indeed the intended
behavior, which I doubt because it breaks cache cleaning on some ARM
systems, then the nomenclature is highly problematic.
This patch makes sure PageHead is only true for head pages and PageTail
is only true for tail pages, and neither is true for non-compound pages.
[ This buglet seems ancient - seems to have been introduced back in Apr
2008 in commit 6a1e7f777f61: "pageflags: convert to the use of new
macros". And the reason nobody noticed is because the PageHead()
tests are almost all about just sanity-checking, and only used on
pages that are actual page heads. The fact that the old code returned
true for tail pages too was thus not really noticeable. - Linus ]

mm: fix calculation of dirtyable memory
commit c8b74c2f6604923de91f8aa6539f8bb934736754 upstream.
The system uses global\_dirtyable\_memory() to calculate number of
dirtyable pages/pages that can be allocated to the page cache. A bug
causes an underflow thus making the page count look like a big unsigned
number. This in turn confuses the dirty writeback throttling to
aggressively write back pages as they become dirty (usually 1 page at a
time). This generally only affects systems with highmem because the
underflowed count gets subtracted from the global count of dirtyable
memory.
The problem was introduced with v3.2-4896-gab8fabd
Fix is to ensure we don't get an underflowed total of either highmem or
global dirtyable memory.

virtio: force vring descriptors to be allocated from lowmem
commit b92b1b89a33c172c075edccf6afb0edc41d851fd upstream.
Virtio devices may attempt to add descriptors to a virtqueue from atomic
context using GFP\_ATOMIC allocation. This is problematic because such
allocations can fall outside of the lowmem mapping, causing virt\_to\_phys
to report bogus physical addresses which are subsequently passed to
userspace via the buffers for the virtual device.
This patch masks out \_\_GFP\_HIGH and \_\_GFP\_HIGHMEM from the requested
flags when allocating descriptors for a virtqueue. If an atomic
allocation is requested and later fails, we will return -ENOSPC which
will be handled by the driver.

virtio: 9p: correctly pass physical address to userspace for high pages
commit b9cdc88df8e63e81c723b82c286fc97f5d0dc325 upstream.
When using a virtio transport, the 9p net device may pass the physical
address of a kernel buffer to userspace via a scatterlist inside a
virtqueue. If the kernel buffer is mapped outside of the linear mapping
(e.g. highmem), then virt\_to\_page will return a bogus value and we will
populate the scatterlist with junk.
This patch uses kmap\_to\_page when populating the page array for a kernel
buffer.

mm: highmem: export kmap\_to\_page for modules
commit f0263d2d222e9e25f2587e51a9dc58c6fb2a9352 upstream.
Some virtio device drivers (9p) need to translate high virtual addresses
to physical addresses, which are inserted into the virtqueue for
processing by userspace.
This patch exports the kmap\_to\_page symbol, so that the affected drivers
can be compiled as modules.

x86, 8042: Enable A20 using KBC to fix S3 resume on some MSI laptops
commit ad68652412276f68ad4fe3e1ecf5ee6880876783 upstream.
Some MSI laptop BIOSes are broken - INT 15h code uses port 92h to enable A20
line but resume code assumes that KBC was used.
The laptop will not resume from S3 otherwise but powers off after a while
and then powers on again stuck with a blank screen.
Fix it by enabling A20 using KBC in i8042\_platform\_init for x86.

arm64: signal: push the unwinding prologue on the signal stack
commit 304ef4e8367244b547734143c792a2ab764831e8 upstream.
To allow debuggers to unwind through signal frames, we create a fake
stack unwinding prologue containing the link register and frame pointer
of the interrupted context. The signal frame is then offset by 16 bytes
to make room for the two saved registers which are pushed onto the frame
of the \*interrupted\* context, rather than placed directly above the
signal stack.
This doesn't work when an alternative signal stack is set up for a SEGV
handler, which is raised in response to RLIMIT\_STACK being reached. In
this case, we try to push the unwinding prologue onto the full stack and
subsequently take a fault which we fail to resolve, causing setup\_return
to return -EFAULT and handle\_signal to force\_sigsegv on the current task.
This patch fixes the problem by including the unwinding prologue as part
of the rt\_sigframe definition, which is populated during setup\_sigframe,
ensuring that it always ends up on the signal stack.

exec: do not leave bprm->interp on stack
commit b66c5984017533316fd1951770302649baf1aa33 upstream.
If a series of scripts are executed, each triggering module loading via
unprintable bytes in the script header, kernel stack contents can leak
into the command line.
Normally execution of binfmt\_script and binfmt\_misc happens recursively.
However, when modules are enabled, and unprintable bytes exist in the
bprm->buf, execution will restart after attempting to load matching
binfmt modules. Unfortunately, the logic in binfmt\_script and
binfmt\_misc does not expect to get restarted. They leave bprm->interp
pointing to their local stack. This means on restart bprm->interp is
left pointing into unused stack memory which can then be copied into the
userspace argv areas.
After additional study, it seems that both recursion and restart remains
the desirable way to handle exec with scripts, misc, and modules. As
such, we need to protect the changes to interp.
This changes the logic to require allocation for any changes to the
bprm->interp. To avoid adding a new kmalloc to every exec, the default
value is left as-is. Only when passing through binfmt\_script or
binfmt\_misc does an allocation take place.
For a proof of concept, see DoTest.sh from:

SGI-XP: handle non-fatal traps
commit 891348ca0f66206f1dc0e30d63757e3df1ae2d15 upstream.
We found a user code which was raising a divide-by-zero trap. That trap
would lead to XPC connections between system-partitions being torn down
due to the die\_chain notifier callouts it received.
This also revealed a different issue where multiple callers into
xpc\_die\_deactivate() would all attempt to do the disconnect in parallel
which would sometimes lock up but often overwhelm the console on very
large machines as each would print at least one line of output at the
end of the deactivate.
I reviewed all the users of the die\_chain notifier and changed the code
to ignore the notifier callouts for reasons which will not actually lead
to a system to continue on to call die().

b43legacy: Fix firmware loading when driver is built into the kernel
commit 576d28a7c73013717311cfcb514dbcae27c82eeb upstream.
Recent versions of udev cause synchronous firmware loading from the
probe routine to fail because the request to user space times out.
The original fix for b43legacy (commit a3ea2c7) moved the firmware
load from the probe routine to a work queue, but it still used synchronous
firmware loading. This method is OK when b43legacy is built as a module;
however, it fails when the driver is compiled into the kernel.
This version changes the code to load the initial firmware file
using request\_firmware\_nowait(). A completion event is used to
hold the work queue until that file is available. The remaining
firmware files are read synchronously.

firmware loader: Fix the concurrent request\_firmware() race for kref\_get/put
commit bd9eb7fbe69111ea0ff1f999ef4a5f26d223d1d5 upstream.
There is one race that both request\_firmware() with the same
firmware name.
The race scenerio is as below:
CPU1 CPU2
request\_firmware() -->
\_request\_firmware\_load() return err another request\_firmware() is coming -->
\_request\_firmware\_cleanup is called --> \_request\_firmware\_prepare -->
release\_firmware ---> fw\_lookup\_and\_allocate\_buf -->
spin\_lock(&fwc->lock)
... \_\_fw\_lookup\_buf() return true
fw\_free\_buf() will be called --> ...
kref\_put -->
decrease the refcount to 0
kref\_get(&tmp->ref) ==> it will trigger warning
due to refcount == 0
\_\_fw\_free\_buf() -->
... spin\_unlock(&fwc->lock)
spin\_lock(&fwc->lock)
list\_del(&buf->list)
spin\_unlock(&fwc->lock)
kfree(buf)
After that, the freed buf will be used.
The key race is decreasing refcount to 0 and list\_del is not protected together by
fwc->lock, and it is possible another thread try to get it between refcount==0
and list\_del.
Fix it here to protect it together.

firmware loader: Fix the race FW\_STATUS\_DONE is followed by class\_timeout
commit ce2fcbd99cef580623116bb33531dbc3e6f690b0 upstream.
There is a race as below when calling request\_firmware():
CPU1 CPU2
write 0 > loading
mutex\_lock(&fw\_lock)
...
set\_bit FW\_STATUS\_DONE class\_timeout is coming
set\_bit FW\_STATUS\_ABORT
complete\_all &completion
...
mutex\_unlock(&fw\_lock)
In this time, the bit FW\_STATUS\_DONE and FW\_STATUS\_ABORT are set,
and request\_firmware() will return failure due to condition in
\_request\_firmware\_load():
if (!buf->size || test\_bit(FW\_STATUS\_ABORT, &buf->status))
retval = -ENOENT;
But from the above scenerio, it should be a successful requesting.
So we need judge if the bit FW\_STATUS\_DONE is already set before
calling fw\_load\_abort() in timeout function.
As Ming's proposal, we need change the timer into sched\_work to
benefit from using &fw\_lock mutex also.

net: fix a race in gro\_cell\_poll()
[ Upstream commit f8e8f97c11d5ff3cc47d85b97c7c35e443dcf490 ]
Dmitry Kravkov reported packet drops for GRE packets since GRO support
was added.
There is a race in gro\_cell\_poll() because we call napi\_complete()
without any synchronization with a concurrent gro\_cells\_receive()
Once bug was triggered, we queued packets but did not schedule NAPI
poll.
We can fix this issue using the spinlock protected the napi\_skbs queue,
as we have to hold it to perform skb dequeue anyway.
As we open-code skb\_dequeue(), we no longer need to mask IRQS, as both
producer and consumer run under BH context.
Bug added in commit c9e6bc644e (net: add gro\_cells infrastructure)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1031702#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-11-18 15:10:11 UTC  ``` When a user memory slot is moved (ie. the base_gfn changes), iommu pages are neither unpinned nor unmapped.  The memory for these pages then cannot be recovered without rebooting the system.  Local user with ability to assign device (with access to PCI sysfs files for a device) could use this flaw to DoS the system.  Upstream fixes: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=12d6e7538e2d418c08f082b1b44ffa5fb7270ed8> <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e40f193f5bb022e927a57a4f5d5194e4f12ddb74>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1031702#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-21 20:37:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1645 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1645.html>   ``` |  |

NFSv4: Check for buffer length in \_\_nfs4\_get\_acl\_uncached

Commit [1f1ea6c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1f1ea6c2d9d8c0be9ec56454b05315273b5de8ce) "NFSv4: Fix buffer overflow checking in
__nfs4_get_acl_uncached" accidently dropped the checking for too small
result buffer length.

If someone uses getxattr on "system.nfs4_acl" on an NFSv4 mount
supporting ACLs, the ACL has not been cached and the buffer suplied is
too short, we still copy the complete ACL, resulting in kernel and user
space memory corruption.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1031678#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-11-18 14:29:50 UTC  ``` Commit 1f1ea6c (included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as part of [CVE-2012-2375](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2375) fix) accidently dropped the checking for too small result buffer length.     If someone uses getxattr on "system.nfs4_acl" on an NFSv4 mount supporting ACLs, the ACL has not been cached and the buffer suplied is too short, we still copy the complete ACL, resulting in kernel and user space memory corruption.  Introduced by: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1f1ea6c2d9d8c0be9ec56454b05315273b5de8ce>  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7d3e91a89b7adbc2831334def9e494dd9892f9af>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1031678#c1)  Petr Matousek    2013-11-18 14:32:43 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1031678#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-21 20:36:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1645 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1645.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1031678#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-11 17:08:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2014:0284 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0284.html>   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 kernel update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1645)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, address several
hundred bugs, and add numerous enhancements are now available as part of
the ongoing support and maintenance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.
This is the fifth regular update.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-4387, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the creation of

temporary IPv6 addresses. If the IPv6 privacy extension was enabled
(/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use\_tempaddr set to '2'), an attacker on the
local network could disable IPv6 temporary address generation, leading to a
potential information disclosure. (CVE-2013-0343, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled HID (Human Interface

Device) reports with an out-of-bounds Report ID. An attacker with physical
access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888,
Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in

the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead
to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected
when ANSI CPRNG was used. (CVE-2013-4345, Moderate)

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-2375 released via RHSA-2012:1580

accidentally removed a check for small-sized result buffers. A local,
unprivileged user with access to an NFSv4 mount with ACL support could use
this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
the system . (CVE-2013-4591, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way IOMMU memory mappings were handled when

moving memory slots. A malicious user on a KVM host who has the ability to
assign a device to a guest could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2013-4592, Moderate)

* Heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the Zeroplus and

Pantherlord/GreenAsia game controllers handled HID reports. An attacker
with physical access to the system could use these flaws to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-2889, CVE-2013-2892, Moderate)

* Two information leak flaws were found in the logical link control (LLC)

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use
these flaws to leak kernel stack memory to user space. (CVE-2012-6542,
CVE-2013-3231, Low)

* A heap-based buffer overflow in the way the tg3 Ethernet driver parsed

the vital product data (VPD) of devices could allow an attacker with
physical access to a system to cause a denial of service or, potentially,
escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1929, Low)

* Information leak flaws in the Linux kernel could allow a privileged,

local user to leak kernel memory to user space. (CVE-2012-6545,
CVE-2013-1928, CVE-2013-2164, CVE-2013-2234, Low)

* A format string flaw was found in the Linux kernel's block layer.

A privileged, local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their
privileges to kernel level (ring0). (CVE-2013-2851, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Stephan Mueller for reporting CVE-2013-4345,
and Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2013-2851.

This update also fixes several hundred bugs and adds enhancements. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Release Notes for information on the most
significant of these changes, and the Technical Notes for further
information, both linked to in the References.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 users are advised to install these updated
packages, which correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Release Notes and
Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

Subject: CVE-2013-4591 -- Linux kernel: kernel: nfs: missing check for buffer
 length in __nfs4_get_acl_uncached

Commit 1f1ea6c ccidently dropped the checking for too small result
buffer length.

If someone uses getxattr on "system.nfs4_acl" on an NFSv4 mount
supporting ACLs, the ACL has not been cached and the buffer suplied is
too short, we still copy the complete ACL, resulting in kernel and user
space memory corruption.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
