      "root_cause": "Incorrect function call in the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation when handling UDP_CORK option. Specifically, `udp_v6_push_pending_frames` function incorrectly calls `ip6_push_pending_frames` even when dealing with AF_INET data, leading to memory corruption.",

    "additonal_details": "The provided information includes details from various sources such as Ubuntu Security Notices, Red Hat Security Advisories, and kernel commit messages.  These sources offer more specific detail about the vulnerability and its impact within specific Linux distributions and kernel versions. Specifically, Red Hat identified the vulnerability as present in their kernel implementation. There are indications about incorrect handling with different address families when using UDP_CORK and IPv6 stacks, which might not be obvious from the CVE description itself.  There is also mention about the bug was found by Dave Jones using trinity test suite, which provides some context how the bug was discovered."
