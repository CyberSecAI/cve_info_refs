Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4472:

**Verification:**

The provided content explicitly states: "Please use CVE-2013-4472 for the Race condition on temporary file". This confirms that the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure way temporary files are created, specifically the use of `tmpnam()` on non-Unix systems combined with a race condition. The code generates a temporary filename and then opens the file using the generated name, where an attacker can create a symlink with the same name after the `tmpnam()` call but before the `fopen()` call.
Additionally, on Windows, the code uses `getenv("TEMP")` and relies on the process and thread ID as part of the filename which leads to a race condition vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Race condition:** On Windows, the code attempts to create a unique filename based on process ID, thread ID and time, and iterate through a sequence of potential filenames until it finds one that is not already used; however, an attacker can create this file between the check for a file existance and the file creation.
*   **Insecure temporary file creation:** On non-Unix systems the code uses `tmpnam()` which produces a predictable filename, allowing a malicious user to create a symlink with the same name between the `tmpnam()` and `fopen()` calls, leading to a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can replace the intended temporary file with a symbolic link, redirecting subsequent file operations to a location they control.
*   This could potentially lead to arbitrary file overwrite, information disclosure, or other security issues depending on how the temporary file is used by the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the application uses the `openTempFile` function on non-Unix operating systems such as older MacOS, Windows, VMS, EMX, or ACORN systems.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks or files in the temporary directory used by the application.
*   The attacker needs to race the application in file creation, creating the malicious symlink between the `tmpnam` and `fopen` calls (non-unix systems) or exploiting the time between the check of file existance and the file creation on windows.
