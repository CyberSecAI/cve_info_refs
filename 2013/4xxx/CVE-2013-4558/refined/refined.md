Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `get_parent_resource` function within the `mod_dav_svn` module of Subversion. When `SVNAutoversioning` is enabled, this function doesn't properly canonicalize URLs before processing them. This can trigger an assertion failure due to non-canonical URLs (e.g., URLs with trailing slashes) which leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Non-Canonical URL Handling:** The `get_parent_resource` function does not properly normalize the URL before use which leads to an assertion failure
- **Assertion Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered when Subversion is built with assertions enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to an assertion failure, causing the Apache HTTPD process to abort.
- **Service Disruption:**  While a prefork MPM server will restart the process, threaded MPM servers might have other requests affected, also causing an increased processing impact of restarting a process and the cost of per-process caches being lost.
- **Loss of Caches:** If the http server process aborts there is a loss of per-process caches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests using methods like `PUT` or `MKCOL` which include non-canonical URLs.
- **Non-canonical URLs:**  URLs with trailing slashes (`/`) or other variations are used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Commit Access:** The attacker must have commit access to the Subversion repository.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to be aware of the vulnerability and how to craft a malicious request.
- **SVNAutoversioning enabled:** The Subversion server must have `SVNAutoversioning` enabled.
- **Assertions Enabled:** Subversion must be built with assertions enabled during compilation for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `mod_dav_svn` versions 1.7.11 through 1.7.13 and 1.8.1 through 1.8.4.
- The fix involves canonicalizing the paths using `svn_urlpath__canonicalize()` before processing it.
- The fix was included in mod\_dav\_svn versions 1.7.14 and 1.8.5.
- The vulnerability is rated as low risk due to the requirements for exploitation.
- The issue does not affect the versions of Subversion in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
- The vulnerability was reported by Philip Martin of WANdisco.
