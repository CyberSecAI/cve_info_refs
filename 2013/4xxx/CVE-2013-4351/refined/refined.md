{
  "Root cause": "GnuPG misinterpreted key flags in PGP key packets, treating keys with no-usage-permitted flags as having all-usages-permitted flags.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of key flags within GnuPG.",
    "Misinterpretation of key flags leading to unintended use permissions."
  ],
  "Impact": "A key with intended 'no use permitted' flags would be treated as having all usage permissions. This could lead to a breach of confidentiality or a mistaken identity verification. For example, an attacker could potentially decrypt communications or forge a certification using a subkey that was intended to have no usage permissions.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a PGP key with 'no use permitted' flags.",
    "The attack requires the victim to use GnuPG to process a specially crafted key.",
        "The attacker needs to have the user import or use a specially crafted key"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to generate a PGP key with the specific configuration of no-usage-permitted key flags. They need to trick the user into using the key in some way, such as encrypting data or verifying a signature.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is triggered when a key or subkey has the 'key flags' subpacket attached with all bits cleared (off).  GnuPG misinterprets this as all bits being set (on). Such 'no use permitted' keys are rare and used in special circumstances. Successful exploitation requires not just processing the malformed key, but using the key in a way that it was intended to be restricted from."
