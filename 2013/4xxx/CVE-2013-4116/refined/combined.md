world-writable directories is the usual gateway to a vulnerability here.

# CVE-2013-4116

| **Name** | CVE-2013-4116 |

Issue reproduced.
As a quick workaround, you can create ~/tmp and npm will use that instead.
Otherwise i believe those leftovers are a bug.

I haven't tried to reproduce this yet, but it sounds to me like you
might be saying that the names of the /tmp/npm-# folders might be
predictably named (e.g. named after the process id).  Is this the case?
 If so, has anyone considered the possibility of an attack via
predictable paths in a world-writable directory?

it's buggy if it doesn't clean up, regardless of which tmp directory it
uses.  and npm should probably be respecting $TMPDIR directly following
the standard unix conventions, rather than just assuming that the
magically-named ~/tmp is preferable to /tmp.

I am curious about how `npm install mymodule` could be a target for an attacker,
especially considering the temp directory is used only once (at (un)tar times).

This is what i meant by writing "issue reproduced".

Agreed, the workaround i proposed is completely wrong,
please read what `man npm-config` says about TMPDIR instead.

if the tmpdir is predictably-named (e.g. it is /tmp/npm-$PID), then an
attacker could watch the process table for a process named "npm", and as
soon as it appears (say, as pid 13577, create a symlink at
/tmp/npm-13577 that points to, say, the home directory of the user npm,
which might have the effect of clobbering any similarly-named files.

This is a crude attack, but depending on the contents of the tarball it
could be pretty unfortunate (e.g. if the tarball contains a file named
secring.gpg, and the attacker points the symlink to the victim's
~/.gnupg ?).

<http://sources.debian.net/src/npm/1.2.18~dfsg-3/doc/cli/config.md#L756>
suggests that it is supposed to use TMPDIR, which is good :)

I still do not understand if this is really a security issue.
IMO if a program on your system does that, the whole system is compromised,
you can't really be hardening any software against it.

If you disagree, do you mind if we move this discussion to upstream
[nodejs] discussion group ? We'll probably find some enlightment there.

what we're talking about is a classic symlink attack.  I haven't tried
to verify it with npm myself, but using predictable tmpfile names in
world-writable directories is the usual gateway to a vulnerability here.

I'm not on the upstream nodejs discussion group, but if you want to cc
me on discussion there, i'd be happy to chime in.

A symlink attack is done by a user of a system against another user on the
same system. This is not a worry on your laptop, but may be an issue on a
bigger server in a data center

Thank you for the explanation.
Somehow I understood it was important and forwarded the bug upstream.

The security issue is fixed there :

this will eventually come to npm debian package.

Thanks for the followup on this, jérémy!

I confess i'm kind of amazed that node doesn't have any primitive like
mkstemp(3), or if it does, that npm isn't using such a primitive.

Has a CVE been requested or assigned for this yet?  I'd be happy to make
the request if you think that would be useful.

hi oss-sec folks--

i recently learned that npm, the node.js language-specific package
manager, created predictable temporary directory names in a
world-writable filesystem (/tmp) by default when unpacking archives.

It looks like this might leave open a classic symlink race such that one
user could control the location where another user unpacked packages
coming from an npm installation.

if the superuser was the one running npm, this might have led to a
non-privileged user who wins the race getting a privilege escalation as
well, depending on the contents of the fetched package.

The issue appears to have been fixed upstream today, here:

  <https://github.com/isaacs/npm/commit/f4d31693>

I first learned about the problem during a related a bug report
<http://bugs.debian.org/715325> (cc'ed here)

If you think this needs a CVE, could you assign one please?

Regards,

	--dkg

No, it's perfectly fine for npm to depend on a number of modules,
since npm tarball contains its own node_modules.
Upstream npm is relatively open to patches that separate functions in a module,
and node-temp seems well maintained.

Message-ID: <51DDBDC5.7020501@fifthhorseman.net>

Subject: npm uses predictable temporary filenames when unpacking tarballs

hi oss-sec folks--

i recently learned that npm, the node.js language-specific package
manager, created predictable temporary directory names in a
world-writable filesystem (/tmp) by default when unpacking archives.

It looks like this might leave open a classic symlink race such that one
user could control the location where another user unpacked packages
coming from an npm installation.

if the superuser was the one running npm, this might have led to a
non-privileged user who wins the race getting a privilege escalation as
well, depending on the contents of the fetched package.

The issue appears to have been fixed upstream today, here:

  <https://github.com/isaacs/npm/commit/f4d31693>

I first learned about the problem during a related a bug report
<http://bugs.debian.org/715325> (cc'ed here)

If you think this needs a CVE, could you assign one please?

Regards,

	--dkg

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=983917#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-12 09:34:15 UTC  ``` An insecure temporary directory generation / use flaw was found in the way NPM, Node.js Package Manager, used to generate location of the temporary folder to be used for tarballs expansion. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, possibly leading to their ability to overwrite arbitrary system file reachable with the privileges of the user performing the NPM archive expansion.

Thank you, T.C. To leave this open was correct (the other npm package issue case shipped within Red Hat is in progress still). We will close this bug once the flaw has been corrected in all affected package versions.
