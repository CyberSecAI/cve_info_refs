Subject: Re: CVE Request: pwgen

I've done some further analysis of the program after reading the previous
thread, and I think there needs to be CVEs and fixes for:

- When used from a non-tty passwords are trivially weak by default (first
reported by Solar Designer)
- Phonemes mode has heavy bias and is enabled by default (first reported by
Solar Designer)
- Silent fallback to insecure entropy (first reported by Jean-Michel
Vourgère) (Debian bug #672241 - tagged as "wishlist")
- Secure mode has bias towards numbers and uppercase letters

I've attached a patch that fixes most issues - it doesn't solve the bias
towards numbers, because it's caused by requiring at-least one number per
password - so in an 8 character password there'd have to be 0.1 numbers to
avoid bias.  There's an argument to be made for removing the at-least-one
rule, but if the system that password is being used with has those rules,
it doesn't fix the problem anyway.  Perhaps a separate flag for that?

The changes are:

- Print a message and abort() of there's trouble opening or reading
/dev/urandom (So apport should pick up any packages that have been using
insecure entropy)
- Make "-s" the default
- Add an argument --insecure-phonemes (or -P)
- Non-tty passwords are now as secure as tty
- Require lower-case characters be present to even out some bias
- Pull in passwdqc as a Suggests on the debian package - pwqgen can
generate sane random passphrases

I can't imagine any reasonable use-case for the non-tty defaults (except
maybe combining with espeak as an enhanced interrogation technique), and
you can be certain that there's some people out there with it embedded in a
script that's generating useless passwords.

For phonemes mode in general, the bias is extreme, there are a limited
number of possible combinations and it is generally not suitable for
security purposes.  I have some fairly detailed analysis of it, but I
believe this list has a no-exploits policy...

Regards,
  Michael

Severity: normal

pwgen uses /dev/urandom when available.

On systems that heavily use entropy, such as those with a lot of
daemons providing encrypted services, the entropy is exhausted and
pwgen silently falls back to using standard pseudo generated numbers.

While it may be suitable for most uses, it would be nice to have an
option such as --slow that will force the use of /dev/random rather than
/dev/urandom.

It looks likes what I intended to report as a wish for a --slow option
got some attention recently. See bug #726578.

I'm attaching the little script I wrote in order to understand how slow
a switch to /dev/random would make pwgen. It has a trigger displaying
available entropy when things are too long. It might help other.
Try "pwgen2 16 16" a few times in a row.

Welp I can't argue with data (well I could, but that would be silly).

Please use:

CVE-2013-4440 pwgen non-tty passwords are trivially weak by default

CVE-2013-4441 pwgen Phonemes mode has heavy bias and is enabled by default

CVE-2013-4442 pwgen Silent fallback to insecure entropy

CVE-2013-4443 pwgen Secure mode has bias towards numbers and uppercase
letters
