A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted GIF file that, when processed by gif2tiff, would cause gif2tiff to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running gif2tiff.  Proposed patch is attached. ```  ------- *Comment [#1](show_bug.cgi?id=2452#c1) From Frank Warmerdam  2013-08-14 08:59:41* ------- ``` Patch applied at head. ``` |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=996468#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-08-13 08:29:55 UTC  ``` An OOB Write was found in the LZW decompressor used in gif2tiff, a tool to convert GIF images to TIFF.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=996468#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-08-13 08:29:55 UTC  ``` An OOB Write was found in the LZW decompressor used in gif2tiff, a tool to convert GIF images to TIFF. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted GIF file that, when processed by gif2tiff, would cause gif2tiff to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running gif2tiff.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=996468#c2)  Huzaifa S.

## Synopsis

Moderate: libtiff security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0223)

## Topic

Updated libtiff packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
Image File Format (TIFF) files.

A heap-based buffer overflow and a use-after-free flaw were found in the
tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially
crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-1960, CVE-2013-4232)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker
could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could
cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2013-4231, CVE-2013-4243, CVE-2013-4244)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker
could use these flaws to create a specially crafted TIFF file that would
cause tiff2pdf to crash. (CVE-2013-1961)

Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NCI Agency for reporting
CVE-2013-1960 and CVE-2013-1961. The CVE-2013-4243 issue was discovered by
Murray McAllister of the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the
CVE-2013-4244 issue was discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

All libtiff users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications linked against libtiff must be restarted for this update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>
