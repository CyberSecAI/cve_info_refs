    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Access Control [CWE-284]"
    ],
    "impact": "Bypassing the captcha protection allows attackers to leverage automated attack vectors, such as brute-forcing login credentials, and gaining unauthorized access to the administration console.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a request with a wrong captcha code initially and then replaying multiple requests with a hardcoded valid captcha code and its verification code.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the device's web interface."
