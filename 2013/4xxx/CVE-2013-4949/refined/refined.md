Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2013-4949, as described in the exploit information for Machform Form Maker 2:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize file uploads, allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files, including executable PHP scripts. The code uses `move_uploaded_file()` to move the file to a destination directory without proper checks on the file content. The vulnerability is located in `view.php`
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of file type validation, insecure file storage mechanism. The application does not check file extensions, allowing PHP files to be uploaded and potentially executed.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to upload and execute malicious PHP code on the server, leading to complete server compromise. This includes data theft, data corruption, and the ability to perform additional attacks on other systems.
    *  **Attack Vectors**: By uploading files through a file upload form.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to find a form on the website that contains a file upload element. This can be done by brute-forcing the `id` parameter in `view.php`
    * **Technical Details:** The code snippet shows how uploaded files are moved and renamed. The file name is constructed using a mix of form element name, record ID, and the original filename from $_FILES array. The destination path is constructed in such a manner that attacker can predict it.

2.  **MySQL Injection (Error Based):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically POST data. The function `ap_sanitize_input()` does not properly prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries. User-supplied parameters are directly used in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries to retrieve sensitive data, modify data, or compromise the database server.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  By injecting malicious SQL code through the HTTP POST parameters
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to identify vulnerable POST parameters using the vulnerable `view.php` script, and provide malicious input to these parameters.
    * **Technical Details:** The exploit shows injection attempts in the `element_2` POST parameter by using a single quote `'`.

3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application is vulnerable to XSS because it does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input encoding/escaping before being displayed on the web page.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  By injecting JavaScript code through the HTTP POST parameters.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to identify vulnerable POST parameters using the vulnerable `view.php` script, and provide malicious input containing JavaScript code to these parameters.
    * **Technical Details:** The exploit shows a XSS attempt using a `<script>` tag in the `element_2` parameter.

**Summary:**

The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Machform Form Maker 2, including arbitrary file upload, SQL injection, and XSS. These vulnerabilities are due to insecure handling of user-supplied data and can be exploited to completely compromise the server and/or perform malicious actions on the application and its users.

The exploit information also includes instructions for finding forms with file upload functionality by brute-forcing the `id` parameter, which makes the system more vulnerable.
