Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The NFS server in FreeBSD incorrectly uses client-supplied credentials instead of the credentials configured in `exports(5)` when filling out the anonymous credential for an NFS export. This occurs when `-network` or `-host` restrictions are used simultaneously with `-mapall` or `-maproot` options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Privilege Validation:** The core issue lies in the improper handling of credentials for NFS exports when network/host restrictions are in place along with mapping options. The server fails to use the intended anonymous credentials defined in the `exports` configuration, instead relying on potentially privileged credentials supplied by the client.
- **Bypassed Access Checks:** The vulnerability allows a remote client to potentially bypass normal access controls by providing elevated credentials (e.g., root) which the server will incorrectly use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:**  A malicious remote client can gain unauthorized access to files on the NFS share by supplying privileged credentials during the mount process. This could lead to complete compromise of the server if the client uses a root user.
- **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** If the attacker gains elevated privileges, they can read, modify, or delete sensitive files on the NFS share.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attack occurs over the network via the NFS protocol.
- **NFS Client:** The attacker must have access to an NFS client capable of sending potentially privileged credentials during mount requests.
- **Specific Export Configuration:** The vulnerability is exploitable when the server uses `-mapall` or `-maproot` in combination with network/host restrictions (-network or -host) in the `/etc/exports` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable NFS server.
- **NFS Client Software:**  The attacker must have an NFS client that can connect to the NFS server.
- **Knowledge of NFS Export Configuration (potentially):**  While not strictly required, knowledge of the server's NFS export configuration would help the attacker understand the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in FreeBSD versions 8.3, 9.0, and 9.1.
- Patches were released to address this vulnerability, and the advisory provides methods for applying them.
- The provided svn log message mentions that the group list for a non-default export entry was being copied from the wrong place which could cause access failures, but this does not appear to be related to CVE-2013-4851. It is related to the same advisory but not the same vulnerability.
