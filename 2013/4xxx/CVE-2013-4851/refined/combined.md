FreeBSD-SA-13:08.nfsserver Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Incorrect privilege validation in the NFS server
Category: core
Module: nfsserver
Announced: 2013-07-26
Credits: Rick Macklem, Christopher Key, Tim Zingelman
Affects: FreeBSD 8.3, FreeBSD 9.0 and FreeBSD 9.1
Corrected: 2012-12-28 14:06:49 UTC (stable/9, 9.2-BETA2)
2013-07-26 22:40:23 UTC (releng/9.1, 9.1-RELEASE-p5)
2013-01-06 01:11:45 UTC (stable/8, 8.3-STABLE)
2013-07-26 22:40:29 UTC (releng/8.3, 8.3-RELEASE-p9)
CVE Name: CVE-2013-4851
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of its
file systems so that other hosts can access them over the network and mount
them as if they were on local disks. FreeBSD includes both server and client
implementations of NFS.
II. Problem Description
The kernel incorrectly uses client supplied credentials instead of the one
configured in exports(5) when filling out the anonymous credential for a
NFS export, when -network or -host restrictions are used at the same time.
III. Impact
The remote client may supply privileged credentials (e.g. the root user)
when accessing a file under the NFS share, which will bypass the normal
access checks.
IV. Workaround
Systems that do not provide the NFS service are not vulnerable. Systems that
do provide the NFS service are only vulnerable when -mapall or -maproot is
used in combination with network and/or host restrictions.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-13:08/nfsserver.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-13:08/nfsserver.patch.asc
# gpg --verify nfsserver.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/8/ r245086
releng/8.3/ r253694
stable/9/ r244772
releng/9.1/ r253693
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing XXXXXX with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cXXXXXX --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base
Or visit the following URL, replacing XXXXXX with the revision number:

| Log Message: | ``` The group list for a non-default export entry (a host/subnet one) was being copied from the wrong place. This patch fixes that. This could cause access failures for mapped users, when the group permissions were needed.  PR:		147998 Submitted by:	Christopher Key (cjk32 at cam.ac.uk) MFC after:	2 weeks   ``` |
