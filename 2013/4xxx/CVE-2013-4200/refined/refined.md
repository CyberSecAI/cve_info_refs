Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-4200:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Plone, a content management system, handles user cookie data in specific situations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522). The system does not adequately protect cookie data.
- Potential open redirect (CWE-601) and input validation issues (CWE-20), as suggested by Matthew Wilkes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking: An attacker can potentially steal a user's session by having their cookie forwarded to the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- Specially crafted URL: A remote attacker can craft a malicious URL. When a valid Plone user visits this URL, their cookie can be forwarded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL.
- The attacker needs to trick a valid Plone user into visiting this specially-crafted URL via certain browsers for cookie forwarding to occur.
