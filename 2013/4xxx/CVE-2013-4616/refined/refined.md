## CVE-2013-4616

The provided content describes a vulnerability in Apple iOS related to the generation of Personal Hotspot passwords.

**Root Cause:** The passwords generated for Personal Hotspot networks in Apple iOS had low entropy, making them predictable.

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Weak Password Generation:** iOS used a flawed algorithm for generating default Personal Hotspot passwords, resulting in passwords that could be predicted by an attacker.
*   **Limited Wordlist:** The password generation was based on a limited word list of only 1,842 entries.
*   **Skewed Frequency Distribution:** The selection of words from the word list was not random, leading to a skewed frequency distribution and making some passwords more likely to be generated than others.

**Impact:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could predict the Personal Hotspot password and gain unauthorized access to the network.
*   **Abuse of Internet Connection:** The attacker could then abuse the user's internet connection.
*   **Access to exposed services:** Access services running on a smart device disclosing personal data might be accessed via the hotspot connection and thus violating the privacy of a smart device owner.
*   **Network Attacks:** The attacker could potentially attack connected devices on the network or eavesdrop on network traffic.

**Attack Vector:**

1.  **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies iOS-based hotspot targets by their vendor-specific MAC addresses.
2.  **Handshake Capture:** The attacker captures a WPA2 handshake between a Wi-Fi-enabled device and the mobile hotspot, potentially by deauthenticating existing wireless clients to force a reauthentication.
3.  **Password Cracking:** The attacker uses a dictionary attack, optimized with the reduced word list and frequency distribution information, to crack the pre-shared key (password).

**Attacker Capabilities:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within range of the Personal Hotspot network to capture the WPA2 handshake.
*   **Network Monitoring:** The attacker needs the ability to monitor network traffic and capture the WPA2 handshake.
*   **Computational Resources:** The attacker needs sufficient computational resources (e.g., a GPU cluster) to perform the dictionary attack in a reasonable timeframe.
