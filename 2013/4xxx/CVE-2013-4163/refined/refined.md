    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `ip6_append_data_mtu` function in the IPv6 implementation of the Linux kernel did not properly maintain information about whether the `IPV6_MTU` setsockopt option had been specified when appending a second frame to a corked socket.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of `IPV6_MTU` setsockopt option.",

The github commit message provides additional technical details about the root cause, indicating that the function lost track of whether IPV6_MTU was set when handling a second frame on a corked socket. The opensuse and ubuntu security notices describe the vulnerability concisely."
