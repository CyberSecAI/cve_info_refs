  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect permission checks in the `virConnectDomainXMLToNative` API function, allowing a remote attacker with connect:read privileges to elevate to domain:write privileges. It affects libvirt versions 1.1.0 and later.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Incorrect permission checks within the `virConnectDomainXMLToNative` API function.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper access control.",
         "Inadequate privilege verification."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote user with limited `connect:read` privileges could escalate to `domain:write` privileges, allowing unauthorized modifications or control over virtual machines.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker leverages the vulnerable API function through a network connection.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs `connect:read` privileges to exploit this vulnerability. This usually means having access to the libvirt daemon and being authorized for certain read actions. The attacker needs to be able to reach the libvirt daemon over a network connection.",
        "additional_info": "The vulnerability was introduced in libvirt version 1.1.0, as it was tied to the introduction of ACL permissions. The vulnerability can also cause `libvirtd` to crash because of how XML is parsed. Patches were released to correct the vulnerability. The issue did not affect versions of libvirt shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6."
