{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SocialEngine Timeline Plugin does not properly validate uploaded file types. While it displays an error message if the uploaded file is not an image, it doesn't delete the file from the temporary directory, allowing access to it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary file upload",
    "Lack of proper file type validation",
     "Failure to remove invalidly uploaded files"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to remote command execution and potential full system compromise. The provided example demonstrates reading sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` and `install/config/auth.php`.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uploads a PHP file through the 'Change Cover' functionality of the Timeline plugin, which is intended for image uploads.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a valid user account on the SocialEngine platform and access to the user's profile page to use the 'Change Cover' option and upload the malicious file."
