CVE-2013-4474:
Root cause of vulnerability: The `pdfseparate` utility in poppler uses `snprintf` with a user-controlled destination filename argument, allowing format string specifiers to be interpreted.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Uncontrolled format string vulnerability (CWE-134)

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service (crash).
- Possibly arbitrary code execution.

Attack vectors:
- The attacker must control the arguments passed to the `pdfseparate` utility, specifically the destination filename.
- This can be exploited by supplying a malicious format string as the output filename argument, such as "%x%x%x%x%x%x%n".

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must be able to execute the `pdfseparate` utility with crafted arguments.
- The attacker may be local or remote if a web application or other service invokes `pdfseparate` with user-supplied data.
