# Poppler: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201401-21**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Poppler, allowing
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/poppler** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.24.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.24.5** |

### Background

Poppler is a cross-platform PDF rendering library originally based on
Xpdf.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Poppler. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF in
an application linked against Poppler, possibly resulting in execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service
condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/poppler-0.24.5"

```

# USN-2958-1: poppler vulnerabilities

2 May 2016

poppler could be made to crash or run programs if it opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [poppler](/security/cves?package=poppler) - PDF rendering library

## Details

It was discovered that the poppler pdfseparate tool incorrectly handled

certain filenames. A local attacker could use this issue to cause the tool

to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-4473](/security/CVE-2013-4473),

[CVE-2013-4474](/security/CVE-2013-4474))

It was discovered that poppler incorrectly parsed certain malformed PDF

documents. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

crafted PDF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2015-8868](/security/CVE-2015-8868))

We can argue about whether these things are actually "reasonable", but people will still do them, and pdfseparate probably shouldn't crash or execute arbitrary code in the meantime. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=69434#c4)  Albert Astals Cid    2013-09-25 18:52:18 UTC  ``` Well, I guess it should not be that hard to write a check that there is no other % than one %d and pairs of %%.

Subject: /usr/bin/pdfseparate: pdfseparate segfault based on filenames (possibly
exploitable)
Date: Mon, 16 Sep 2013 13:42:00 -0400
```
Package: poppler-utils
Version: 0.22.5-2
Severity: normal
File: /usr/bin/pdfseparate

utils/pdfseparate.cc appears to invoke sprintf directly on user-passed
data without cleaning or verifying it.

bool extractPages (const char *srcFileName, const char *destFileName) {
  char pathName[1024];
 /* ... */
   sprintf (pathName, destFileName, pageNo);

This means that an attacker able to control the arguments passed to
pdfseparate, and who can make one of the arguments a multipage pdf,
can probably smash the stack.

A) they could provide a srcFileName long enough to overflow pathName.
   this will write to arbitrary memory.

B) they could provide a destFileName with other sprintf placeholders
   besides %d, which would effectively be invoked while pointing to
   uninitialized memory.

easy segfault:

 pdfseparate multipage.pdf test-%s-%d.pdf

I haven't tried to turn this into an exploit, but i'm sure someone
with more time, patience, and cleverness than me could do so.

Incidentally, I looked at that code as result of your #723121, just to
check whether the development version still had that lack; I spotted
this issue too and just fixed it upstream in b8682d8 [1], which will be
part of poppler 0.24.2.
I could backport it to 0.22.x.

Would it be possible to report this upstream?
<https://bugs.freedesktop.org>, product "poppler" and component "utils".

Thanks for your reports,
