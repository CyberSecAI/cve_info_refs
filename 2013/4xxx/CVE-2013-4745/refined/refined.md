The provided content is related to CVE-2013-4745.

**CVE-2013-4745** is associated with multiple vulnerabilities found in the TYPO3 extension "myquizpoll".

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The myquizpoll extension had SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  The application was vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, potentially allowing an attacker to read, modify, or delete data from the database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application was vulnerable to XSS attacks, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL injection exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification or deletion, or other malicious activities within the database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful XSS exploitation could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or the redirection of users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  Attackers could craft malicious SQL queries and inject them through user-supplied input fields within the application.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could inject malicious scripts through user-supplied input fields or other vulnerable areas within the application. These scripts would then be executed by other users when they access the application, potentially compromising their session or machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   For **SQL Injection**, an attacker would need the ability to submit crafted requests to the server via a vulnerable input field.
*   For **XSS**, an attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious code that would be executed by another userâ€™s browser. This could be through a vulnerable user input field that is not properly sanitized or validated before being displayed to other users of the application.
