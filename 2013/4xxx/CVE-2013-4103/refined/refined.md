Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4103:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Cryptocat handled crafted `data:` URIs. Specifically, it was possible to inject and execute arbitrary scripts through manipulated data URIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Script Injection:** The core issue was the lack of proper sanitization or validation of data URIs, allowing malicious script content to be embedded and executed within the application's context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary script execution within the user's Cryptocat session, potentially allowing the attacker to steal information, manipulate communications, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Data URI:** An attacker could embed malicious JavaScript code into a data URI and send it through the chat.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send messages:**  The attacker needed to be in a position to send messages to a target user, typically within a chat session.
*   **Crafting of a Malicious Data URI:** The attacker needed to be capable of crafting a data URI that contained malicious JavaScript.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of issues identified in Cryptocat, many of which were related to cryptographic weaknesses, key generation problems, and other security flaws.
*   The provided text does not contain a full technical description of the exploitation, however, it identifies the vulnerable component and general attack vector.
