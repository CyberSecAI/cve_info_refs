{
  "CVE-2013-4114": {
    "description": "The automatic update request in Nagstamont before 0.9.10 uses a cleartext base64 format for transmission of a username and password, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network.",
    "root_cause": "Improper encoding of user credentials in HTTP requests for update information.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Credentials transmitted using base64 encoding without encryption.",
      "Exposure of credentials via HTTP Basic Authentication header"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of user credentials for servers monitored by Nagstamon, potentially granting access to the monitored systems.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to intercept network traffic.",
      "Network sniffing to capture HTTP requests."
     ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept network traffic between the Nagstamon client and the update server."
    ],
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability exists in Nagstamon versions prior to 0.9.10.",
      "Usernames and passwords are included in the HTTP Basic Auth header in base64 encoded format when checking for updates.",
      "The vulnerability is triggered when Nagstamon automatically requests update information from nagstamon.sourceforge.net.",
      "The issue is fixed in version 0.9.10 and later."
     ]
