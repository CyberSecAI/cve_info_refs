Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2013-020:
Hard-Coded Bluetooth PIN Vulnerability in LIXIL Satis Toilet

Published: 08/01/13
Version: 1.0

Vendor: LIXIL Corporation
Product: Satis
Version affected: Unknown

Product description:
The Satis is a "smart" toilet. It is controlled using LIXIL's "My Satis"
Android application, which communicates with the toilet using Bluetooth.

Finding 1: Hard-Coded Bluetooth PIN
*****Credit: Daniel Crowley of Trustwave SpiderLabs
CVE: CVE-2013-4866
CWE: CWE-259

The "My Satis" Android application has a hard-coded Bluetooth PIN of "0000"
as can be seen in the following line of decompiled code from the
application:

BluetoothDevice localBluetoothDevice =
BluetoothManager.getInstance().execPairing(paramString, "0000")

As such, any person using the "My Satis" application can control any Satis
toilet. An attacker could simply download the "My Satis" application and
use it to cause the toilet to repeatedly flush, raising the water usage and
therefore utility cost to its owner.

Attackers could cause the unit to unexpectedly open/close the lid, activate
bidet or air-dry functions, causing discomfort or distress to user.

Vendor Response:
No response received.

Remediation Steps:
No patch currently exists for this issue.

Revision History:
06/14/13 - Attempt to contact vendor
07/10/13 - Attempt to contact vendor
07/12/13 - Attempt to contact  vendor
08/01/13 - Advisory published

In the latest messy development from the world of hacking, an information security firm has warned that a hi-tech Japanese toilet is vulnerable. What could possibly go wrong?

The £4,000 Satis loo, made by Lixil, is so advanced that users may control it with a mobile phone app (it ought to be called crAPPr but Lixil went with “My Satis”) that can activate functions including a bidet spray, motorised seat and music player.

The problem, warns the US company Trustwave, is that loos have the same pin number, which cannot be changed, allowing anyone with the app to control any nearby Satis toilet.

“Attackers could cause the unit to unexpectedly open the lid, activate bidet or air-dry functions, causing discomfort or distress to the user,” it said.

It’s hard to imagine any reason to hack a loo other than as part of some messy prank, but the rise of wirelessly controlled devices is presenting real and even deadly threats.

Barnaby Jack, a hacker who sought to expose security flaws in such gadgets, was due to demonstrate this month how a pacemaker could be hacked to increase heart rates to fatal levels from 50 feet away (think that episode of Homeland).

But Jack, who had previously hacked cash machines and said that defibrillators and insulin pumps were also vulnerable, was found dead in a San Francisco apartment last month. A cause of death has not yet been established, while conspiracy theories rage.

Equally alarmingly, researchers at the University of Texas have shown how ships or even military drones that rely on GPS navigation systems can be hacked and then steered without raising alarms using low-cost equipment.

Information security firm Trustwave has reported a potential cyber-attack vector to a device you may have never expected the phrase "security vulnerability" would be applied (other than in reference to the end of a toilet paper roll, that is). In an [advisory issued August 1](https://www.trustwave.com/spiderlabs/advisories/TWSL2013-020.txt), Trustwave warned of a Bluetooth security vulnerability in [Inax's Satis automatic toilet](http://www.inax-usa.com/technology/satis/).

Functions of the Satis—including the raising and lowering of its lid and operation of its bidet and flushing nozzles—can be remotely controlled from an Android application called "My Satis" over a Bluetooth connection. But the Bluetooth PIN to pair with the toilet—"0000"—is hard-coded into the app. "As such, any person using the 'My Satis' application can control any Satis toilet," the security advisory noted. "An attacker could simply download the 'My Satis' application and use it to cause the toilet to repeatedly flush, raising the water usage and therefore utility cost to its owner. Attackers could cause the unit to unexpectedly open/close the lid, [or] activate bidet or air-dry functions, causing discomfort or distress to user."

And you thought the only thing you had to worry about was dropping your phone into the toilet.

# 'Genius Toilet' Can Be Hacked, Can Attack You On The Loo (VIDEO)

'Genius Toilet' Can Be Hacked, Can Attack You On The LooHuffington Post UK05/08/2013 05:58am BST

What's the worst thing that can happen to you on the toilet? Slip and fall? Miss the bowl? Underestimate the spiciness of the curry you had last night?

How about an impromptu high-pressure session of colonic irrigation?

Unfortunately this is no longer the preserve of a very niche sub-genre of horror movie but an actual and terrifying reality.

**This could be you...**

Last year a [Japanese company unveiled the Genius Toilet](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/satis-bluetooth-toilet-japan-lixil-smartphone_n_2322012). a domestic point of relief like no other that can be controlled by your smartphone.

Users can flush, clean, raise, lower or heat the toilet seat, or even play your favourite toilet tunes through the built-in speakers, all via a bluetooth app called My Satis.

Only now a rather worrying vulnerability has been exposed by a [security company called Trustwave Holdings.](https://www.trustwave.com/spiderlabs/advisories/TWSL2013-020.txt)

Simply put, anyone with the My Satis app can control any Genius Toilet by entering the default pin of '0000'.

Trustwave state: "Attackers could cause the unit to unexpectedly open/close the lid, activate bidet or air-dry functions, causing discomfort or distress to user."

You're not safe. Anywhere.
