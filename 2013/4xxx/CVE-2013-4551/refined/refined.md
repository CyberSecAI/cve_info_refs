Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-4551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks in the emulation paths for VMLAUNCH and VMRESUME instructions when nested virtualization is enabled in Xen. Specifically, the hypervisor attempts to use internal state that is not properly set up unless nested virtualization is actively used by a guest.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Permission Checks:** The core issue is that permission checks were deferred too late in the process for the emulation paths of VMX instructions (VMLAUNCH and VMRESUME).
*   **Uninitialized Internal State:** The hypervisor attempts to access internal state that is not initialized unless nested virtualization is explicitly enabled for a guest. This leads to a crash when a guest attempts to execute these instructions without the required setup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Host Crash:** A malicious or misbehaving HVM guest can trigger a host crash by executing VMLAUNCH or VMRESUME instructions through nested virtualization. This includes malicious code running within a guest OS.
*   **Denial of Service:** By crashing the host, an attacker can cause a denial of service, disrupting services provided by the Xen hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HVM Guest:** The primary attack vector is a malicious HVM guest operating on VMX (Intel) hardware. The guest needs to execute the VMLAUNCH or VMRESUME instruction.
*   **Nested Virtualization:** The vulnerability can only be exploited when nested virtualization is *not* enabled on the target hypervisor.
*   **User Mode Code:**  The vulnerability can be exploited via malicious user-mode code running within the guest operating system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to run a HVM guest:** The attacker must be able to run a malicious HVM guest on a Xen hypervisor.
*   **VMX Hardware:** The underlying hardware must be VMX (Intel) capable.
*   **Execution of VMX instructions:** The attacker needs to be able to execute VMX instructions, specifically VMLAUNCH or VMRESUME, either directly from within the guest or indirectly via nested virtualization paths.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Xen 4.2.x and later, but not 4.1.x and earlier.
*   The issue can be avoided by running only PV guests or running HVM guests on SVM (AMD) hardware.
*  Enabling nested virtualization for a HVM guest on VMX hardware also avoids the issue. However, this functionality is experimental.
