Subject: Xen Security Advisory 75 (CVE-2013-4551) - Host crash due to
 guest VMX instruction execution

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-4551 / XSA-75
                              version 2

           Host crash due to guest VMX instruction execution

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

This issue has been assigned CVE-2013-4551.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Permission checks on the emulation paths (intended for guests using
nested virtualization) for VMLAUNCH and VMRESUME were deferred too
much.  The hypervisor would try to use internal state which is not set
up unless nested virtualization is actually enabled for a guest.

IMPACT
======

A malicious or misbehaved HVM guest, including malicious or misbehaved user
mode code run in the guest, might be able to crash the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.2.x and later are vulnerable.
Xen 4.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.

Only HVM guests run on VMX capable (e.g. Intel) hardware can take
advantage of this vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests, or running HVM guests on SVM capable
(e.g. AMD) hardware will avoid this issue.

Enabling nested virtualization for a HVM guest running on VMX capable
hardware would also allow avoiding the issue.  However this
functionality is still considered experimental, and is not covered by
security support from the Xen Project security team.  This approach is
therefore not recommended for use in production.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jeff Zimmerman.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

This issue was disclosed publicly on the xen-devel mailing list.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
