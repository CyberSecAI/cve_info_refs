  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2013-4221",
    "description": "Restlet applications which use ObjectRepresentation to map HTTP request data directly to an object deserialize arbitrary user-provided XML using XMLDecoder. It was found that XMLDecoder deserialized an attacker-provided definition of a class and executed its methods. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code execution in the context of the server running the Restlet application.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the insecure deserialization of XML data using XMLDecoder in Restlet applications. When ObjectRepresentation is used to map HTTP request data directly to an object, the application deserializes arbitrary user-provided XML, which allows an attacker to inject malicious XML that defines a class and its methods, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Use of XMLDecoder without proper sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can achieve arbitrary remote code execution on the server running the vulnerable Restlet application, leading to a full compromise of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted XML payload in the HTTP request to a Restlet application that uses ObjectRepresentation to handle the request data."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Restlet application.",
       "The attacker must have knowledge of how to craft malicious XML payloads that can be deserialized by XMLDecoder to execute arbitrary code."
    ],
    "remediation": "The vulnerability was addressed in Restlet 2.1.4 by disabling the vulnerable use cases. Red Hat also provided patches in RHSA-2013:1410 and RHSA-2013:1862."
