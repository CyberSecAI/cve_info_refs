  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability lies in how Keystone's memcache and KVS token backends handle PKI token revocation. Instead of storing the token ID in the revocation list, the entire token was stored, causing comparisons to fail and revoked tokens to remain valid.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is that the Keystone memcache and KVS token backends were storing the entire PKI token in the revocation list, instead of storing just the token ID (hash).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect token revocation list implementation: The revocation list stored the entire token, making comparisons with hashed token IDs fail.",
        "Lack of proper validation/comparison: The auth_token middleware searched for the hashed token ID in the revocation list, but the memcache/KVS backend were storing the entire tokens."
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that revoked PKI tokens could still be considered valid, allowing users with revoked tokens to retain unauthorized access to resources.",
        "attack_vectors": [
         "An attacker with a valid, but later revoked, PKI token could continue to use that token to access resources, bypassing intended access restrictions."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have obtained a valid PKI token initially. The attacker could be an external or internal user that was previously authorized and their access should have been revoked.",
       "additional_information": "This vulnerability affects Keystone setups using PKI tokens with the memcache or KVS token backends in Folsom and Grizzly versions. Havana setups, setups using UUID tokens, or setups using PKI tokens with the SQL token backend are not affected. The vulnerability was also present in master branch (which became Havana), where the token ID was already being hashed when added to the revocation list. Although master branch was not vulnerable, a patch was still made to include 'expires' attribute into the revocation list as it is expected by the API."
