{
  "cve": "CVE-2013-4416",
  "description": "The Ocaml xenstored implementation (\"oxenstored\") cannot correctly handle a message reply larger than XENSTORE_PAYLOAD_SIZE when communicating with a client domain via the shared ring mechanism. When this situation occurs the connection to the client domain will be shutdown and cannot be restarted leading to a denial of service to that domain.",
  "affected_systems": "All systems using oxenstored are potentially vulnerable. oxenstored was added in Xen 4.1.0. From Xen 4.2.0 onward it is used by default if an ocaml toolstack was present at build time.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ocaml xenstored implementation mishandles oversized message replies.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of message replies larger than XENSTORE_PAYLOAD_SIZE."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service against a client domain. If the victim domain is a toolstack or control domain then this can lead to a denial of service against the whole system.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious domain can create a directory containing a large number of entries in the hopes that a victim domain will attempt to list the contents of that directory. If this happens then the victim domain's xenstore connection will be shutdown."
  },
  "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious domain is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must create a directory with a large number of entries such that a listing of this directory would exceed XENSTORE_PAYLOAD_SIZE."
