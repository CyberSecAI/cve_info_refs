Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-4156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of unknown XML elements during the parsing of OOXML (Office Open XML) document files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that the software mishandles certain XML elements, which leads to memory corruption. This indicates a lack of proper input validation and memory management when processing OOXML documents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  Specially crafted documents can be used to trigger a denial-of-service attack, which suggests a potential for crashing or hanging the application due to the memory corruption issues.
- **Possible Further Exploits:** The content mentions that further exploits are possible but have not been verified. This suggests that the memory corruption could potentially be leveraged for other malicious activities like arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves using specially crafted OOXML documents. These documents would contain malicious XML elements designed to trigger the memory corruption during parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and deliver malicious OOXML documents to the victim. This could be achieved via email attachments, downloads, or other methods of file distribution.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network. The attack relies on the victim opening the malicious file.

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache OpenOffice versions 3.4.0 and 3.4.1 on all platforms are confirmed to be affected.
- Earlier versions of OpenOffice.org might also be vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- Users are advised to upgrade to Apache OpenOffice 4.0 or later.
- If an upgrade is not immediately possible, users should exercise caution when opening documents from untrusted sources.
