Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4361:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the emulation of the `fbld` instruction within the Xen hypervisor. This instruction is used during I/O emulation.
*   The emulation code uses an incorrect variable for the source effective address. Instead of the intended address, it uses an uninitialized bit pattern from the hypervisor's stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak. Because the `fbld` instruction emulation uses an address from the stack which was never initialized, the instruction reads data from the stack.
*   **Incorrect Memory Access:** The emulation logic incorrectly accesses memory, leading to the read of unintended memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Hypervisor Stack Exposure:** A malicious guest operating system (OS) can potentially read contents of the hypervisor's stack, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.
*   **Potential Access to Sensitive Data:** The leaked stack data could contain sensitive information, potentially including data related to other guest VMs or the hypervisor itself.
*   **Note:** The exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the specific values present on the hypervisor stack, which might be challenging to predict or manipulate.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HVM Guest:** The attack can only be performed from within a Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) guest OS.
*   **`fbld` Instruction:** The malicious guest must trigger the emulation of the `fbld` instruction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **HVM Guest Access:** The attacker needs to have control over an HVM guest OS running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
*   **Ability to Execute Instructions:** The attacker must be able to execute arbitrary code within the guest OS to trigger the `fbld` instruction and observe the results of the incorrect memory access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Mitigation:** Running only paravirtualized (PV) guests avoids this issue. No mitigation is available for HVM guests without patching.
*   **Difficulty:** The advisory states that exploitation of this vulnerability would likely require significant research due to the unpredictability of the stack data being leaked.

In summary, CVE-2013-4361 is an information leak vulnerability in Xen's `fbld` instruction emulation. By triggering the `fbld` instruction within a malicious HVM guest, an attacker could potentially read hypervisor stack data, which may contain sensitive information.
