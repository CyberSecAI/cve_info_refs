Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A use-after-free vulnerability exists in lighttpd when the File Alteration Monitor (FAM) stat cache engine is enabled. This occurs specifically when `FAMMonitorDirectory` fails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The vulnerability arises because, upon failure of `FAMMonitorDirectory`, the memory allocated for storing context information is deallocated but subsequently, the code attempts to read a `version` component within that deallocated memory. Although the invalid data read may not cause direct issues, the memory access itself can lead to a segmentation fault.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote client can trigger the vulnerability by causing a failure in `FAMMonitorDirectory`. Repeated triggers could cause the lighttpd server to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Client Trigger:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote client interacting with the webserver.
*   **File System Dependent:** The ability to cause a `FAMMonitorDirectory` failure seems to be dependent on the file system in use.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send requests to the web server.
*   **FAM Enabled:** The lighttpd server must have the "fam" stat cache engine enabled (`server.stat-cache-engine = "fam"`).
*   **Specific File System/Paths:** The attacker needs to interact with directories that cause `FAMMonitorDirectory` to fail.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability was identified using a clang static analyzer, which suggests that the vulnerability was present in the source code and detectable through static code analysis.
* The fix is available in lighttpd version 1.4.33
* A patch is available: `http://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd-1.4.33_fix_fam_use_after_free.patch`
