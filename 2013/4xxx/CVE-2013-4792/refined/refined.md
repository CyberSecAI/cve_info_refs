The content is related to CVE-2013-4792.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The logout functionality of PrestaShop does not have CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The logout functionality is performed via a GET request without any token or other mechanism to prevent CSRF.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can force a logged-in user to logout by tricking them into visiting a malicious link or website, or by embedding the crafted URL on a webpage, for example in an image tag.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted URL that triggers the logout functionality of PrestaShop. The attacker can embed this URL in a website, email, or any other method that can trick a user to trigger the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to make a logged-in PrestaShop user (especially an administrator) to trigger a crafted GET request to log them out. This can be accomplished through social engineering, by embedding the malicious GET request in a malicious page.
