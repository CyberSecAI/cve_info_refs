Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `lighttpd` web server did not properly check the return values of the `setuid()`, `setgid()`, and `setgroups()` system calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Error Handling:** The core issue is the absence of checks after attempting to change user and group IDs. If these calls fail for any reason (e.g., resource limits, or other system issues), the `lighttpd` process would continue to run with its original privileges (typically root).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation if `setuid()`, `setgid()`, or `setgroups()` calls fail, as the process would remain running as root instead of dropping to a lower-privilege user as intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Root Access:** If `lighttpd` fails to drop privileges, it could run with root privileges, granting an attacker the ability to execute commands with root access.
*   **CGI Script Execution as Root:** If the lighttpd process is running as root, any CGI scripts executed through it would also run with root privileges, potentially allowing an attacker to compromise the entire system.
*   **System Compromise:**  The ability to execute arbitrary code as root can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker could exhaust system resources (e.g., by creating a large number of processes with the same UID) to cause `setuid()` or similar calls to fail.
*  **CGI Script Manipulation:** A malicious actor might be able to create or modify CGI scripts, and if a lighttpd restart happens while the server is still running as root due to the vulnerability, those scripts would run with root privileges as well.
*   **Remote Exploitation:**  It's mentioned that remote users might trigger many processes and then trigger a restart using a different bug in lighttpd, which would cause lighttpd to continue running as root due to this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to trigger a restart:** Either through a separate vulnerability in lighttpd, or through having some degree of control over the server (being able to trigger restarts), the attacker needs to be able to cause the server to restart while conditions exist that will cause the setuid/setgid calls to fail.
*   **Ability to execute processes:** An attacker needs to be able to execute processes with the same UID as the target user, which might be possible with write access to CGI scripts.
*   **System Knowledge:** An attacker would need to know of the vulnerability and how to exploit it or be able to cause the conditions where it would be exploited.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using the `clang` static analyzer.
*   The fix for this involves adding error checking around the `setuid()`, `setgid()`, and `setgroups()` calls, and handling failures gracefully.
*   The fix was included in lighttpd version 1.4.33, and the patch is available for manual application.
*   The provided information details affected products as openSUSE 13.1, 12.3 and 12.2. It also affects Debian oldstable (squeeze), stable (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions.
*   A related vulnerability exists in Contec's SolarView Compact product due to its usage of an older, vulnerable lighttpd version.
