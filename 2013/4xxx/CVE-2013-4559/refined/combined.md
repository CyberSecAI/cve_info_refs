An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
- added cve-2013-4508.patch and
cve-2013-4508-regression-bug729480.patch: (bnc#849059)
When defining an ssl.cipher-list, it works for the
'default' HTTPS setup ($SERVER["socket"] 443 block), but
when you utilize SNI ($HTTP["host"] blocks within the
$SERVER["socket"] block) the ssl.cipher-list seems to not
inherit into the host blocks and instead will default to
include all of the available openssl ciphers (except SSL
v2/v3 based if those are disabled)
- added cve-2013-4559.patch (bnc#850468) check success of
setuid,setgid,setgroups
- added cve-2013-4560.patch (bnc#850469) FAM: fix use after

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2795-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Michael Gilbert

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : lighttpd
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4508 CVE-2013-4559 CVE-2013-4560
Debian Bug     : 729453

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the lighttpd web server.

CVE-2013-4508

    It was discovered that lighttpd uses weak ssl ciphers when SNI (Server
    Name Indication) is enabled.  This issue was solved by ensuring that
    stronger ssl ciphers are used when SNI is selected.

CVE-2013-4559

    The clang static analyzer was used to discover privilege escalation
    issues due to missing checks around lighttpd's setuid, setgid, and
    setgroups calls.  Those are now appropriately checked.

CVE-2013-4560

    The clang static analyzer was used to discover a use-after-free issue
    when the FAM stat cache engine is enabled, which is now fixed.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.4.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.31-4+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version lighttpd_1.4.33-1+nmu1.

We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

 setuid/setgid/setgroups return values not checked
===================================================
CVE-2013-4559 [1] was assigned to this bug.
Description
-------------
Privilege escalation from lighttpd user ("www-data").
This bug was found with the clang static analyzer.
Attack scenario
-----------------
In certain cases setuid() and similar can fail; if an environment limits
the number of processes a user can have, setuid() might fail if the target
uid already is at the limit.
A user who can execute processes with the same userid (for example by
having write access to CGI scripts) could clone() often; in this case
a lighttpd restart would end up with lighttpd running as root, and the
CGI scripts would run as root too.
It could be possible that remote users could trigger many processes too, and
trigger a restart using a different bug in lighttpd.
Affected versions
-------------------
All versions before 1.4.33.
Patch
-------
See http://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd-1.4.33\_fix\_setuid.patch
Fixed in
----------
1.4.x: http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/repository/revisions/2923
1.4.34: not released yet (http://www.lighttpd.net/)
Solutions or workaround
-------------------------
Make sure setuid()/setgid()/... can never fail:
\* don't have any limits, or
\* disable mod\_cgi (perhaps using fcgi-cgi [3] or scgi-cgi [4] as replacement),
and run any backends (FastCGI, SCGI, ...) with different users.
Privilege separation is always a good idea!
Other restrictions could be in place (AppArmor/SELinux), but they usually
either always work or never work.
