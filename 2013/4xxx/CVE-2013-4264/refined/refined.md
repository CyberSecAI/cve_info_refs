Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-4264:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance**

The provided content directly references CVE-2013-4264 and its associated commit in FFmpeg. The openwall content also indicates that this CVE was assigned to address a specific issue.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability**

The root cause is an out-of-bounds write in the `kempf_decode_tile()` function within the `libavcodec/g2meet.c` file of FFmpeg. This occurs due to insufficient checks on the source pointer (`src`) when decoding a tile, potentially writing beyond the allocated memory.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**

-   **Out-of-bounds write**: The vulnerability lies in the `kempf_decode_tile` function where the code attempts to access memory locations pointed to by `src` without verifying if `src` remains within the bounds of the input buffer. This write goes beyond allocated memory, leading to memory corruption.

**4. Impact of exploitation**

-   **Memory Corruption**: Writing outside of allocated memory can corrupt other data structures, leading to unpredictable behavior.
-   **Potential for Code Execution**: While not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds writes can sometimes be leveraged by an attacker to overwrite critical parts of memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
-   **Denial of Service**: The memory corruption could lead to a crash, causing a denial of service.

**5. Attack vectors**

-   **Malicious Input File**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting specially crafted G2M (Go2Meeting) encoded video files that trigger the out-of-bounds write condition when decoded by FFmpeg.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position**

-   **Ability to provide a malicious file**: An attacker would need the ability to provide or trick a user into processing a specially crafted malicious file using FFmpeg that would trigger the vulnerability. No special network position or server-side access is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Function:** `kempf_decode_tile` in `libavcodec/g2meet.c`
*   **Issue:** Lack of sufficient checks on the source pointer (`src`) before reading data. Specifically, the code increments the `src` pointer based on the decoded tile size, but fails to verify if it remains within the bounds of the input data.
*   **Fix:** The commit linked in the Github content addresses this by adding a check to ensure that the `src` pointer does not go beyond the end of the buffer `(src_end)`.

This fix prevents the out-of-bounds read, thus correcting the issue.
