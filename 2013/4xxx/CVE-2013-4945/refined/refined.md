The provided content relates to CVE-2013-4945.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities is improper input sanitization and validation within the BMC Service Desk Express application. This leads to SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** Several parameters within the application are vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the following cookies are vulnerable:
    *   `ASPSESSIONIDASSRATTQ`
    *   `TABLE_WIDGET_1`
    *   `TABLE_WIDGET_2`
    *   `browserDateTimeInfo`
    *  `browserNumberInfo`
   Also, the `UID` parameter in `/SDE/login.aspx` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
2.  **Reflected XSS:**  Several parameters are vulnerable to reflected XSS
     *  `SelTab` parameter in `/SDE/QV_admin.aspx`
     *  `CallBack` parameter in `/SDE/QV_grid.aspx`
     * `HelpPage` parameter in `/SDE/commonhelp.aspx`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data within the database, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  The attack vector for SQL injection involves sending crafted HTTP requests containing malicious SQL code within the specified vulnerable parameters through cookies, or the `UID` parameter in the login page
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameters, which is then reflected back to the user's browser and executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable BMC Service Desk Express application.
*   The attacker does not need to have prior authentication, as the vulnerable parameters are in login page or cookies.
*  For the XSS vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to entice a user to click a malicious link or visit a compromised website that will send the attacker's crafted request to the vulnerable application.
