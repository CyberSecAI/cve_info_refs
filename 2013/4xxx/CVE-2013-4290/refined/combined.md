# [seth.arnold () canonical com: CVE Requests openjpeg]

---

*From*: Seth Arnold <seth.arnold () canonical com>

*Date*: Wed, 11 Sep 2013 19:19:50 -0700

```
Please find attached three mails relating to the openjpeg
(<http://www.openjpeg.org/>) libopenjpeg library (Debian/Ubuntu source
package name openjpeg) JPEG 2000 image processing library.

CVE-2013-4289 has been assigned for heap-based buffer overflows.
CVE-2013-4290 has been assigned for stack-based buffer overflows.

When I reviewed our packages, I followed several of the memory-allocation
multiplications far enough to convince myself that integer wraparound
was possible, though perhaps the example I selected for the CVE request
is not an actual problem.

I have also attached an email I sent directly to the openjpeg developers
with suggestions for further enhancements that did not feel worty of a CVE
request. I'm including it here in the hopes that it is useful to someone.

I did not receive any replies from the openjpeg developers; as far as I
know, no patches are available, and I personally will not be taking the
time to prepare patches.

If someone does take the time to prepare patches, I'd like to suggest
writing several wrappers around malloc() to handle the common memory
allocation cases so the size validation can be performed in a handful of
routines rather than scattered through the codebase.

Thanks to Huzaifa Sidhpurwala for his assistence deciphering my request.

Thanks,
Seth

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
