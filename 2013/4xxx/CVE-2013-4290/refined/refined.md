The provided content relates to CVE-2013-4290.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an incorrect use of `sprintf()` which can overflow a stack-based buffer. Specifically, the code uses `sprintf` with the format specifier `%f` to convert a double value to a string, and then concatenates this string to a buffer using `strcat`. The buffer allocated for `sprintf` is too small, and a large enough floating-point number will cause a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to the usage of `sprintf` with insufficient buffer size when formatting floating-point numbers.
- The code uses a fixed-size buffer `tmp[16]` to store the result of `sprintf(tmp, "%f", value)`. The %f format specifier can produce output larger than this, especially when formatting large floating point numbers, such as DBL_MAX, which can require 317 characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can overwrite parts of the stack leading to potential control over the execution flow of the program.
- This could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in the processing of image data within the `openjpeg` library.
- Specifically, when handling float values during event logging.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file that contains specific data values that will cause the `sprintf` function to write beyond the bounds of the buffer, or use command line parameters that result in this overflow.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be local but can exploit this through a web-based image processing mechanism where user-supplied data could be used in the sprintf operation.
