Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-4508:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how lighttpd handles SSL cipher lists when Server Name Indication (SNI) is used.  Specifically, the `ssl.cipher-list` option configured in the main server block (e.g., `$SERVER["socket"] == ":443"`) was not being inherited by the SNI-specific host blocks (e.g., `$HTTP["Host"] == "example.com"`). This resulted in the SNI virtual hosts using the OpenSSL default cipher list, which includes weaker, potentially vulnerable ciphers, instead of the intended, stronger cipher list specified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Cipher List Inheritance:**  The primary weakness is the failure to inherit the `ssl.cipher-list` from the main server block to SNI host blocks.
*   **Use of Default Ciphers:** The fallback to OpenSSL's default cipher list introduces the use of weaker cipher suites, which may be susceptible to various attacks.
*   **SNI Context Bypass:** The configuration options `ssl.engine`, `ssl.cipher-list`, `ssl.honor-cipher-order`, `ssl.empty-fragments`, `ssl.use-sslv2`, `ssl.use-sslv3`, `ssl.dh-file`, and `ssl.ec-curve` were only applied when binding SSL sockets, not in the SNI context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by:

*   **Downgrading Connection Security:** Forcing connections to use weak ciphers, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Compromising Confidentiality:** Decrypting traffic due to the use of weak ciphers, exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic Manipulation:** An attacker intercepts or initiates network traffic to a lighttpd server utilizing SNI.
*   **Exploitation of Weak Ciphers:** Once the vulnerable cipher is negotiated, attackers leverage weaknesses to compromise the connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable lighttpd server.
*   **Awareness of Vulnerable Hostnames:** The attacker needs to know a vulnerable hostname (one configured using SNI) that is served by the lighttpd server.
*  **Passive or active attacker:**  An attacker could be passive (eavesdropping) or active (man-in-the-middle).

**Additional Details from the Content:**
* The vulnerability affects lighttpd versions from 1.4.24 up to and including 1.4.33.
* A patch is available which fixes this issue.
* Workarounds include explicitly setting `ssl.cipher-list` in every block where `ssl.pemfile` is set.
* OpenSSL does not re-verify sessions on resumption, which can lead to a bypass of `ssl.verifyclient.enforce`
* Dynamic client verification needs to be used to check `ssl.verifyclient.username` or `ssl.verifyclient.exportcert`.
