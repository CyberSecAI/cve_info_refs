Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-4933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `netmon_open` function in `wiretap/netmon.c` within the Netmon file parser of Wireshark has a memory allocation issue. Specifically, it does not properly allocate memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Memory Allocation:** The core issue lies in how memory is handled when opening a Netmon file. The `netmon_open` function does not allocate memory correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a malicious packet trace file. This will lead to an application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Packet Trace File:** The vulnerability is triggered when Wireshark opens a specially crafted Netmon packet trace file.
*   **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by convincing a user to open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malformed Netmon packet trace file.
*   **Social Engineering (or similar):** The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to open the malicious file in Wireshark. The attacker doesn't need a specific network position if they can deliver the file to the user through other means, like email.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is related to but distinct from CVE-2013-4934, which is also a crash in the Netmon file parser.
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.8.x before 1.8.9 and 1.10.x before 1.10.1.
*   Patches have been issued by various vendors, including Debian, openSUSE, Red Hat, and Gentoo, addressing the vulnerability by updating to versions 1.8.9 or 1.10.1 or later.
