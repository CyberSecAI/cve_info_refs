| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-11-15 20:23:51 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  Perdition, the IMAP and POP proxy server, fails to apply the administrator's specified ciphersuite preferences when making outbound connections to IMAP and POP servers using STARTTLS.  For these outbound connections, it applies the administrator's listening ciphersuite preferences, which in many cases may be significantly weaker.  This was first noted publicly on the debian BTS:    <http://bugs.debian.org/729028>  All versions of perdition up to 2.0 appear to be affected, and the fix is a one-line patch.  This is not a critical vulnerability (it can be mitigated, for example, by enforcing a strict minimalist ciphersuite on the backend server), but in the absence of any such mitigation, it may cause the connections between the proxy server and the backend server to negotiate a weaker ciphersuite than the administrator's stated intent.   @maintainer(s): since the package has never been marked as stable, we don't need to stabilize it. Please remove the affected versions from the tree. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-03-05 08:37:27 UTC  ``` # Aaron Bauman <bman@gentoo.org> (05 Mar 2016) # Per security [bug #491372](show_bug.cgi?id=491372 "RESOLVED FIXED - net-mail/perdition : ssl_outgoing_ciphers not applied to STARTTLS connections") this package is vulnerable # and unmaintained.  Removal in 30 days. net-mail/perdition ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-04-01 03:05:31 UTC  ``` Removed:  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=f4eb7ab719dd1041628d72be14ff5571cb29b27b> ``` |  |

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Perdition(8) says:

        --ssl_outgoing_ciphers STRING:

              Cipher list when making outgoing SSL or TLS connections as
              per ciphers(1). If empty ("") then openssl's default will
              be used.  (default "")

However, this is only the case for outgoing connections that do not use
STARTTLS (the perdition terminology is confusing here, since what it
calls "TLS" actually means "start as cleartext, negotiate to encrypted
via STARTTLS" and what it calls "SSL" actually means "start SSL or TLS
session, run service inside that").

Here's the fix:

-		      opt.ssl_ca_path, opt.ssl_listen_ciphers, servername);
+		      opt.ssl_ca_path, opt.ssl_outgoing_ciphers, servername);
       if(!server_io) {
         VANESSA_LOGGER_DEBUG("perdition_ssl_connection outgoing");
         VANESSA_LOGGER_ERR("Fatal error establishing SSL connection");

This is a security concern because it means that perdition is not
obeying the specifications of the administrator, and may accept weaker
ciphersuites than instructed on its backhaul connections.

Consider the case where an administrator wants to offer relatively
promiscuous IMAP connections to their end users -- if the user's MUA
only has some weak cipher suite or cleartext IMAP, we want to accept the
weak ciphersuite as better than nothing.  However, the admin's backend
IMAP servers are all under her control, and she knows that they are
capable of stronger ciphersuites.  in this case, ssl_listen_ciphers will
allow weak ciphers, and ssl_outgoing_ciphers will be strict and require
high security, to at least protect the link between perdition and the
backend IMAP server.

However, if this outgoing connection happens to use IMAP+STARTTLS
instead of IMAPS, the bug described here will offer weak ciphersuites to
the backend IMAP server.

All versions of perdition in debian currently have this flaw.  I've
reported it to the upstream mailing list, but for whatever reason the
message hasn't cleared that mailing list yet.

Regards,

         --dkg

Hi Daniel,

thanks for bringing this to my attention and sorry
for not noticing the mailing list post: I'm not suer what happened there.

I think that the best thing to do is both:
* Update the Debian packages with this fix and;
* Release a fresh upstream version of perdition with this fix.

dunno if you care to investigate the mailing list situation further.  if
you do, the post to the mailing list was Message-ID:
<87zjpfwqft.fsf@alice.fifthhorseman.net>

The handoff to the vergenet MX looked like this from my side:

The message doesn't seem to have made it through to the pipermail

This sounds like a reasonable approach to me.  I'm cc'ing the security
team so that they're aware of the problem and the potential security-fix
upload(s).  Would you like me to request a CVE for tracking this issue,
or do you intend to request one yourself?

Regards,

        --dkg

PS While i've got your ear, can i get you to look at and reply to my
earlier post to perdition-users about DHE?

If you could request one that would be great.

[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=729028;msg=29) (text/plain, inline)]

```
Perdition, the IMAP and POP proxy server, fails to apply the
administrator's specified ciphersuite preferences when making outbound
connections to IMAP and POP servers using STARTTLS.  For these outbound
connections, it applies the administrator's listening ciphersuite
preferences, which in many cases may be significantly weaker.

This was first noted publicly on the debian BTS:

  <http://bugs.debian.org/729028>

All versions of perdition up to 2.0 appear to be affected, and the fix
is a one-line patch.

This is not a critical vulnerability (it can be mitigated, for example,
by enforcing a strict minimalist ciphersuite on the backend server), but
in the absence of any such mitigation, it may cause the connections
between the proxy server and the backend server to negotiate a weaker
ciphersuite than the administrator's stated intent.

Could a CVE be issued for this issue?

Thanks,

	--dkg

   * Fix for [CVE-2013-4584](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4584)
 .
     Perdition fails to apply the administrator's specified ciphersuite
     preferences when making outbound connections to IMAP and POP servers
     using STARTTLS.  For these outbound connections, it applies the
     administrator's listening ciphersuite preferences, which in many cases
     may be significantly weaker.
 .
     This is not a critical vulnerability (it can be mitigated, for example,
     by enforcing a strict minimalist ciphersuite on the backend server),
     but in the absence of any such mitigation, it may cause the connections
     between the proxy server and the backend server to negotiate a weaker
     ciphersuite than the administrator's stated intent.
 .

Use specified ciphers for outgoing STARTLS connections

```
Perdition(8) says:

        --ssl_outgoing_ciphers STRING:

              Cipher list when making outgoing SSL or TLS connections as
              per ciphers(1). If empty ("") then openssl's default will
              be used.  (default "")

However, this is only the case for outgoing connections that do not use
STARTTLS (the perdition terminology is confusing here, since what it
calls "TLS" actually means "start as cleartext, negotiate to encrypted
via STARTTLS" and what it calls "SSL" actually means "start SSL or TLS
session, run service inside that").

This is a security concern because it means that perdition is not
obeying the specifications of the administrator, and may accept weaker
ciphersuites than instructed on its backhaul connections.

Consider the case where an administrator wants to offer relatively
promiscuous IMAP connections to their end users -- if the user's MUA
only has some weak cipher suite or cleartext IMAP, we want to accept the
weak ciphersuite as better than nothing.  However, the admin's backend
IMAP servers are all under her control, and she knows that they are
capable of stronger ciphersuites.  in this case, ssl_listen_ciphers will
allow weak ciphers, and ssl_outgoing_ciphers will be strict and require
high security, to at least protect the link between perdition and the
backend IMAP server.

However, if this outgoing connection happens to use IMAP+STARTTLS
instead of IMAPS, the bug described here will offer weak ciphersuites to
the backend IMAP server.

This is [CVE-2013-4584](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6rm7-87pc-2jw9 "CVE-2013-4584")
This is Debian Bug #729028

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

### [CVEProject/cve-schema](/CVEProject/cve-schema)[Support PURL as identifier](/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/173)

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.
