Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of AES-CTR mode in Cryptocat's multiparty encryption scheme. Specifically, the same nonce (a counter value) was being reused for different messages encrypted with the same key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Nonce Reuse in AES-CTR:** The core issue is the failure to generate unique nonces for each message encrypted with AES-CTR. Reusing nonces with the same key in CTR mode completely breaks the security.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Plaintext Traffic Disclosure:** An attacker who intercepts encrypted traffic can, due to nonce reuse, decrypt the messages. Specifically, if an attacker has two messages encrypted with the same key and nonce, they can XOR the two ciphertexts to reveal the XOR of the two plaintexts. In many cases, this will reveal a large amount of information. If they have one of the plaintexts they can recover the other one, which is common in chat protocols, where participants may send the same information to many other participants (e.g., a user name or a message).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between Cryptocat users. This could be a man-in-the-middle attack, a compromised network element, or access to stored captured traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Sniffing:**  The attacker must have the ability to capture network traffic of Cryptocat users.
*   **Cryptographic Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the AES-CTR mode of operation and its vulnerability to nonce reuse.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content from tobtu.com provides much more detail about the vulnerability than the CVE description, particularly how the nonce reuse was part of a larger set of cryptographic implementation issues with Cryptocat.
*   The tobtu.com content indicates that this issue, along with others, was fixed in later versions of Cryptocat (2.1.12 or later).
*  The tobtu.com content explains that ECDSA in group chat was also vulnerable due to a bug in BigInt library that made bits predictable when generating random numbers used in DSA and ECDSA. The problem affected DSA in one-to-one OTR chat and ECDSA in group chat.  This issue is mentioned as a separate vulnerability in the openwall.com content and assigned the CVE-2013-4104.
