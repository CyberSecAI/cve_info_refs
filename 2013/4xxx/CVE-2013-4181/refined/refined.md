    "Metadata": {
      "References": [
        "https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2013-4181.html",
        "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013%3A1210",

      ],
      "Description": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. An attacker could construct a carefully-crafted URL, which once visited by an unsuspecting user, could cause the user's web browser to execute malicious script in the context of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager domain."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The `addAlert` method in the `RedirectServlet` generates an HTML page with a JavaScript alert. The content of the request is included in the generated message without proper sanitization. Specifically, single quotes are replaced with double quotes, but the `</script>` tag is not filtered or escaped.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
       "Impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the user's browser, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure within the context of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager domain.",
      "Attack Vectors": "A remote attacker could craft a malicious URL. When a user visits this URL, the malicious script embedded in the URL would be executed in the user's browser.",
      "Required Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to construct and deliver a crafted URL to a user of the affected system. No authentication is needed to access the `RedirectServlet`."
