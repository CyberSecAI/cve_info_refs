Enable repo of 3.2.2 5. Try to upgrade: upgrade successful, No prompt on "no rollback is available"   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=999224#c4)  Yedidyah Bar David    2013-09-02 06:08:54 UTC  ``` Hi Cheryn and all,  I would not like to continue the "Change Doc text game", so I'll explain in longer words what this change does, and let you decide about the phrasing for the Doc Text.  When running engine-upgrade, the script checks if there are new updated RPMs. If there are, it also checks if the existing, already-installed, packages, can still be installed from the configured yum repos. If they are not, it alerts the user, and refuses to continue, unless ran with the option '--no-yum-rollback'. All of this is done on startup, in preparation for a potential failure, and not on the failure itself - if there is a failure after updating to the new RPMs, it simply tries to downgrade.  This change fixes the above check. Without it, on certain conditions, it was possible that while checking the script would think that it will be able to downgrade to the currently-installed RPMs, while in practice it could not, and if there was a failure and it would try to downgrade, the downgrade will fail.  The current Doc Text is completely accurate if we put the parenthesis in a less natural position:  "engine-upgrade now warns users when (packages cannot be rolled back to a currently installed version if an upgrade fails)."  The natural position is: "(engine-upgrade now warns users when packages cannot be rolled back to a currently installed version) if an upgrade fails." and is wrong.  I am not a native English speaker and so might be wrong.  Best regards!   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=999224#c5)  Cheryn Tan    2013-09-02 07:29:12 UTC  ``` Thank you for your detailed corrections, Yedidyah and Alon. Spoke with Didi on IRC earlier and I think the new note now accurately describes the bug.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=999224#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-09-10 19:08:11 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1210)

## Topic

Updated rhevm packages that fix one security issue and various bugs are now
available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a centralized management
platform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual
machines. The Manager provides a comprehensive range of features including
search capabilities, resource management, live migrations, and virtual
infrastructure provisioning.

The Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several
interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and
interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a
Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface
(API).

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager. An attacker could construct a carefully-crafted
URL, which once visited by an unsuspecting user, could cause the user's web
browser to execute malicious script in the context of the Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager domain. (CVE-2013-4181)

Red Hat would like to thank Kayhan KAYIHAN of Endersys A.Ş. for reporting
this issue.

A list of the bugs fixed in this update is available in the Technical Notes
document:

<https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.2/html/Technical_Notes/chap-RHSA-2013-1210.html>

All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages, which resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

Further information on upgrading the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Manager is available in the Installation Guide:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=988774#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-26 10:38:40 UTC  ``` A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the RedirectServlet of the oVirt Engine and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager (RHEV-M). A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted link, that when visited by an unsuspecting RHEV-M / oVirt user would lead to arbitrary script execution in the context of the RHEV-M / oVirt domain.  Access to the RedirectServlet does not require authentication.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=988774#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2013-07-26 11:18:56 UTC  ``` This problem is in the addAlert method of the RedirectServlet:  <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine.git;a=blob;f=backend/manager/modules/root/src/main/java/org/ovirt/engine/core/redirect/RedirectServlet.java;h=f6e79f0;hb=HEAD#l61>  This method generates an HTML page with JavaScript alert used to display error message to the user.  Generated message includes content from the request.  This content is not properly sanitized - single quotes are replaced by double quotes to protect against certain attacks, however, </script> does not get filtered or escaped properly.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=988774#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-26 14:41:57 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Kayhan KAYIHAN of Endersys A.Ş. for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=988774#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-09-10 19:05:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV Manager version 3.2  Via RHSA-2013:1210 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1210.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=991542#c0)  Chris Pelland    2013-08-02 17:12:46 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #970889](show_bug.cgi?id=970889 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - [LSM] engine: disk remains in locked state with repeating error in engine log when vm's pid is suddenly killed") +++  Description of problem:  This happened to me in my setup and I found a way to reproduce it.  a vm crashed during syncImageData and engine started reporting the following in a loop while vm disk remained in image locked:   2013-06-05 10:12:03,564 ERROR [org.ovirt.engine.core.vdsbroker.ResourceManager] (pool-4-thread-49) [5ab1c721] CreateCommand failed: org.ovirt.engine.core.common.errors.VdcBLLException: VdcBLLException: Vds with id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 was not found  I found a way to reproduce this 100% which is to kill -9 the vm pid during syncImageData.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  sf17.4  How reproducible:  100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. on a two hosts cluster with multiple iscsi storage create a vm with one disk 2. run the vm 3. when the vm changes status to up live storage migrate the disk 4. during syncImageData step, kill -9 the vm's pid   Actual results:  1. engine shows the following error in the logs in a loop:   2013-06-05 10:12:03,564 ERROR [org.ovirt.engine.core.vdsbroker.ResourceManager] (pool-4-thread-49) [5ab1c721] CreateCommand failed: org.ovirt.engine.core.common.errors.VdcBLLException: VdcBLLException: Vds with id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 was not found  2. vm's disk remains in image locked until we run unlock_entity script.

Adding recent logs from my setup, and marking as high priority as this is a scenario that can very well happen, and the system does not seem to have a way to automatically recover.  --- Additional comment from Allon Mureinik on 2013-07-09 11:15:20 EDT ---    --- Additional comment from Allon Mureinik on 2013-07-30 10:44:04 EDT ---   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=991542#c2)  Aharon Canan    2013-08-26 12:51:36 UTC  ``` Verified using sf20  Error appears in logs but only once,  Disk became available and didn't remain locked (after few minutes)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=991542#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-09-10 19:05:39 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
