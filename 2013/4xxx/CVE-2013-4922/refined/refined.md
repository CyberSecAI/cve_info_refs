Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4922:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The DCOM ISystemActivator dissector in Wireshark contains a flaw that can lead to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A malformed DCOM packet processed by the ISystemActivator dissector can trigger a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by providing a malformed packet trace file to be opened by Wireshark.
- This constitutes a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability as it makes the application unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **Network Injection:** Attacker injects a crafted, malformed DCOM packet onto the network where Wireshark is capturing traffic.
-  **Malicious Capture File:** Attacker provides a user with a malicious pcap trace file containing the specially crafted packet that will trigger a crash when opened in Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to inject packets into the network being monitored by Wireshark or to convince a user to open a malicious capture file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Laurent Butti.
- Wireshark version 1.10.0 is affected; version 1.10.1 and later are not.
