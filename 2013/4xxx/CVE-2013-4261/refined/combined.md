Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-026
CVE: CVE-2013-4261
Date: September 12, 2013
Title: Potential denial of service on Nova when using Qpid
Reporter: Jaroslav Henner (Red Hat)
Products: Nova
Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:
Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova when using
Apache Qpid as the RPC backend. By sending any random text longer than
65K characters to an instance console and requesting the console log
contents through the API, an authenticated user may disrupt the
nova-compute node his instance is running on. This vulnerability could
be leveraged in a Denial of Service attack against the cloud provider.
Only Folsom and Grizzly setups using Qpid as their RPC backend are
affected. Havana setups, or setups using other RPC backends (like
RabbitMQ), are all unaffected.

Grizzly fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/43303/>

Folsom fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/45426/>

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

### Bug Description

Reported publicly by Jaroslav Henner at: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=999164>

for some sequence of characters in the console-log, nova console-log displays:

ERROR: The server has either erred or is incapable of performing the requested operation. (HTTP 500)

When console-log is ran often enough, it seems to be causeing death of nova-compute.

This specific failure looks qpid specific, but I think we should probably be filtering to only printable characters for all transports. I will take a look at this ASAP.

I was debugging this issue and found out it is an instance of [bug 1175808](/bugs/1175808) only in grizzly. See <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=999164#c6>

I'll propose the full backport of the patch in [bug 1175808](/bugs/1175808) to grizzly which fixes the issue.

@Xavier: so havana (master) is unaffected ? What about Folsom (not sure QPID support existed back then...) ?

@Mikal: are you taking the OSSA task too ? (i.e. draft the impact description and communicate it around once all fixes are merged ?)

Yes, the problem only appears in grizzly (and probably folsom) where the qpid implementation wasn't updated to send messages bigger than 65KB

An easy way to reproduce it is as follows:

1. Start a new instance

2. From inside the instance fill the console log (/dev/ttyS0) with as much text as possible (to make the log bigger than 65KB)

3. Ask for the full console-log (either from novaclient or horizon), which should fail with a 500 - InternalError

  - repeat #3 for at least "rpc\_conn\_pool\_size" times until the call hangs.

4. nova-compute has no more connections in the pool and cannot be accessed

Proposed impact description:

"""

Title: Potential denial of service on Nova when using Qpid

Reporter: Jaroslav Henner (Red Hat)

Products: Nova

Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:

Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova when using Apache Qpid as the RPC backend. By sending malicious characters to an instance console and requesting the console log contents through the API, an authenticated user may disrupt the nova-compute node his instance is running on. This vulnerability could be leveraged in a Denial of Service attack against the cloud provider. Only Folsom and Grizzly setups using Qpid as their RPC backend are affected. Havana setups, or setups using other RPC backends (like RabbitMQ), are all unaffected.

Trick question: are Cinder and Neutron (which also have the option to use Qpid as their rpc backend) vulnerable to the same DoS issue ? Or are they protected because they don't have an equivalent of nova console-log ?

@Xavier: could you have a look at the impact description and check it makes sense ? Also if you have the answer to the trick question in comment 10...

@Thierry: I would only replace the part saying "malicious characters" with something like "any random text longer than 65K characters".

w.r.t. comment 10, I guess there shouldn't be a problem in other projects while we don't send user generated content like the console log but I should double check this as I am not familiar with cinder and neutron internals.

New impact description:

"""

Title: Potential denial of service on Nova when using Qpid

Reporter: Jaroslav Henner (Red Hat)

Products: Nova

Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:

Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova when using Apache Qpid as the RPC backend. By sending any random text longer than 65K characters to an instance console and requesting the console log contents through the API, an authenticated user may disrupt the nova-compute node his instance is running on. This vulnerability could be leveraged in a Denial of Service attack against the cloud provider. Only Folsom and Grizzly setups using Qpid as their RPC backend are affected. Havana setups, or setups using other RPC backends (like RabbitMQ), are all unaffected.

"""

I'll try to get Cinder/neutron folks to look into the issue and confirm if they are affected.

Fix problem when sending long messages in Qpid

Qpid has a limitation where it cannot serialize a dict containing a

    string greater than 65535 characters. This change alters the Qpid

    implementation to JSON encode the dict before sending it, but only if

    Qpid would fail to serialize it. This maintains as much backward

    compatibility as possible, though long messages will still fail if they

    are sent to an older receiver.

The first part of this fix was ported to Grizzly in I8b6c5734b to allow

    receiving messages from Havana using the new format. Even though this

    change will modify the message format, it will only do it when messages

    are longer than 65K which would be broken anyway and could cause serious

    bugs like the one linked below.

Fixes [bug 1215091](/bugs/1215091)

The other two are just the patches to oslo-incubator.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

### Bug Description

Reported publicly by Jaroslav Henner at: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=999164>

for some sequence of characters in the console-log, nova console-log displays:

ERROR: The server has either erred or is incapable of performing the requested operation. (HTTP 500)

When console-log is ran often enough, it seems to be causeing death of nova-compute.

This specific failure looks qpid specific, but I think we should probably be filtering to only printable characters for all transports. I will take a look at this ASAP.

I was debugging this issue and found out it is an instance of [bug 1175808](/bugs/1175808) only in grizzly. See <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=999164#c6>

I'll propose the full backport of the patch in [bug 1175808](/bugs/1175808) to grizzly which fixes the issue.

@Mikal: are you taking the OSSA task too ? (i.e. draft the impact description and communicate it around once all fixes are merged ?)

Yes, the problem only appears in grizzly (and probably folsom) where the qpid implementation wasn't updated to send messages bigger than 65KB

An easy way to reproduce it is as follows:

1. Start a new instance

2. From inside the instance fill the console log (/dev/ttyS0) with as much text as possible (to make the log bigger than 65KB)

3. Ask for the full console-log (either from novaclient or horizon), which should fail with a 500 - InternalError

  - repeat #3 for at least "rpc\_conn\_pool\_size" times until the call hangs.

4. nova-compute has no more connections in the pool and cannot be accessed

Title: Potential denial of service on Nova when using Qpid

Reporter: Jaroslav Henner (Red Hat)

Products: Nova

Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:

Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova when using Apache Qpid as the RPC backend. By sending malicious characters to an instance console and requesting the console log contents through the API, an authenticated user may disrupt the nova-compute node his instance is running on. This vulnerability could be leveraged in a Denial of Service attack against the cloud provider. Only Folsom and Grizzly setups using Qpid as their RPC backend are affected. Havana setups, or setups using other RPC backends (like RabbitMQ), are all unaffected.

Trick question: are Cinder and Neutron (which also have the option to use Qpid as their rpc backend) vulnerable to the same DoS issue ? Or are they protected because they don't have an equivalent of nova console-log ?

@Thierry: I would only replace the part saying "malicious characters" with something like "any random text longer than 65K characters".

w.r.t. comment 10, I guess there shouldn't be a problem in other projects while we don't send user generated content like the console log but I should double check this as I am not familiar with cinder and neutron internals.

This vulnerability could be leveraged in a Denial of Service attack against the cloud provider. Only Folsom and Grizzly setups using Qpid as their RPC backend are affected. Havana setups, or setups using other RPC backends (like RabbitMQ), are all unaffected.
"""
I'll try to get Cinder/neutron folks to look into the issue and confirm if they are affected.

Fix problem when sending long messages in Qpid

Qpid has a limitation where it cannot serialize a dict containing a

    string greater than 65535 characters. This change alters the Qpid

    implementation to JSON encode the dict before sending it, but only if

    Qpid would fail to serialize it. This maintains as much backward

    compatibility as possible, though long messages will still fail if they

    are sent to an older receiver.

The first part of this fix was ported to Grizzly in I8b6c5734b to allow

    receiving messages from Havana using the new format. Even though this

    change will modify the message format, it will only do it when messages

    are longer than 65K which would be broken anyway and could cause serious

    bugs like the one linked below.

Fixes [bug 1215091](/bugs/1215091)

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/45426/> (for folsom) and <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/43303/> (for grizzly)

The other two are just the patches to oslo-incubator.

### Bug Description

Reported publicly by Jaroslav Henner at: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=999164>

for some sequence of characters in the console-log, nova console-log displays:

ERROR: The server has either erred or is incapable of performing the requested operation. (HTTP 500)

When console-log is ran often enough, it seems to be causeing death of nova-compute.

This specific failure looks qpid specific, but I think we should probably be filtering to only printable characters for all transports. I will take a look at this ASAP.

I was debugging this issue and found out it is an instance of [bug 1175808](/bugs/1175808) only in grizzly. See <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=999164#c6>

I'll propose the full backport of the patch in [bug 1175808](/bugs/1175808) to grizzly which fixes the issue.

@Xavier: so havana (master) is unaffected ? What about Folsom (not sure QPID support existed back then...) ?

@Mikal: are you taking the OSSA task too ? (i.e. draft the impact description and communicate it around once all fixes are merged ?)

Yes, the problem only appears in grizzly (and probably folsom) where the qpid implementation wasn't updated to send messages bigger than 65KB

An easy way to reproduce it is as follows:

1. Start a new instance

2. From inside the instance fill the console log (/dev/ttyS0) with as much text as possible (to make the log bigger than 65KB)

3. Ask for the full console-log (either from novaclient or horizon), which should fail with a 500 - InternalError

  - repeat #3 for at least "rpc\_conn\_pool\_size" times until the call hangs.

4. nova-compute has no more connections in the pool and cannot be accessed

Proposed impact description:

"""

Title: Potential denial of service on Nova when using Qpid

Reporter: Jaroslav Henner (Red Hat)

Products: Nova

Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:

Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova when using Apache Qpid as the RPC backend. By sending malicious characters to an instance console and requesting the console log contents through the API, an authenticated user may disrupt the nova-compute node his instance is running on. This vulnerability could be leveraged in a Denial of Service attack against the cloud provider. Only Folsom and Grizzly setups using Qpid as their RPC backend are affected. Havana setups, or setups using other RPC backends (like RabbitMQ), are all unaffected.

Trick question: are Cinder and Neutron (which also have the option to use Qpid as their rpc backend) vulnerable to the same DoS issue ? Or are they protected because they don't have an equivalent of nova console-log ?

@Thierry: I would only replace the part saying "malicious characters" with something like "any random text longer than 65K characters".

w.r.t. comment 10, I guess there shouldn't be a problem in other projects while we don't send user generated content like the console log but I should double check this as I am not familiar with cinder and neutron internals.

Fix problem when sending long messages in Qpid

Qpid has a limitation where it cannot serialize a dict containing a

    string greater than 65535 characters. This change alters the Qpid

    implementation to JSON encode the dict before sending it, but only if

    Qpid would fail to serialize it. This maintains as much backward

    compatibility as possible, though long messages will still fail if they

    are sent to an older receiver.

The first part of this fix was ported to Grizzly in I8b6c5734b to allow

    receiving messages from Havana using the new format. Even though this

    change will modify the message format, it will only do it when messages

    are longer than 65K which would be broken anyway and could cause serious

    bugs like the one linked below.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=999164#c0)  Jaroslav Henner    2013-08-20 20:33:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 788640](attachment.cgi?id=788640 "api.log") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=788640&action=edit "api.log") api.log  Description of problem: for some sequence of characters in the console-log, nova console-log displays: ERROR: The server has either erred or is incapable of performing the requested operation. (HTTP 500) (Request-ID: req-49673c01-2765-4942-b1ad-6cc79b520b4d)  When console-log is ran often enough, it seems to be causeing death of nova-compute.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openstack-nova-compute-2013.1.3-1.el6ost.noarch openstack-nova-api-2013.1.3-1.el6ost.noarch  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. on guest: cat > test.py <<EOF for a in range(9525, 0, -1):     print u'%d %s' % (a, unichr(a)) EOF python test.py > /dev/ttyS0 2. anywhere: nova console-log foo --lengt 9522 | head -n 3   9520 ? 9519 ? 9518 ?  nova console-log foo --lengt 9523 | head -n 3  ERROR: The server has either erred or is incapable of performing the requested operation. (HTTP 500) (Request-ID: req-5a7f4f6c-7a10-45c8-9579-cc353de1b5b3)   Actual results: Error in log, error on CLI  Expected results: no error  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=999164#c2)  Jaroslav Henner    2013-08-20 20:47:49 UTC  ``` After trying several times: nova console-log foo --lengt 9523 | head -n 3 & nova-compute died: [root@controller ~]# nova-manage service list 2> /dev/null  | grep XXX nova-compute     master-01.rhos... nova             enabled    XXX   2013-08-20 20:41:40  marking urgent because this can be used to DOS attack. This is also why I am setting Security keyword.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=999164#c3)  Jaroslav Henner    2013-08-20 20:59:15 UTC  ``` another approach how to stochastically trigger this would be: cat /dev/urandom > /dev/ttyS0 performed on the guest  It looks like the --length parameter must be > 255 in order to trigger the bug.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=999164#c6)  Xavier Queralt    2013-08-21 14:58:32 UTC  ``` I've been able to narrow down the cause of this bug.  Apparently it has nothing to do with the unicode characters but with the length of the message being sent (an instance of [bug #962557](show_bug.cgi?id=962557 "CLOSED ERRATA - Issue with 65k message limit in qpid")).  If you check the traceback in the log you can see that it crashes while encoding the length of the string (65540 bytes) as a 16 bit uint. I imagine that by using unicode characters you managed to increase the size of log up to that limit.  In Grizzly, the fix for supporting >65K messages in qpid (<https://review.openstack.org/31689>) was half ported to prevent changing the message format in an stable release but still being able to receive messages in the new format if they come from havana.  We have two options here, either we decrease MAX_CONSOLE_BYTES in libvirt driver to prevent this issue or, we fully backport the fix from master (<https://review.openstack.org/31689>) to grizzly.  On the other hand, the second issue you detected here is that when there is an error in the messaging layer while cleaning the connection it is never moved back to the connection_pool, causing the component to become unresponsive after rpc_conn_pool_size (30 by default) failures because there is no more connections in the pool.   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1199)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix multiple security issues and
various bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (Nova), which
provides services for provisioning, managing, and using virtual machine
instances.

It was found that the fixes for CVE-2013-1664 and CVE-2013-1665, released
via RHSA-2013:0657, did not fully correct the issues in the Extensible
Markup Language (XML) parser used by Nova. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to a Nova API, causing
Nova to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory, or possibly crash.
(CVE-2013-4179)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Nova handled network source
security group policy updates. An authenticated user could send a large
number of server creation operations, causing nova-network to become
unresponsive. (CVE-2013-4185)

An information disclosure flaw and a resource limit bypass were found in
the way Nova handled virtual hardware templates (flavors). These allowed
tenants to show and boot other tenants' flavors and bypass resource limits
enforced via the os-flavor-access:is\_public property. (CVE-2013-2256)

It was discovered that, in some configurations, certain messages in
console-log could cause nova-compute to become unresponsive, resulting in a
denial of service. (CVE-2013-4261)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
CVE-2013-2256 and CVE-2013-4185. Upstream acknowledges hzrandd from NetEase
as the original reporter of CVE-2013-2256, and Vishvananda Ishaya
from Nebula as the original reporter of CVE-2013-4185. Upstream also
acknowledges Ken'ichi Ohmichi from NEC for providing a corrected fix for
CVE-2013-2256.

The CVE-2013-4179 issue was discovered by Grant Murphy of the Red Hat
Product Security Team, and CVE-2013-4261 was discovered by Jaroslav Henner
of Red Hat.

This update also fixes a number of bugs in openstack-nova.

Additionally, openstack-nova has been rebased to the latest stable release
2013.1.3. (BZ#993100)

All users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the running Nova services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>
