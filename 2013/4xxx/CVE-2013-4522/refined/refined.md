Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4522:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability was caused by incorrect HTTP headers being sent for secured resources. Specifically, these headers allowed downstream caching of sensitive content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect HTTP headers:** The server was not setting appropriate caching-related headers for secured resources.
- **Downstream caching:** This lack of proper headers led to the possibility of sensitive data being cached by intermediary systems like proxy servers or browser caches.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** If sensitive data were improperly cached, unauthorized users could potentially gain access to it through cached copies.
- **Severity/Risk:** The risk is classified as "Minor," suggesting that while sensitive information could be disclosed, the impact was not considered critical.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network traffic interception:** An attacker positioned to intercept network traffic (e.g., on a shared network) or with access to a caching proxy could potentially obtain cached sensitive content.
- **Browser cache exploitation:** Access to a user's machine could allow for the viewing of cached sensitive content in browser history.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to access the cached resources, such as a proxy server or having access to the client's browser cache, or be able to intercept network traffic between the server and the client.

**Affected versions:**
- Moodle versions 2.5 to 2.5.2, 2.4 to 2.4.6, 2.3 to 2.3.9 and earlier unsupported versions.

**Fixed versions:**
- Moodle versions 2.6, 2.5.3, 2.4.7 and 2.3.10.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Tony Levi.
- The related issue numbers are MDL-38743 and MDL-42686.
- The fix involved adding "private cache headers".
