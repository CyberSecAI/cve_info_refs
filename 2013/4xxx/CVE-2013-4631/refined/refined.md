- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient checking of information copy during the parsing and processing of SNMPv3 messages can lead to a stack overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow vulnerability when handling malformed SNMPv3 messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the vulnerable equipment.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malformed SNMPv3 messages to a vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - SNMPv3 must be enabled on the target device.
    - The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable device.
