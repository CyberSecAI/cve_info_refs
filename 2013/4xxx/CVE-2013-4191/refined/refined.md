Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control enforcement within the zip archive generation functionality of Plone. Specifically, the system fails to properly verify user permissions when creating zip archives, which can lead to unauthorized access of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The system does not correctly enforce access control privileges when generating zip archives.
- **Information Exposure:** This vulnerability allows the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users.
- **CWE-200:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
- **CWE-284:** Improper Access Control
- **CWE-285:** Improper Authorization

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to generate a zip archive containing content that they would not normally have access to.
- This could expose sensitive information to unauthorized individuals.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to generate a zip archive through the vulnerable Plone application.
- This can be done remotely, which highlights the serious nature of the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- They can be a remote attacker.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the zip archive generation functionality to create an archive.

**Summary**
The vulnerability in Plone's zip archive generation functionality (zip.py) allows a remote attacker to bypass access controls and obtain sensitive information by creating a zip archive containing content they shouldn't have access to. This information exposure is due to the system not correctly enforcing access control privileges during zip archive creation.
