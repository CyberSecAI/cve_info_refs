This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in Zanata. Each vulnerability is assigned a security impact rating on a four-point scale (low, moderate, important and critical). The versions that are affected by each vulnerability are also listed.

## [CRITICAL] [CVE-2015-0279](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2015-0279) RichFaces: Remote Command Execution via insufficient EL parameter sanitization

### Description

Remote attackers can inject EL (Expression Language) via "do" parameter. This leads to remote Java method execution vulnerability. The fix for this issue prevents processing of expressions containing parentheses.

### Affected versions

3.0.0-3.6.1

### Patch commit(s)

<https://github.com/zanata/zanata-server/commit/f7988dee4db5826e93cb4b6af09a4af8dd0777b6>

## [CRITICAL] [CVE-2013-2165](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-2165) JBoss RichFaces: Remote code execution due to insecure deserialization

### Description

A flaw was found in the way RichFaces ResourceBuilderImpl handled deserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending on the deserialization logic of these classes. The fix for this issue introduces a whitelist to limit classes that can be deserialized by RichFaces.

### Affected versions

3.0.0-3.1.2

### Patch commit(s)

<https://github.com/zanata/zanata-server/commit/fe0c9cac69da2420eb749d7d23437db78fab81da>

## [CRITICAL] [CVE-2013-4486](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-4486) Zanata: Remote code execution due to EL interpolation in logging

### Description

Seam logging evaluates expression language (EL) statements in log messages. If an application includes user-provided strings in log messages directly via string concatenation, then a remote attacker could inject EL statements directly into the log messages, which would be evaluated on the server. If debug logging is enabled, Zanata performs logging of user-supplied strings using string concatenation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application server running Zanata.

### Affected versions

3.0.0-3.1.2

### Patch commit(s)

<https://github.com/zanata/zanata-server/commit/c4152ef90609367c870618aee8d49c302619cc40>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1025131#c0)  David Jorm    2013-10-31 05:18:21 UTC  ``` Seam logging evaluates expression language (EL) statements in log messages. If an application includes user-provided strings in log messages directly via string concatenation, then a remote attacker could inject EL statements directly into the log messages, which would be evaluated on the server. If debug logging is enabled, Zanata performs logging of user-supplied strings using string concatenation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application server running Zanata.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1025131#c2)  David Jorm    2014-03-21 04:51:16 UTC  ``` Upstream advisory:  <https://github.com/zanata/zanata-server/wiki/Security-advisories>  Upstream patch commit:  <https://github.com/zanata/zanata-server/commit/c4152ef90609367c870618aee8d49c302619cc40>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1025131#c3)  David Jorm    2014-03-21 04:52:42 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not Vulnerable. Zanata is not shipped in any supported Red Hat products.   ``` |  |
