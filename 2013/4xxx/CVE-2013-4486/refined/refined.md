Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-4486:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way Seam logging handles Expression Language (EL) statements within log messages.
- Zanata, when debug logging is enabled, directly concatenates user-supplied strings into log messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **EL Injection:**  The application's logging mechanism evaluates EL expressions within log messages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious EL code via user-supplied strings.
- **Insecure Logging:**  The application directly includes user-provided data into log messages through string concatenation without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting specially crafted EL statements, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the Zanata application.
- The code executes within the context of the application server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **User-Provided Input:**  The attack vector involves injecting malicious EL expressions through user-supplied strings that are incorporated into log messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Zanata application.
- **Ability to Provide Input:**  The attacker must be able to provide input to the application that will be included in the log messages. This input is then used to inject the malicious EL.
- **Debug Logging Enabled:** The vulnerability is triggered when debug logging is enabled on the Zanata application.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is rated as **CRITICAL**.
- Affected versions are Zanata 3.0.0-3.1.2.
- The fix involves ensuring user-supplied strings are not evaluated as EL expressions during logging.
- The patch commit is  <https://github.com/zanata/zanata-server/commit/c4152ef90609367c870618aee8d49c302619cc40>
