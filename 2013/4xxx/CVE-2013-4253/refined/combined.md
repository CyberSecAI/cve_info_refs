# Openshift Extras - Unofficial tools for use with OpenShift

This repository contains "odds and ends" for use with OpenShift servers
that we hope will prove useful, but are not a supported part of the
product (or, not yet).

The "master" branch is intended for use with current OpenShift Origin or
OpenShift Online servers. "enterprise-" branches are intended for use with
the corresponding OpenShift Enterprise version servers.

There were a few vulnerabilities with these scripts discovered by the Red Hat
Security Team. They were addressed in this repository on the date the CVEs
were filed. We believe the chance of these being exploited is vanishingly
small but we would like users of these scripts to be aware nonetheless:

* [CVE-2013-4253](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4253).
* [CVE-2013-4281](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4281).

Subject: Re: CVE-2014-0234 Installer: OpenShift Enterprise: openshift.sh default password creation

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

>> 3. The CVE IDs in 1 and 2 can't be the same.

> ?

There are different default-password problems that seem to have been
fixed at substantially different times, and this would often require
separate CVEs.

The issue reported in
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/29/4> apparently
included a default password of mooo. Use of mooo apparently stopped
after
<https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/commit/e7e53d296787e674859c1a06db93fcf9d98173b4>
(September 2013).

Commits such as
<https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/commit/4339020c62e43fa16f2145d46636f7dc0e26327f>
suggest that other default-password issues were fixed in 2014,
apparently including password, marionette, mongopass, OSEnterprise,
and changeme.

To have one CVE for everything, you'd need a situation similar to:

   1. one version released by Red Hat was based on code such as
      <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/e4c285f52fa93ed4626837d0436943717f85843a/enterprise/install-scripts/generic/openshift.sh>
      which has both the mooo issue and other default-password issues

   2. the next version released by Red Hat fixed the mooo issue and
      the other default-password issues

Is that what you mean, i.e., no release had a partial fix?

(The reason this question originally came up is that the wording in
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1097008> is "the optional
installer also did this." You've now clarified that the reason for
those MONGO_PASSWORD= lines in broker.conf is that the product was
installed by this optional installer. However, a need for multiple
CVEs is still possible, as reflected in the question above.)

Finally, are any of the CVEs duplicates of CVE-2013-4253 or
CVE-2013-4281? Those two CVE IDs are mentioned at
<https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/master/README.md>
but the only attempted documentation seems to be links to nonexistent
access.redhat.com URLs, and the two CVE IDs don't seem to be in
Aliases fields in Red Hat Bugzilla.

# Openshift Extras - Unofficial tools for use with OpenShift

This repository contains "odds and ends" for use with OpenShift servers
that we hope will prove useful, but are not a supported part of the
product (or, not yet).

The "master" branch is intended for use with current OpenShift Origin or
OpenShift Online servers. "enterprise-" branches are intended for use with
the corresponding OpenShift Enterprise version servers.

## Contributing

Contributions via pull request are welcome and may be included under the
same license as below.

## Security Notice

There were a few vulnerabilities with these scripts discovered by the Red Hat
Security Team. They were addressed in this repository on the date the CVEs
were filed. We believe the chance of these being exploited is vanishingly
small but we would like users of these scripts to be aware nonetheless:

* [CVE-2013-4253](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4253).
* [CVE-2013-4281](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4281).
