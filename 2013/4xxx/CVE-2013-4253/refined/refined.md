Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of default, hardcoded passwords within the `openshift.sh` scripts found in the `openshift-extras` repository.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Passwords:** The scripts contained default passwords, such as "mooo", "password", "marionette", "mongopass", "OSEnterprise", and "changeme". These were used during the installation process of OpenShift Enterprise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with knowledge of the default passwords could potentially gain unauthorized access to the system by using these default credentials. This could lead to full compromise of the targeted OpenShift instance.
*   **Data Breach:** Exploitation of the vulnerability could expose sensitive data stored within the OpenShift environment.
*   **System Takeover:** Attackers could potentially use the gained access to control and manipulate the compromised systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to a system using the vulnerable `openshift.sh` script could attempt to use the known default passwords for authentication.
*   **Compromised Installation:** If the vulnerable script was used to deploy an OpenShift instance, the instance would have these default credentials and therefore be vulnerable to remote attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Default Passwords:** The attacker needs to be aware of the default passwords used by the vulnerable scripts.
*   **Network Accessibility:**  The attacker needs to have network access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in the repository by changing these passwords, which happened around September 2013 and later in 2014 for other passwords.
*   The provided links to access.redhat.com in the github README are broken.
* The `openshift-extras` repository is described as containing "odds and ends" and is explicitly noted as not being a supported part of the Red Hat product.
