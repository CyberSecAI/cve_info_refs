Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a cron job script (`/etc/cron.minutely/openshift-facts`) in `openshift-origin-msg-node-mcollective` that was writing its output to a temporary file `/tmp/facts.log`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The script was creating a temporary log file in `/tmp`, which is a shared directory. This is insecure because it could potentially allow a malicious user to tamper with the log file or create a symlink to another file.
- **Information Leakage:** While not explicitly stated, writing to a log file in a publicly accessible directory could expose information that is not meant to be public.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Tampering or Modification of Log File:** An attacker could potentially modify the content of `/tmp/facts.log`
- **Potential Information Exposure:** The log file might contain sensitive information, depending on the output of the script.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires local access to the system since the malicious user has to have access to the /tmp directory, a shared directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must have user privileges on the machine where the vulnerable cron job is running.
- **Basic knowledge of Unix file systems:** Necessary to exploit the insecure usage of /tmp.

**Additional Notes**

- Red Hat Bugzilla indicates that this issue was deemed "NOTABUG" because it did not affect the specific versions of `openshift-origin-msg-node-mcollective` that were shipped with Red Hat OpenShift Online and OpenShift Enterprise 1.x.
- The provided Github commit shows that the vulnerability was fixed by redirecting the output of the script to `/dev/null` instead of `/tmp/facts.log`.
