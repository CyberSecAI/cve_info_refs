The provided content is a security advisory from Huawei regarding a privilege escalation vulnerability in their Versatile Security Manager (VSM).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper validation of authentication when accessing user accounts within the VSM system. Specifically, a user in a default user group can modify the group's privilege configuration without requiring specific authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient authentication for modifying default user group privileges
- Improper access control

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation of VSM default user groups. This can enable users within those groups to operate the system without proper authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker needs network access to the VSM system.
- Attacker requires valid VSM user account credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must have network access to the VSM system.
- Must possess a valid user account within a VSM default user group.
