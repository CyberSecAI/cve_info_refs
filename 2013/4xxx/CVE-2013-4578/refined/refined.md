{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `jarsigner` tool in OpenJDK does not properly detect unsigned bytecode injected into a signed JAR file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient verification of JAR file contents",
      "Failure to detect injected unsigned bytecode"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious actor can inject unsigned bytecode into a signed JAR file. If the application environment trusts the JAR file based on its signature, and unpacks the JAR, the injected bytecode could be executed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Modify a signed JAR file by adding unsigned bytecode"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to modify a signed JAR file by adding new entries without invalidating the existing signature.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists because the `JarVerifier` class only sets the `JarEntry` object for entries with a signature. This allows unsigned entries to be added that won't be caught during verification. While using the signed jar at runtime throws an exception, the vulnerability exists during the unpacking phase where signatures are not evaluated by the unpacking process itself."
