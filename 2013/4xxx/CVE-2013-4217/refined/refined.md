Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4217:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The OSAL crypt module in WiMAX, a user space daemon for Intel 2400m Wireless WiMAX link, logs unencrypted passwords to the log file when a failed attempt to set an encrypted password occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext logging of sensitive data:** The module writes passwords in plaintext to the log file.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive password information is exposed in the log file, which may be accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** A local attacker can gain access to user passwords stored in plaintext.
- **Unauthorized actions:** An attacker could use the obtained passwords to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the legitimate users who set the passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local attacker with access to the system's file system where the log files are stored can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker would need to be able to read the log file to get the plaintext password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires local access to the system where the WiMAX daemon is running.
- The attacker must be able to read the log files produced by the WiMAX daemon.

**Additional Notes:**
- The WiMAX upstream project is considered dead and there were no patches created to fix the vulnerability
- The vulnerability was present in the Fedora 19 release which is now end of life.
