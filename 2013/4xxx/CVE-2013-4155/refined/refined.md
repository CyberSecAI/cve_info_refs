{
  "CVE-2013-4155": {
    "Description": "A denial of service flaw in OpenStack Swift allowed attackers to fill the object server with object tombstones. This could lead to subsequent requests from legitimate users taking an excessive amount of time.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The OpenStack Swift object server did not properly handle DELETE requests with old X-Timestamp values, allowing the creation of superfluous object tombstones.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of timestamps in DELETE requests",
      "Lack of validation on timestamps for tombstone creation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to excessive disk consumption and slowdown of subsequent requests.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending DELETE requests with old X-Timestamp values.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Authenticated attacker with the ability to send requests to the Swift object server"
  }
