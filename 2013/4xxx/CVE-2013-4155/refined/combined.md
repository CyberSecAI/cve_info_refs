## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-swift security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1197)

## Topic

Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Swift (<http://swift.openstack.org>) is a highly available,
distributed, eventually consistent object/blob store.

A denial of service flaw in OpenStack Swift allowed attackers to fill the
object server with object tombstones. This could lead to subsequent
requests from legitimate users taking an excessive amount of time.
(CVE-2013-4155)

This issue was discovered by Peter Portante of Red Hat.

All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
OpenStack Swift services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Package        : swift
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2161 CVE-2013-4155

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Swift, the Openstack
object storage. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-2161

    Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in XML
    handling within Swift account servers. Account strings were
    unescaped in xml listings, and an attacker could potentially
    generate unparsable or arbitrary XML responses which may be
    used to leverage other vulnerabilities in the calling software.

CVE-2013-4155

    Peter Portante from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Swift.
    By issuing requests with an old X-Timestamp value, an
    authenticated attacker can fill an object server with superfluous
    object tombstones, which may significantly slow down subsequent
    requests to that object server, facilitating a Denial of Service
    attack against Swift clusters.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version $squeeze_VERSION.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.8-2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your swift packages.

### Bug Description

Is it possible for an attacker can fill a disk with old tombstones, slowing down object servers in the least with DELETE requests? I am not entirely sure I understand all of the DELETE behavior.

See the following patch which is a unit test which details the behavior (this currently fails on the last check because no metadata is pulled from the tombstone, so the container update is always performed).

I'm going to try to paraphrase what goes on here in order to help me understand what's going on. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Step 1: PUT object, X-Timestamp: t # works

Step 2: DELETE object, X-Timestamp: t+1 # deletes object, creates tombstone w/timestamp at t+1

Step 3: DELETE object, X-Timestamp: t-1 # creates tombstone w/timestamp at t-1

The bug is that Swift will create a tombstone with timestamp t-1 even though there's already a tombstone with a newer time, and so by spamming DELETE requests with timestamps (t-1, t-2, t-3, ...), a user can cause the creation of tons of 0-byte files.

Is that a reasonable restatement of this bug, or am I way off base here?

I think that is a reasonable statement here.

I believe the X-timestamp header is passed through by the proxy server, such that this is possible.

And note that when many files get created in the directory, the directory listing will required a lot of memory to perform os.listdir(), and such an operation on a large directory will starve out other requests (currently not wrapped in threadpool if I remember correctly).

* [unlinkold on largest timestamp](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/%2Bbug/1196932/%2Battachment/3723586/%2Bfiles/unlink.patch)

Yeah X-Timestamp comes through the proxy in part for container sync, it's useful and weird, but there it is.

So the risk is using up inodes on a single file system? If you can get this going on more objects than your estimate there are disks in the cluster you could ruin some poor ops day.

Won't a replication pass clear them out once you get the attacking account cut off?

I tried to write a patch in the object server's DELETE method that would only create the new timestamp if the object was deleted already and the already deleted object's orig\_timestamp was larger than the requests timestamp - but all the branching made it look ugly to me.

I'm sort of inclined to just say:

First, can we confirm that this is an issue? I think it is, but I would like to have someone else go on record as agreeing that it is a problem. ;)

Second, the patch I posted above solves this problem. I am not sure Clay's is sufficient, because we still issue a container update when we don't have to, no?

It might be good for the object server and replicator to just share the code to remove old files, since there's a repetition of logic. Also, does anyone else think it's kind of gross to allow anyone to set X-Timestamp through the API just to allow container sync?

Swift experts: do you see this as a practical vulnerability ? I.e. are vulnerable configurations likely ? If yes, we'll probably have to bless the fix on this bug first, then run through the embargoed disclosure process (<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/VulnerabilityManagement>) before pushing it publicly.

So, a few things:

First: after a replication pass, all the superfluous tombstones are cleaned up.

Second, I can pretty easily reproduce this with these commands:

curl -v -X PUT -H "X-Timestamp: 1373004425" --data-binary "helloworld" -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" <http://192.168.22.2:8080/v1.0/AUTH_test/con/obj>

Obviously, fill in your own Swift cluster's IP and auth token.

So, the bug is real. Is it a security vulnerability? I don't know.

Let's do some napkin math here. Let's say you can create bogus tombstones at a rate of 10 per second, and that a replication pass takes two days. That means you can get 86400 \* 2 \* 10 = 1728000 tombstones before they get cleaned up. Assuming that an os.listdir() returns strings that take 100 bytes of memory each (for reference counting, overhead, and whatever) and you get that an os.listdir() will require ~165 MiB to return its results. That's bad, but not the end of the world on decently-sized hardware, so I don't think that counts as a DoS attack. And that's worst-case, too... if your req/s is lower, or your replicators are faster, or whatever, then the memory usage goes down.

I'm not enough of an XFS expert to comment on the inode exhaustion problem.

I think the memory usage is not the only consideration, but how long it takes to read and parse that many tombstones for os.listdir() and mind you, one has to sort them all as well.

I don't mind declassifying this as a security issue, I just did not want to do that without other folks input.

Who makes the call here?

And also consider that an attacker could fill just one object's directory, and then flood the system with GET requests, which will cause all servers to do that listdir/sort operation at the same time (starving out other requests, etc.).

Am I being paranoid or unrealistic?

We make the call together on if this a security issue or not. (So "everybody and nobody", and that leaves me to make the final call).

On the one hand, this does seem like something that could be an issue for existing clusters (+1 to security issue)

One the other, threadpools completely mitigate this issue (-1 to security)

One the other other, threadpools aren't on by default (+0 for security?)

Whoops. Further discovery has revealed that the listdir that matters (line 216 of obj/server.py) is not in a threadpool. This means threadpools don't help.

I vote for keeping this a security issue because it would allow an attacker to hang a storage node (as Peter described with DELETEs and GETs) or to cause replication and general cluster performance issues by creating so many filesystem objects.

So my first thought is that PUTs would be vulnerable to this as well (create a lot of empty objects with older and older timestamps). However it's not. When given a PUT request, the proxy will first to a HEAD if x-timestamp was given on the request. And if the HEAD response is newer than the PUT x-timestamp value, the proxy short-circuits the response (line 865 in the object controller).

This check is not done on a DELETE. Adding it may make a better patch (????)

Okay, so this seems like it actually constitutes a DoS attack. Ugh.

How's this sound for a proposed fix:

Make it so the object server returns 409 Conflict if you try to make something with an X-Timestamp older than the new thingy on disk. Strictly speaking, this is probably the only bit that has to be done to fix the hole. That's DELETE, PUT, and POST.

This is basically what Peter's patch does, only for more verbs.

Patch commit message:

Fix handling of DELETE obj reqs with old timestamp

The DELETE object REST API was creating tombstone files with old

    timestamps, potentially filling up the disk, as well as sending

    container updates.

Here we now make DELETEs with a request timestamp return a 409 (HTTP

    Conflict) if a data file exists with a newer timestamp, only creating

    tombstones if they have a newer timestamp.

The key fix is to actually read the timestamp metadata from an

    existing tombstone file (thanks to Pete Zaitcev for catching this),

    and then only create tombstone files with newer timestamps.

We also prevent PUT and POST operations using old timestamps as well.

I agree if there is a practical attack scenario we should issue an OSSA about this. The next steps are:

- review the attached patch on the bug, so that we can fast-track its approvals when we make everything public (swift-core team)

- propose and review a backport of the fix for Swift 1.8.0 (grizzly release), which I assume is affected as well (swift-core)

- produce an impact description (VMT team)

- review proposed impact description (everyone)

- request CVE (VMT team)

- coordinate public advisory release and patch merging (VMT team)

John: Will the advisory with the patch be enough, or are you going to want to do a 1.9.1 over this ?

Proposed impact description (will be used in CVE request and public advisory):

----------------------------------

Title: Swift Denial of Service using superfluous object tombstones

Reporter: Peter Portante

Products: Swift

Affects: All versions

Description:

Peter Portante reported a vulnerability in Swift. By issuing a lot of DELETE requests an authenticated attacker can fill an object server with superfluous object tombstones, which may significantly slow down subsequent requests to that object server, facilitating a Denial of Service attack against Swift clusters.

----------------------------------

@all: please check that the description is accurate.

@Peter: do you want us to additionally credit the company you work for, if any ?

They're not mutually exclusive, and I can do mine as a regular change later. I'm good with Peter's idea of rejecting requests that have no effect. It'd probably be good from a end-user perspective as well.

But it's silly that we have a good version of "cleanup object directory" used mostly by the replicator and a shitty version in the object server. Just using the one good version would prevent these kinds of problems.

@John: I agree with Mike, it is not mutually exclusive, and can be applied later.

@Mike: have you thought about the implication that every PUT, POST and DELETE operation will list the directory twice with your patch? Once at DiskFile instantiation, and then again in the final\_put() method? This might cause a general slow-down we should consider and measure. Let me know if I am not understanding the patch correctly.

I replaced the unlinkold call for PUT and DELETE, which was already doing the same listdir.

I'm adding cleanup logic to POST where it didn't exist before, but that might actually fix another DoS attack in this category, if it's writing new .meta files without checking for existing ones. I'll have to read through the code to see if that's the case.

CVE descriptions talk about the vulnerability, not the patch. Proposed final wording:

----------------------------------

Title: Swift Denial of Service using superfluous object tombstones

Reporter: Peter Portante (Red Hat)

Products: Swift

Affects: All versions

Description:

Peter Portante from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Swift. By issuing requests with an old X-Timestamp value, an authenticated attacker can fill an object server with superfluous object tombstones, which may significantly slow down subsequent requests to that object server, facilitating a Denial of Service attack against Swift clusters.

----------------------------------

I'll request the CVE once we get nearer to an acceptable patch.

Yeah, we listdir the hash directory twice.

We probably don't need to do the first listdir for PUTs, POSTs and DELETEs, since we could just write the new file then do a cleanup op. But then I don't think we can do the other patch to reject operations that have no effect.

Or we could re-use the results of the first listdir to clean up, but that could leave multiple .data files laying around for concurrent PUTs.

Really, I'm not that excited about putting a lot of work into it, since the second listdir should generally be serviced by the page cache.

So can we confirm that we have an acceptable propose patch and follow-on work to cleanup a set of usage patterns?

Has anybody taken the proposed patch and verified it themselves?

Please get another +2 on the proposed patches.

Then the plan we agreed with John is to:

- define a public disclosure date

- send the patches as an embargoed disclosure to the distros and public cloud providers so that they coordinate fixes

- on public disclosure date, push the patch to the branches and cut a 1.9.1 RC (milestone-proposed branch)

- Publish 1.9.1 when you're all good with it

Then we'll need a swift-core member to fast-track it through review (based on the pre-approvals we've gathered on this bug) and it will land in master shortly afterwards.

Subject: [OSSA 2013-022] Swift Denial of Service using superfluous object
 tombstones (CVE-2013-4155)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-022
CVE: CVE-2013-4155
Date: August 7, 2013
Title: Swift Denial of Service using superfluous object tombstones
Reporter: Peter Portante (Red Hat)
Products: Swift
Affects: All versions

Description:
Peter Portante from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Swift. By
issuing requests with an old X-Timestamp value, an authenticated
attacker can fill an object server with superfluous object tombstones,
which may significantly slow down subsequent requests to that object
server, facilitating a Denial of Service attack against Swift clusters.

Havana (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/40643>

Grizzly fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/40645>

Folsom fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/40646>

Note:
The havana fix will be included in the upcoming Swift 1.9.1 release.

## Binary packages built by this source

[python-swift](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/python-swift):
distributed virtual object store - Python libraries

OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for

 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized

 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or

 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a

 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then

 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of

 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and

 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control

 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.

 .

 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with

 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and

 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by

 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its

 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to

 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,

 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more

 expensive equipment.

 .

 This package provides the Python libraries that actually implement

 everything.

### Bug Description

Is it possible for an attacker can fill a disk with old tombstones, slowing down object servers in the least with DELETE requests? I am not entirely sure I understand all of the DELETE behavior.

See the following patch which is a unit test which details the behavior (this currently fails on the last check because no metadata is pulled from the tombstone, so the container update is always performed).

I'm going to try to paraphrase what goes on here in order to help me understand what's going on. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Step 1: PUT object, X-Timestamp: t # works

Step 2: DELETE object, X-Timestamp: t+1 # deletes object, creates tombstone w/timestamp at t+1

Step 3: DELETE object, X-Timestamp: t-1 # creates tombstone w/timestamp at t-1

The bug is that Swift will create a tombstone with timestamp t-1 even though there's already a tombstone with a newer time, and so by spamming DELETE requests with timestamps (t-1, t-2, t-3, ...), a user can cause the creation of tons of 0-byte files.

Is that a reasonable restatement of this bug, or am I way off base here?

I think that is a reasonable statement here.

I believe the X-timestamp header is passed through by the proxy server, such that this is possible.

And note that when many files get created in the directory, the directory listing will required a lot of memory to perform os.listdir(), and such an operation on a large directory will starve out other requests (currently not wrapped in threadpool if I remember correctly).

Yeah X-Timestamp comes through the proxy in part for container sync, it's useful and weird, but there it is.

So the risk is using up inodes on a single file system? If you can get this going on more objects than your estimate there are disks in the cluster you could ruin some poor ops day.

Won't a replication pass clear them out once you get the attacking account cut off?

I tried to write a patch in the object server's DELETE method that would only create the new timestamp if the object was deleted already and the already deleted object's orig\_timestamp was larger than the requests timestamp - but all the branching made it look ugly to me.

I'm sort of inclined to just say:

First, can we confirm that this is an issue? I think it is, but I would like to have someone else go on record as agreeing that it is a problem. ;)

Second, the patch I posted above solves this problem. I am not sure Clay's is sufficient, because we still issue a container update when we don't have to, no?

It might be good for the object server and replicator to just share the code to remove old files, since there's a repetition of logic. Also, does anyone else think it's kind of gross to allow anyone to set X-Timestamp through the API just to allow container sync?

Swift experts: do you see this as a practical vulnerability ? I.e. are vulnerable configurations likely ? If yes, we'll probably have to bless the fix on this bug first, then run through the embargoed disclosure process (<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/VulnerabilityManagement>) before pushing it publicly.

So, a few things:

First: after a replication pass, all the superfluous tombstones are cleaned up.

Second, I can pretty easily reproduce this with these commands:

Obviously, fill in your own Swift cluster's IP and auth token.

So, the bug is real. Is it a security vulnerability? I don't know.

Let's do some napkin math here. Let's say you can create bogus tombstones at a rate of 10 per second, and that a replication pass takes two days. That means you can get 86400 \* 2 \* 10 = 1728000 tombstones before they get cleaned up. Assuming that an os.listdir() returns strings that take 100 bytes of memory each (for reference counting, overhead, and whatever) and you get that an os.listdir() will require ~165 MiB to return its results. That's bad, but not the end of the world on decently-sized hardware, so I don't think that counts as a DoS attack. And that's worst-case, too... if your req/s is lower, or your replicators are faster, or whatever, then the memory usage goes down.

I'm not enough of an XFS expert to comment on the inode exhaustion problem.

I think the memory usage is not the only consideration, but how long it takes to read and parse that many tombstones for os.listdir() and mind you, one has to sort them all as well.

I don't mind declassifying this as a security issue, I just did not want to do that without other folks input.

Who makes the call here?

And also consider that an attacker could fill just one object's directory, and then flood the system with GET requests, which will cause all servers to do that listdir/sort operation at the same time (starving out other requests, etc.).

Am I being paranoid or unrealistic?

We make the call together on if this a security issue or not. (So "everybody and nobody", and that leaves me to make the final call).

On the one hand, this does seem like something that could be an issue for existing clusters (+1 to security issue)

One the other, threadpools completely mitigate this issue (-1 to security)

One the other other, threadpools aren't on by default (+0 for security?)

Whoops. Further discovery has revealed that the listdir that matters (line 216 of obj/server.py) is not in a threadpool. This means threadpools don't help.

I vote for keeping this a security issue because it would allow an attacker to hang a storage node (as Peter described with DELETEs and GETs) or to cause replication and general cluster performance issues by creating so many filesystem objects.

So my first thought is that PUTs would be vulnerable to this as well (create a lot of empty objects with older and older timestamps). However it's not. When given a PUT request, the proxy will first to a HEAD if x-timestamp was given on the request. And if the HEAD response is newer than the PUT x-timestamp value, the proxy short-circuits the response (line 865 in the object controller).

This check is not done on a DELETE. Adding it may make a better patch (????)

Okay, so this seems like it actually constitutes a DoS attack. Ugh.

How's this sound for a proposed fix:

Make it so the object server returns 409 Conflict if you try to make something with an X-Timestamp older than the new thingy on disk. Strictly speaking, this is probably the only bit that has to be done to fix the hole. That's DELETE, PUT, and POST.

This is basically what Peter's patch does, only for more verbs.

Patch commit message:

Fix handling of DELETE obj reqs with old timestamp

The DELETE object REST API was creating tombstone files with old

    timestamps, potentially filling up the disk, as well as sending

    container updates.

Here we now make DELETEs with a request timestamp return a 409 (HTTP

    Conflict) if a data file exists with a newer timestamp, only creating

    tombstones if they have a newer timestamp.

The key fix is to actually read the timestamp metadata from an

    existing tombstone file (thanks to Pete Zaitcev for catching this),

    and then only create tombstone files with newer timestamps.

We also prevent PUT and POST operations using old timestamps as well.

I agree if there is a practical attack scenario we should issue an OSSA about this. The next steps are:

- review the attached patch on the bug, so that we can fast-track its approvals when we make everything public (swift-core team)

- propose and review a backport of the fix for Swift 1.8.0 (grizzly release), which I assume is affected as well (swift-core)

- produce an impact description (VMT team)

- review proposed impact description (everyone)

- request CVE (VMT team)

- coordinate public advisory release and patch merging (VMT team)

John: Will the advisory with the patch be enough, or are you going to want to do a 1.9.1 over this ?

Proposed impact description (will be used in CVE request and public advisory):

----------------------------------

Title: Swift Denial of Service using superfluous object tombstones

Reporter: Peter Portante

Products: Swift

Affects: All versions

Description:

Peter Portante reported a vulnerability in Swift. By issuing a lot of DELETE requests an authenticated attacker can fill an object server with superfluous object tombstones, which may significantly slow down subsequent requests to that object server, facilitating a Denial of Service attack against Swift clusters.

----------------------------------

@all: please check that the description is accurate.

@Peter: do you want us to additionally credit the company you work for, if any ?

They're not mutually exclusive, and I can do mine as a regular change later. I'm good with Peter's idea of rejecting requests that have no effect. It'd probably be good from a end-user perspective as well.

But it's silly that we have a good version of "cleanup object directory" used mostly by the replicator and a shitty version in the object server. Just using the one good version would prevent these kinds of problems.

@John: I agree with Mike, it is not mutually exclusive, and can be applied later.

@Mike: have you thought about the implication that every PUT, POST and DELETE operation will list the directory twice with your patch? Once at DiskFile instantiation, and then again in the final\_put() method? This might cause a general slow-down we should consider and measure. Let me know if I am not understanding the patch correctly.

I replaced the unlinkold call for PUT and DELETE, which was already doing the same listdir.

I'm adding cleanup logic to POST where it didn't exist before, but that might actually fix another DoS attack in this category, if it's writing new .meta files without checking for existing ones. I'll have to read through the code to see if that's the case.

Yeah, we listdir the hash directory twice.

We probably don't need to do the first listdir for PUTs, POSTs and DELETEs, since we could just write the new file then do a cleanup op. But then I don't think we can do the other patch to reject operations that have no effect.

Or we could re-use the results of the first listdir to clean up, but that could leave multiple .data files laying around for concurrent PUTs.

Really, I'm not that excited about putting a lot of work into it, since the second listdir should generally be serviced by the page cache.

Please get another +2 on the proposed patches.

Then the plan we agreed with John is to:

- define a public disclosure date

- send the patches as an embargoed disclosure to the distros and public cloud providers so that they coordinate fixes

- on public disclosure date, push the patch to the branches and cut a 1.9.1 RC (milestone-proposed branch)

- Publish 1.9.1 when you're all good with it

Code looks good; both unit and functional tests pass, and I can't make superfluous tombstones any more.

Did the CVE email include the patch for Havana? I was just asked by a package maintainer that said that the email sent didn't include a patch for that.

@Chuck: the patch will be proposed on review.o.o at the public disclosure date: Wednesday, August 7, 1500UTC

Then we'll need a swift-core member to fast-track it through review (based on the pre-approvals we've gathered on this bug) and it will land in master shortly afterwards.

Being 4 hours behind on the East Coast, I plan to be submitting the patch for review at 1100EDT. Just would like one other core member to double check the rebase that will have to occur.

# USN-2001-1: Swift vulnerability

23 October 2013

Swift could cause the system to crash if it received specially crafted
requests over the network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [swift](/security/cves?package=swift) - OpenStack distributed virtual object store

## Details

Peter Portante discovered that Swift did not properly handle requests with

old X-Timestamp values. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to

cause a denial of service via disk consumption.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.
