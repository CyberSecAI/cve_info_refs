Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-4492

**Root Cause:** The `ruby-i18n` gem, specifically when handling missing translations and generating HTML output, did not properly encode special characters in the key names, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The `html_message` method of the `MissingTranslationData` exception in `ruby-i18n` was constructing HTML by directly embedding the translation key without proper escaping.
- **Insufficient Output Encoding:** The core issue is the lack of proper HTML encoding of the key names used in the HTML output for missing translations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS Attacks:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via a crafted translation key. When the application attempted to display a missing translation, the malicious script would be executed in the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Translation Keys:** The attacker needs to control or influence the translation key used by the application. This could happen in various ways, such as:
    - By manipulating input that is used to generate the translation key.
    - Through a vulnerability that allows them to modify the application's translation files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the translation key that will be used by the application when a translation is missing. This might require some knowledge of the application's code or data structures for translation keys.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges within the system, just the ability to inject a malicious translation key.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves HTML escaping of the translation key before including it in the generated HTML. Specifically, `CGI.escape_html` is used to encode the key name.
*   The vulnerability was present in the `html_message` method of the `MissingTranslationData` exception.
*   The `rescue_format` option, which controlled whether to use html or plain text output, was deprecated in favor of always escaping the output.

**Affected Software:**
- `rubygem-i18n` versions prior to the fix.
-  openSUSE 13.1, 12.3, and 12.2
- Debian Wheezy
