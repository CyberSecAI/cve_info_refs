Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2013-4188:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in how Plone retrieves information for certain resources. Specifically, it involves the interaction with Plone's internal traversal machinery (`traverser.py`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The primary weakness is the potential to trigger an infinite loop within the resource retrieval process.
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** This infinite loop leads to uncontrolled consumption of system resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service condition, as the server becomes unresponsive due to the resource exhaustion caused by the infinite loop.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially-crafted Request:** The attack is triggered by issuing a specially crafted request to the Plone server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator Privilege:** The attacker must possess administrator privileges to a specific subset of Plone's action screens or functionality. This suggests that the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with elevated permissions.
