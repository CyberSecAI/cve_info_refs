| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=995581#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-09 19:00:25 UTC  ``` As noted from [1]:  CVE-2013-4751: Validation metadata serialization and loss of information:  Affected versions:  All 2.0.X, 2.1.X, 2.2.X, and 2.3.X versions of the Validator component are affected by this issue.  Description:  When using the Validator component, if Symfony\\Component\\Validator\\Mapping\\Cache\\ApcCache is enabled (or any other cache implementing Symfony\\Component\\Validator\\Mapping\\Cache\\CacheInterface), some information is lost during serialization (the collectionCascaded and the collectionCascadedDeeply fields).  As a consequence, arrays or traversable objects stored in fields using the @Valid constraint are not traversed by the validator as soon as the validator configuration is loaded from the cache.  A patch is also available [2].

Symfony 2.0.24, 2.1.12, 2.2.5, and 2.3.3 have just been released and they
contain security fixes for the Validator component (CVE-2013-4751) and the
HttpFoundation component (CVE-2013-4752).

Even if Symfony 2.0 and 2.1 are out of maintenance, we are still releasing new
versions according to our recent [release policy](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/releases.html#maintenance)
changes.

You can check if your project is up-to-date with the latest security patches
by using the [SensioLabs Security Advisories Checker](https://security.sensiolabs.org/).

## [CVE-2013-4751: Validation metadata serialization and loss of information](#cve-2013-4751-validation-metadata-serialization-and-loss-of-information "Permalink to this headline")

### [Affected versions](#affected-versions "Permalink to this headline")

All 2.0.X, 2.1.X, 2.2.X, and 2.3.X versions of the Validator component are
affected by this issue.

When using the Validator component, if
`Symfony\\Component\\Validator\\Mapping\\Cache\\ApcCache` is enabled (or any
other cache implementing
`Symfony\\Component\\Validator\\Mapping\\Cache\\CacheInterface`), some
information is lost during serialization (the `collectionCascaded` and the
`collectionCascadedDeeply` fields).

As a consequence, arrays or traversable objects stored in fields using the
`@Valid` constraint are **not** traversed by the validator as soon as the
validator configuration is loaded from the cache.

### [Resolution](#resolution "Permalink to this headline")

The patch resolves this issue by adding the missing fields to the
serialization mechanism.

You need to upgrade Symfony to its latest version, according to the branch you
are using for your project, or you can apply the following patch:

* [Download the patch for Symfony 2.0](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/6d555bc1a6013896926ca2aa7861b4bb50629edb.patch);

## [CVE-2013-4752: Request::getHost() poisoning](#cve-2013-4752-request-gethost-poisoning "Permalink to this headline")

### [Affected versions](#affected-versions-1 "Permalink to this headline")

All 2.0.X, 2.1.X, 2.2.X, and 2.3.X versions of the HttpFoundation component
are affected by this issue.

### [Description](#description-1 "Permalink to this headline")

As the `$_SERVER['HOST']` content is an input coming from the user, it can
be manipulated and cannot be trusted. In the recent months, a lot of different
attacks have been discovered relying on inconsistencies between the handling
of the `Host` header by various software (web servers, reverse proxies, web
frameworks, ...). Basically, everytime the framework is generating an absolute
URL (when sending an email to reset a password for instance), the host might
have been manipulated by an attacker. And depending on the configuration of
your web server, the Symfony `Request::getHost()` method might be vulnerable
to some of these attacks.

As these attacks depend on the web server configuration, the fact that you are
using a reverse proxy or not, and many other factors, I recommend you to read
more about this problem that affects frameworks in all languages, in the great
and detailed blog post, [Practical HTTP Host header attacks](http://www.skeletonscribe.net/2013/05/practical-http-host-header-attacks.html).
This article also contains a lot of tips about how to configure your web
server in a more secure way.

### [Resolution](#resolution-1 "Permalink to this headline")

In the past, we did some changes to the `Request::getHost()` method to
mitigate some of these problems (see [PR 6209](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/6209.patch)) by limiting the
allowed characters in a Host, but as it is mostly always the case in such
situations, configuring a set of trusted hosts is the only way to be sure that
your website is secure. That's especially the case for web frameworks as we
cannot dictate a specific configuration for the web server and the reverse
proxies our users are using.

The Symfony releases published today introduce a way to explicitely whitelist
the hosts that your application can respond to. You can configure the whitelist in your
front controllers via the new `Request::setTrustedHosts()` method:

```
1
2
```
```
// declare a list of trusted host patterns.
Request::setTrustedHosts(array('.*\.?trusted.com$'));
```

or you can also configure it as a setting in your framework configuration via
the new `trusted_hosts` option:

```
1
2
```
```
framework:
  trusted_hosts: ['.*\.?trusted.com$']
```

As this whitelist is **optional**, it's up to you to check your web server
configuration to ensure that you are not vulnerable, or a better option is to
configure a list of truted hosts.

You need to upgrade Symfony to its latest version, according to the branch you
are using for your project, or you can apply the following patch:

* [Patch for Symfony 2.0](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/c35cc5b900835827b7ee6b186775eca52f129172.patch);
* [Patch for Symfony 2.1](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/5129d3f5d897ce876bbb22b617c1513afbc686ab...31f0efd7bca0841097d4fbd119ab2704910c8194.patch);
* [Patch for Symfony 2.2](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/5d93815d84128e933a11b178dc51b1c244239245...b8b972fe74e73ac5dc397e25d07e5873339fd286.patch);
* [Patch for Symfony 2.3](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/3911cfa66f32c5fb789e4711ad374f9218b5b1b8...f8ffb80067db596d9ffc52bdfcf0c1aa3397e4df.patch);

As the patches introduce a new parameter, you need to remove the cache
**manually** after upgrading.

Thanks for the update!

I think that the regular expression in trusted\_hosts be updated to: ^(.\*.)?trusted.com$

This way a URL like malicioussitetrusted.com doesn't match the regular expressions, but subdomains like [www.trusted.com](http://www.trusted.com) and other.trusted.com will.

Doesn't the regular expression need a \ before the . in .com ? => '.\*.?trusted.com$'

still anyeviltrusted.com is allowed so
(^|.)trusted.com$ or
(?:^|.)trusted.com$ should be correct

In order to avoid Request::getHost() poisoning, why don't use $\_SERVER['SERVER\_NAME'] instead of $\_SERVER['HOST']?
SERVER\_NAME is not coming from the client but from the web server.
