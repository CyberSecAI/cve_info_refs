Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-4751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the serialization mechanism of the Symfony Validator component when using a cache (specifically, `Symfony\\Component\\Validator\\Mapping\\Cache\\ApcCache` or any other cache implementing `Symfony\\Component\\Validator\\Mapping\\Cache\\CacheInterface`). During serialization, two fields, `collectionCascaded` and `collectionCascadedDeeply`, were not included.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incomplete serialization: The missing fields (`collectionCascaded`, `collectionCascadedDeeply`) in the serialization process caused a loss of information when the validator configuration was loaded from the cache.
- Improper handling of cached validator metadata: The validator would fail to traverse arrays or traversable objects stored in fields that used the `@Valid` constraint, due to the missing fields in the cached metadata.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of validation:** The primary impact is that validation rules, specifically those related to collections and nested objects, could be bypassed. If an application relies on the Validator component to properly validate nested data structures, this vulnerability could lead to invalid data being processed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is not directly exploitable by a remote attacker, but rather, it is a flaw that occurs due to how Symfony Validator component manages cached validation metadata. 
- An attacker could exploit it by manipulating data that would normally be subject to validation rules, but because of the missing cached metadata the data would bypass validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to supply data that should be validated by Symfony, such as through user input forms. They would also need to know that a cached validation configuration is in use.
- No specific privileges are needed other than to supply input to the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue affects all versions of the Validator component in Symfony 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, and 2.3.x.
- Patches were released to resolve this issue by adding the missing fields to the serialization mechanism.
- The fix involves upgrading to the latest version of Symfony for the respective branch or applying the provided patch.
- The vulnerability is related to how metadata for validation is serialized and cached, specifically impacting the traversal of nested objects in validation.

The provided content also mentions a separate vulnerability (CVE-2013-4752) affecting the HttpFoundation component, but that is outside the scope of CVE-2013-4751.
