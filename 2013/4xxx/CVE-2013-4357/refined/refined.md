Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the way the GNU C Library's `getaddrinfo()` function handles memory allocation when processing hostnames. Specifically, it uses `alloca()` to allocate space on the stack, but the size of the allocated buffer is based on the length of the input hostname *without sufficient bounds checking*.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary weakness is the potential for a stack-based buffer overflow. By providing an overly long hostname, an attacker can cause `getaddrinfo()` to allocate a stack buffer that exceeds the available stack space, leading to a crash or potentially other exploitable conditions.
*   **Unbounded alloca():** The use of `alloca()` without proper bounds checking is the direct cause of the overflow. The `alloca()` function allocates memory on the stack, and since the size is not validated it can exceed the stack size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate and likely impact is a denial of service. When the stack overflows, the program will crash, leading to unavailability of services that rely on `getaddrinfo()`.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While less explicitly stated, the potential for arbitrary code execution exists if the attacker can reliably control the overflow and overwrite return addresses on the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** A network attacker can trigger this vulnerability through any network service that relies on name resolution and uses the vulnerable `getaddrinfo()` function (e.g., via DNS queries).
*   **Local:** Local attackers can also trigger this vulnerability through local programs that use the function with attacker-controlled input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Input:** The attacker must be able to supply an overly long hostname to an application that uses the vulnerable `getaddrinfo()` function.
*   **Network Access (Potentially):** For network attacks, the attacker would need network access to the targeted system or the ability to manipulate network traffic to influence hostname resolution.
*   **Local Access (Potentially):** Local user access is needed if exploiting a local vulnerable program.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Function**: The core of the vulnerability is in the `getaddrinfo()` function within the glibc library.  This is a common function used to resolve hostnames into network addresses.
*  **Vulnerable Code Paths**: Specific code paths in the `nscd_getserv_r` function, as well as `gaih_inet_serv` and `gaih_inet`, were also vulnerable due to unbounded stack allocation.
*   **Specific Vulnerability Example**:  Long hostnames can lead to a stack buffer overflow in `nscd_getserv_r` during the name resolution process.
*  **Other affected functions** included `getaliasbyname`, `getaliasbyname_r`, `getservbyname`, `getservbyport`, `getservbyport_r`, and `glob`.

**Affected Systems:**

*   Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 12.04 LTS.
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1-LTSS, 11 SP2-LTSS, 11 SP3, 11 SP4.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 (already addressed with errata).
*   Other systems using vulnerable glibc versions prior to 2.14.

**Mitigation/Fix:**

The vulnerability is resolved by updating the `eglibc`/`glibc` package to versions that include fixes addressing the unbounded stack allocation in the mentioned function. Patches generally involved implementing checks and bounds and/or limiting memory allocations on the stack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   CVE-2012-6686 was initially assigned as a duplicate but later rejected, and CVE-2013-4357 was designated as the primary identifier.
*   A regression introduced by the fix for CVE-2013-4357 led to a memory leak in `getaddrinfo`, particularly on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, requiring further updates (USN-2306-3).
*   Another regression due to the fix for CVE-2013-4357 caused issues with the nscd service on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, which required a further update (USN-2306-2).
