 mod\_dontdothat does not restrict requests from serf based clients.
Summary:
========
mod\_dontdothat allows you to block update REPORT requests against certain
paths in the repository. It expects the paths in the REPORT request
to be absolute URLs. Serf based clients send relative URLs instead
of absolute URLs in many cases. As a result these clients are not blocked
as configured by mod\_dontdothat.
Known vulnerable:
=================
mod\_dontdothat 1.4.0 through 1.7.13
mod\_dontdothat 1.8.0 through 1.8.4
Note that mod\_dontdothat was in contrib until 1.7.3 and contrib is not
included in Subversion source tarballs since 1.7.0, so Subversion 1.7.0
through 1.7.2 did not included mod\_dontdothat (it was still available
from the repository tags for those versions under contrib).
Known fixed:
============
mod\_dontdothat 1.7.14
mod\_dontdothat 1.8.5
Details:
========
mod\_dontdothat allows the blocking of certain update REPORT requests based
on the paths of the requests. This is typically done to block requests
against the root of the repository or the tags and branches directories where
there may be large trees and require a large amount of server resources to
fulfill.
Update REPORT requests are used to fulfill requests from the client for the
following commands:
checkout
update
export
diff (when a server URL or revision other than the BASE is specified)
status -u
copy $URL $WC
The request body for the request includes a src-path and sometimes a
dst-path entity. mod\_dontdothat matches those paths against the configured
paths to deny. When matching the src-path and dst-path, mod\_dontdothat
expects that an absolute URL will be provided. However, serf clients in the
case of the src-path entity only provided a relative path. Relative paths
have been supported by mod\_dav\_svn since before Subversion 1.0, but neon
based clients never produced them.
When a path is not an absolute URL then mod\_dontdothat allowed the request.
As a result a serf client was not blocked by mod\_dontdothat. It's possible
for other clients to be modified to avoid the restrictions as well, though
we are unaware of anyone doing so.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 2.6
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P
We consider this to be a low risk vulnerability. mod\_dontdothat is not
typically installed. It is not intended or useful as an access control
mechanism. Rather it exists primarily to prevent users unintentionally
making expensive requests against the server.
Clients may be able to use more resources than the server admin may have
expected and planned for based on their configuration. This increased
resource usage may impact performance and the availability of the server.
A server admin who has configured mod\_dontdothat would expect matching
update REPORT requests to be blocked, but they will not be with serf based
clients. Serf was added as a http library in Subversion 1.4 as a compile
time option. In 1.5 it was possible to chose it at run time, provided it
had been enabled at compile time. With 1.8 it became the only supported
http library.
As a result clients that can evade these restrictions are in common use and
no special effort is required to do so.
Recommendations:
================
Admins using mod\_dontdothat are advised to upgrade to 1.7.14 or 1.8.5.
It may be possible to configure http to disable all requests without an
absolute URL in the update REPORT requests. However, doing so has the
effect of disabling all serf based clients. Given that serf is the only
http library for 1.8.x we do not recommend doing so.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
