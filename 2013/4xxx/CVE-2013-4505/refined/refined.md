Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `mod_dontdothat` module in Subversion does not correctly handle relative URLs from serf-based clients when blocking update REPORT requests. It expects absolute URLs for path matching, but serf clients often send relative URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect URL Parsing:** `mod_dontdothat` fails to recognize relative URLs in REPORT requests from serf clients, causing the intended path-based blocking mechanism to fail.
*   **Bypass of Intended Restrictions:** The module's purpose is to block update REPORT requests to specific paths (e.g., repository root, tags/branches). Serf clients can bypass these restrictions due to the relative URL issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Increased Resource Usage:** Clients can make expensive requests against the server (e.g., large checkouts/updates) that `mod_dontdothat` was designed to prevent.
*   **Performance Degradation:** The increased resource usage can lead to server performance issues and potentially impact availability.
*   **Unexpected Server Load:**  Administrators configuring `mod_dontdothat` might expect certain requests to be blocked, but serf-based clients could bypass this, leading to unexpected server load.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker (or even a regular user) using a serf-based Subversion client can trigger the vulnerability through standard Subversion operations (checkout, update, export, diff, status, copy).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Subversion Client:** The attacker needs to use a Subversion client that uses the `serf` library. This became the only supported HTTP library starting with Subversion 1.8, making this a common client configuration.
*   **Access to Subversion Server:**  The attacker must have access to the Subversion server that has the vulnerable `mod_dontdothat` module enabled, and be able to send REPORT requests.
*   **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges are required, as this vulnerability is exploitable by any user able to interact with the Subversion server.

**Additional Details:**

*   `mod_dontdothat` is not intended to be an access control mechanism, rather a way to prevent unintentionally large requests.
*   The vulnerability exists in `mod_dontdothat` versions 1.4.0 through 1.7.13 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.4.
*   The fix involves properly handling both relative and absolute URLs in the path matching logic of `mod_dontdothat`.
*   The provided patch demonstrates how the code was corrected to parse and handle the URL.
