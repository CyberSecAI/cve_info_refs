## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-17.31)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-17.31)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1030015#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-11-13 17:30:34 UTC  ``` Commit 1e2bd517c108816220f262d7954b697af03b5f9c ("udp6: Fix udp fragmentation for tunnel traffic.") changed the calculation if there is enough space to include a fragment header in the skb from a skb->mac_header dervived one to skb_headroom. Because we already peeled off the skb to transport_header this is wrong.  This fixes a panic Saran Neti reported. He used the tbf scheduler which skb_gso_segments the skb. The offsets get negative and we panic in memcpy because the skb was erroneously not expanded at the head.  Introduced by: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1e2bd517c108816220f262d7954b697af03b5f9c>  Introduced in: v3.10-rc5  Upstream fix: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0e033e0>  References: <http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=138305762205012&w=2>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Saran Neti of TELUS Security Labs for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1030015#c2)  Petr Matousek    2013-11-13 17:33:51 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1030017](show_bug.cgi?id=1030017 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4563 kernel: net: large udp packet over IPv6 over UFO-enabled device with TBF qdisc panic [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1030015#c3)  Petr Matousek    2013-11-13 17:41:10 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.  This issue did not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1030015#c4)  Fedora Update System    2013-11-24 03:49:06 UTC  ``` kernel-3.11.9-200.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

Commit [1e2bd51](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1e2bd517c108816220f262d7954b697af03b5f9c) ("udp6: Fix udp
fragmentation for tunnel traffic.") changed the calculation if
there is enough space to include a fragment header in the skb from a
skb->mac_header dervived one to skb_headroom. Because we already peeled
off the skb to transport_header this is wrong. Change this back to check
if we have enough room before the mac_header.

This fixes a panic Saran Neti reported. He used the tbf scheduler which
skb_gso_segments the skb. The offsets get negative and we panic in memcpy
because the skb was erroneously not expanded at the head.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-17.31~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-17.31~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Subject: CVE-2013-4563 -- Linux kernel: net: large udp packet over IPv6 over
 UFO-enabled device with TBF qdisc panic

Commit 1e2bd517c108816220f262d7954b697af03b5f9c ("udp6: Fix udp
fragmentation for tunnel traffic.") changed the calculation if
there is enough space to include a fragment header in the skb from a
skb->mac_header dervived one to skb_headroom. Because we already peeled
off the skb to transport_header this is wrong.

This fixes a panic Saran Neti reported. He used the tbf scheduler which
skb_gso_segments the skb. The offsets get negative and we panic in
memcpy because the skb was erroneously not expanded at the head.

Introduced in:
