  "cve": "CVE-2013-4563",
  "description": "The Linux kernel is vulnerable to a denial-of-service. The issue occurs in the IPv6 UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) functionality. A flaw in the calculation of available space for fragment headers, specifically within the udp6_ufo_fragment function, can lead to a panic. This happens when a large UDP packet is processed over IPv6 with UFO enabled, and the traffic is subject to a traffic shaping mechanism such as TBF qdisc, which uses skb_gso_segments. Due to an incorrect calculation, the skb is not properly expanded at the head leading to negative offsets causing a crash during a memcpy operation.",
  "affected_products": [
    "openSUSE 13.1",
    "Ubuntu 13.10",
        "Ubuntu 12.04"

  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect headroom calculation in the udp6_ufo_fragment function when handling UDP fragmentation for tunnel traffic.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect calculation of available space for fragment headers in IPv6 UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing.",
            "Improper handling of skb offsets during Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO), specifically with TBF scheduler."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system panic/crash).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker sends a large UDP packet over IPv6 to a system with UDP Fragmentation Offload enabled.",
            "Traffic is subject to a traffic shaping mechanism such as TBF qdisc which uses skb_gso_segments."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system. No special privileges are required."

    "opensuse": "The vulnerability is resolved by updating the Linux kernel to version 3.11.10",
     "ubuntu": "The vulnerability is resolved by updating the linux kernel to version 3.11.0-17.31 for Ubuntu 13.10 and 3.11.0-17.31~precise1 for Ubuntu 12.04"
