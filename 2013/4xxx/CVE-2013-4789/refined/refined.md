Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw present in the RSS module of Cotonti version 0.9.13.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection, which occurs when user-controlled input is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in a SQL query. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the query and gain unauthorized access or control over the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, modify existing data, or even delete critical information.
- **System Compromise:** In severe cases, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary SQL commands, which could lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **RSS Module:** The vulnerability resides specifically within the RSS module of the Cotonti CMS.
- **Input Manipulation:** Attackers can likely exploit this by crafting malicious input that is then incorporated into the SQL query executed by the RSS module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the SQL injection vulnerability in the RSS module.
- **Access to RSS Functionality:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the RSS module, which is likely publicly available in the Cotonti CMS.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab.
- A fix for this SQL injection vulnerability was committed to the Cotonti GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Cotonti/Cotonti/commit/45eec046391afabb676b62b9201da0cd530360b4`
- The fix was included in the Cotonti Siena 0.9.14 release.
