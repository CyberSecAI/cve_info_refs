Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of temporary files in the `html/rss-newsfeed.php` script of Nagios. Specifically, the script uses a fixed location `/tmp/magpie_cache` for the Magpie RSS cache directory. This fixed location, coupled with insecure file creation, creates a symlink vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The script creates temporary files in a predictable location (`/tmp/magpie_cache`) without using secure methods like `mktemp`.
- **Symlink Vulnerability:** An attacker could exploit the fixed location of the temporary files, using symbolic links to redirect file writes to arbitrary locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files as the root user. This can lead to:

- **Arbitrary File Overwrites:** Overwriting configuration files, system binaries, or other critical data.
- **Potential System Compromise:** By overwriting critical system files, the attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution and fully compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system running Nagios.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a valid local user account on the target system.
- **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of symlink attacks and how they can be used to redirect file writes.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was found in `nagios-3.4.4-1.el6ost/nagios/html/rss-newsfeed.php`
- The vulnerability is addressed by disabling the cache or commenting out the vulnerable line
- The issue is also present in the `nagios.upgrade_to_v3.sh` script (CVE-2013-2029), highlighting a wider pattern of insecure temp file handling.
- Red Hat addressed this issue in RHSA-2013:1526 which included updated packages.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Grant Murphy of the Red Hat Product Security Team.
- Upstream Nagios also tracked this issue under: <http://tracker.nagios.org/view.php?id=450>
