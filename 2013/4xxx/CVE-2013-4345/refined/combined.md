## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1490)

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way IP packets with an Internet Header Length

(ihl) of zero were processed in the skb\_flow\_dissect() function in the
Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger an infinite
loop in the kernel, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4348,
Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-4387, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the creation of

temporary IPv6 addresses. If the IPv6 privacy extension was enabled
(/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use\_tempaddr set to '2'), an attacker on
the local network could disable IPv6 temporary address generation, leading
to a potential information disclosure. (CVE-2013-0343, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled HID (Human Interface

Device) reports with an out-of-bounds Report ID. An attacker with physical
access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888,
Moderate)

* Heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the

Pantherlord/GreenAsia game controller driver, the Logitech force feedback
drivers, and the Logitech Unifying receivers driver handled HID reports.
An attacker with physical access to the system could use these flaws to
crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-2892, CVE-2013-2893, CVE-2013-2895, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the N-Trig touch

screen driver handled HID reports. An attacker with physical access to the
system could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2013-2896, Moderate)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's device

mapper subsystem, under certain conditions, interpreted data written to
snapshot block devices. An attacker could use this flaw to read data from
disk blocks in free space, which are normally inaccessible. (CVE-2013-4299,
Moderate)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the tun\_set\_iff() function in the

Universal TUN/TAP device driver implementation in the Linux kernel.
A privileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
further escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4343, Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in

the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead
to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected
when ANSI CPRNG was used. (CVE-2013-4345, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 SCTP implementation

interacted with the IPsec subsystem. This resulted in unencrypted SCTP
packets being sent over the network even though IPsec encryption was
enabled. An attacker able to inspect these SCTP packets could use this flaw
to obtain potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-4350, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Fujitsu for reporting CVE-2013-4299 and Stephan
Mueller for reporting CVE-2013-4345. The CVE-2013-4348 issue was discovered
by Jason Wang of Red Hat.

Bug fix:

* RoCE appeared to be supported in the MRG Realtime kernel even when the

required user space packages from the HPN channel were not installed.
The Realtime kernel now checks for the HPN channel packages before exposing
the RoCE interfaces. RoCE devices appear as plain 10GigE devices if the
needed HPN channel user space packages are not installed. (BZ#1012993)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
kernel to version kernel-rt-3.8.13-rt14, and correct these issues.
The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-45.68)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-45.68)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-45.68)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-45.68)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-45.68)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-09-04 09:08:47 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's device-mapper subsystem, under certain conditions, interpreted data written to snapshot block devices. Snapshots are constructed from a single "cow" (copy-on-write) device that contains a mixture of data and metadata, and the bug involves a user writing a data block that is later incorrectly interpreted as metadata controlling how blocks are mapped.  An attacker could construct a mapping to read data from disk blocks in 'free space' that is normally inaccessible.  Please note that apart from having security consequences (data leak), this bug is also a data corruptor.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Fujitsu for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c15)  Alasdair Kergon     2013-10-16 12:28:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 812893](attachment.cgi?id=812893&action=diff "Patch proposed for upstream kernels") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=812893&action=edit "Patch proposed for upstream kernels") Patch proposed for upstream kernels   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-16 17:21:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1436 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1436.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c17)  Alasdair Kergon     2013-10-18 01:38:52 UTC  ``` Links to upstream merge:  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e9c6a182649f4259db704ae15a91ac820e63b0ca>  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8359ffa56595b5b56ea690810cace53e13618269>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-22 17:04:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2013:1450 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1450.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-22 17:33:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:1449 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1449.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-31 16:29:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2013:1490 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1490.html>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-13 18:54:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2013:1519 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1519.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-14 17:41:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:1520 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1520.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-12-05 17:10:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2013:1783 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1783.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1004233#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-12-19 21:29:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:1860 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1860.html>   ``` |  |

## Details

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Jason Wang discovered a bug in the network flow dissector in the Linux

kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2013-4348](/security/CVE-2013-4348))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the Linux Kernel's kvm\_vm\_ioctl\_create\_vcpu

function of the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem. A local user could

exploit this flaw to gain privileges on the host machine. ([CVE-2013-4587](/security/CVE-2013-4587))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the apic\_get\_tmcct function of the Kernel

Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem if the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or host OS system crash.

([CVE-2013-6367](/security/CVE-2013-6367))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1443-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1443.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1443.62)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

driver for the SystemBase Multi-2/PCI serial card. An unprivileged user

could obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-4516](/security/CVE-2013-4516))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1011927#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-09-25 12:05:55 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the IPv6 protocol(CONFIG_IPV6) support and an Ethernet driver(ex. virtio-net) which has a UDP Fragmentation Offload(UFO) feature ON is vulnerable to inadvertent memory corruptions and NULL pointer dereference  flaw. It could occur while sending a large messages over an IPv6 connection.  Though the crash occurs while sending messages, it could be triggered through a  remote client by requesting larger data from a server.  A remote user user could use this flaw to crash the kernel, resulting in DoS. Despite the random nature of the memory corruptions, potential privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.  Upstream fix: -------------  -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/2811ebac2521ceac84f2bdae402455baa6a7fb47>  Reference: ----------  -> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/09/29/1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1011927#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2013-09-25 12:11:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the version of the kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-237-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-237.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-237.53)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Stephan Mueller reported to me recently a error in random number generation in
the ansi cprng. If several small requests are made that are less than the
instances block size, the remainder for loop code doesn't increment
rand_data_valid in the last iteration, meaning that the last bytes in the
rand_data buffer gets reused on the subsequent smaller-than-a-block request for
random data.

The fix is pretty easy, just re-code the for loop to make sure that
rand_data_valid gets incremented appropriately

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1012550#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-09-26 15:52:00 UTC  ``` The emulation of the outs instruction for 64-bit PV guests uses an uninitialized variable as the segment base for the source data if an FS: or GS: segment override is used, and if the segment descriptor the respective non-null selector in the corresponding selector register points to cannot be read by the emulation code (this is possible if the segment register was loaded before a more recent GDT or LDT update, i.e. the segment register contains stale data).  A malicious guest might be able to get hold of contents of the hypervisor stack, through the fault address passed to the page fault handler if the outs raises such a fault (which is mostly under guest control). Other methods for indirectly deducing information also exist.  A malicious 64-bit PV guest might conceivably gain access to sensitive data relating to other guests.   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1012550#c6)  Vincent Danen    2013-10-10 16:19:57 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-67.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1012550#c7)  Vincent Danen    2013-10-10 16:22:34 UTC  ```  Created xen tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1017843](show_bug.cgi?id=1017843 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4371 CVE-2013-4370 CVE-2013-4368 CVE-2013-4369 CVE-2013-4375 xen: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1012550#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-22 17:31:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:1449 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1449.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1012550#c9)  Fedora Update System    2013-10-23 03:34:09 UTC  ``` xen-4.2.3-4.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Jason Wang discovered a bug in the network flow dissector in the Linux

kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2013-4348](/security/CVE-2013-4348))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-45.68~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-237-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-237.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-237.53)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1645)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, address several
hundred bugs, and add numerous enhancements are now available as part of
the ongoing support and maintenance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.
This is the fifth regular update.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-4387, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the creation of

temporary IPv6 addresses. If the IPv6 privacy extension was enabled
(/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use\_tempaddr set to '2'), an attacker on the
local network could disable IPv6 temporary address generation, leading to a
potential information disclosure. (CVE-2013-0343, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled HID (Human Interface

Device) reports with an out-of-bounds Report ID. An attacker with physical
access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888,
Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in

the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead
to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected
when ANSI CPRNG was used. (CVE-2013-4345, Moderate)

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-2375 released via RHSA-2012:1580

accidentally removed a check for small-sized result buffers. A local,
unprivileged user with access to an NFSv4 mount with ACL support could use
this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
the system . (CVE-2013-4591, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way IOMMU memory mappings were handled when

moving memory slots. A malicious user on a KVM host who has the ability to
assign a device to a guest could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2013-4592, Moderate)

* Heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the Zeroplus and

Pantherlord/GreenAsia game controllers handled HID reports. An attacker
with physical access to the system could use these flaws to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-2889, CVE-2013-2892, Moderate)

* Two information leak flaws were found in the logical link control (LLC)

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use
these flaws to leak kernel stack memory to user space. (CVE-2012-6542,
CVE-2013-3231, Low)

* A heap-based buffer overflow in the way the tg3 Ethernet driver parsed

the vital product data (VPD) of devices could allow an attacker with
physical access to a system to cause a denial of service or, potentially,
escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1929, Low)

* Information leak flaws in the Linux kernel could allow a privileged,

local user to leak kernel memory to user space. (CVE-2012-6545,
CVE-2013-1928, CVE-2013-2164, CVE-2013-2234, Low)

* A format string flaw was found in the Linux kernel's block layer.

A privileged, local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their
privileges to kernel level (ring0). (CVE-2013-2851, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Stephan Mueller for reporting CVE-2013-4345,
and Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2013-2851.

This update also fixes several hundred bugs and adds enhancements. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Release Notes for information on the most
significant of these changes, and the Technical Notes for further
information, both linked to in the References.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 users are advised to install these updated
packages, which correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Release Notes and
Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1007690#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-09-13 07:04:13 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way ansi cprng implementation in the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. If several small requests are made that are less than the instances block size, the remainder for loop code doesn't increment rand_data_valid in the last iteration, meaning that the last bytes in the rand_data buffer gets reused on the subsequent smaller-than-a-block request for random data.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Stephan Mueller for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1007690#c4)  Petr Matousek    2013-09-17 18:39:28 UTC  ``` Proposed upstream patch:  <http://marc.info/?l=linux-crypto-vger&m=137942122902845&w=2>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1007690#c5)  Petr Matousek    2013-09-17 18:42:19 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-237-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-237.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-237.53)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# USN-2065-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities

3 January 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's IP Virtual Server (IP\_VS)

support. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to gain additional administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4588](/security/CVE-2013-4588))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-360-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-360.73](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-360.73)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-2158-1: Linux kernel (Raring HWE) vulnerabilities

1 April 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-raring](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-raring) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Raring

## Details

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the

implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. ([CVE-2013-6382](/security/CVE-2013-6382))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when built with the

NetFilter Connection Tracking (NF\_CONNTRACK) support for IRC protocol

(NF\_NAT\_IRC). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain

potentially sensitive kernel information when communicating over a client-

to-client IRC connection(/dcc) via a NAT-ed network. ([CVE-2014-1690](/security/CVE-2014-1690))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-38.56~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-38.56~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Synopsis

Moderate: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1449)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the creation of

temporary IPv6 addresses. If the IPv6 privacy extension was enabled
(/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use\_tempaddr is set to '2'), an attacker on
the local network could disable IPv6 temporary address generation, leading
to a potential information disclosure. (CVE-2013-0343, Moderate)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's device

mapper subsystem, under certain conditions, interpreted data written to
snapshot block devices. An attacker could use this flaw to read data from
disk blocks in free space, which are normally inaccessible. (CVE-2013-4299,
Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in

the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead
to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected
when ANSI CPRNG was used. (CVE-2013-4345, Moderate)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way Xen hypervisor emulated the

OUTS instruction for 64-bit paravirtualized guests. A privileged guest user
could use this flaw to leak hypervisor stack memory to the guest.
(CVE-2013-4368, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Fujitsu for reporting CVE-2013-4299, Stephan
Mueller for reporting CVE-2013-4345, and the Xen project for reporting
CVE-2013-4368.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* A bug in the GFS2 code prevented glock work queues from freeing

glock-related memory while the glock memory shrinker repeatedly queued a
large number of demote requests, for example when performing a simultaneous
backup of several live GFS2 volumes with a large file count. As a
consequence, the glock work queues became overloaded which resulted in a
high CPU usage and the GFS2 file systems being unresponsive for a
significant amount of time. A patch has been applied to alleviate this
problem by calling the yield() function after scheduling a certain amount
of tasks on the glock work queues. The problem can now occur only with
extremely high work loads. (BZ#1014714)

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.
