  "CVE-2013-4345": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected when ANSI CPRNG was used.",
    "root_cause": "The ANSI CPRNG implementation in the Linux kernel had an off-by-one error when processing non-block size aligned requests. The remainder for loop code doesn't increment rand_data_valid in the last iteration causing reuse of bytes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Off-by-one error",
      "Insufficient entropy generation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
