| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1025718#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2013-11-01 11:21:50 UTC  ``` Libgadu, an open library for communicating using the protocol e-mail, was found to have missing the ssl certificate validation. The issue is that libgadu uses openSSL library for creating secure connections. A program using openSSL can perform SSL handshake by invoking the SSL_connect function. Some cetrificate validation errors are signaled through, the return values of the SSL_connect, while for the others errors SSL_connect returns OK but sets internal "verify result" flags. Application must call ssl_get_verify_result function to check if any such errors occurred.  This check seems to be missing in libgadu. And thus a man-in-the-middle attack is possible failing all the SSL protection.  Upstream suggested that it was a concious decision as libgadu is reverse-engineered implementation of a proprietary protocol, they had no control over the certificates used for SSL connections, so they would add a note to the documentation about this.

which may result in execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/libgadu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.12.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.12.0** |

### Background

libgadu is a library that implements the client side of the Gadu-Gadu
protocol.

### Description

libgadu contains multiple vulnerabilities:

* X.509 certificates are not properly validated (CVE-2013-4488)
* A integer overflow error could lead to a buffer overflow
  (CVE-2013-6487)
* Malformed responses from a Gadu-Gadu file relay server are not
  properly handled (CVE-2014-3775)

### Impact

A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or spoof
servers.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libgadu users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/libgadu-1.12.0"

```

```
Hi,

I would like to report a security bug in libgadu.  libgadu is using openSSL
library for creating secure connections.
```
```

A program using openSSL can perform SSL handshake by invoking the
SSL_connect function. Some cetrificate validation errors are signaled
through , the return values of the SSL_connect, while for the others errors
SSL_connect returns OK but sets internal "verify result" flags. Application
must call ssl_get_verify_result function to check if any such errors
occurred.  This check is missing in libgadu. And thus a man-in-the-middle
attack is possible failing all the SSL protection. (Please refer :-
<https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_ccs12.pdf>)

Another way to verify SSL certificate is using the api
SSL_CTX_set_verify.The SSL_CTX_set_verify() API allows you to set the
verification flags in the SSL_CTX structure and a callback function for
customized verification as its third argument. (Setting NULL to the
callback function means the built-in default verification function is
used.) In the second argument of SSL_CTX_set_verify(), you can set the
following macro
(Please refer:- <http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_verify.html>)

1. SSL_VERIFY_NONE
Server mode: the server will not send a client certificate request to the
client, so the client will not send a certificate.

Client mode: if not using an anonymous cipher (by default disabled), the
server will send a certificate which will be checked. The result of the
certificate verification process can be checked after the TLS/SSL handshake
using the SSL_get_verify_result function. The handshake will be continued
regardless of the verification result.

2. SSL_VERIFY_PEER
3. SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT
4. SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE

However, In libgadu SSL_CTX_set_verify() API  is used but the second
parameter is SSL_VERIFY_NONE and third parameter is NULL, Which means we
should  use SSL_get_verify_result API to verify the peer certificate. But
SSL_get_verify_result API is not used anywhere in libgadu code base which
make the product vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack.

So the product using libgadu will be vulnerable to  man-in-the-middle
attack.

Ok. So. Based on this reply:

[http://www.mail-archive.com/libgadu-devel@lists.ziew.org/msg01018.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/libgadu-devel%40lists.ziew.org/msg01018.html)

=================
It was rather a conscious decision. Since libgadu is a
reverse-engineered implementation of a proprietary protocol, we have no
control over the certificates used for SSL connections. We don't know
which certificates will be accepted or rejected by the original client,
so there is no reliable way to verify their validity in libgadu. But
since you mentioned it, I guess we should at least add a note to the
documentation.
=================

So basically that's good enough for me. Please use CVE-2013-4488 for
this issue.
