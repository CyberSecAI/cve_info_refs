{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The python-glanceclient was failing to properly check certificates during the establishment of HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing SSL certificate check in Python glance client"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker with access over segments of the network between client and server could potentially set up a man-in-the-middle attack and access the contents of the Glance client request (or response).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker with access over segments of the network between client and server.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists because the `verify_callback` function in `python-glanceclient` incorrectly handles the `preverify_ok` parameter which is an integer, not a boolean. The code `if depth == 0 and preverify_ok is True:` will never pass since an integer can't be `True`."
