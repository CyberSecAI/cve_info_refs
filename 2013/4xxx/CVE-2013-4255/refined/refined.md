{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The condor_startd service would terminate if a policy definition evaluated to either ERROR or UNDEFINED. This could be triggered by submitting a Condor job that caused a policy definition (CONTINUE, KILL, PREEMPT, or SUSPEND) to evaluate to ERROR or UNDEFINED, due to an attribute defined on the job being referenced.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of policy definition evaluation results leading to a denial-of-service condition."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause a denial of service of the condor_startd service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker submits a crafted Condor job that, when evaluated by a condor_startd policy definition (CONTINUE, KILL, PREEMPT, or SUSPEND), leads to an ERROR or UNDEFINED state.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit jobs to the Condor service. They need to know which attributes are used in the policy configuration."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_configurations": "The vulnerability is triggered if an administrator uses an attribute defined on a job in the condor_startd policies (CONTINUE, KILL, PREEMPT, or SUSPEND). The default HTCondor configuration was not affected.",
    "workaround": "Check for UNDEFINED & ERROR in the policy configuration."
