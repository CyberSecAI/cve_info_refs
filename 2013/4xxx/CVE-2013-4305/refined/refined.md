Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the `example.php` script included with the `SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi` MediaWiki extension. This script used the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable directly in the form's action attribute without proper sanitization, which allowed for a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The `example.php` script reflected user-supplied input (through `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`) back to the user's browser without proper encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they accessed the vulnerable `example.php` page. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The primary attack vector was through crafting a malicious URL that, when accessed, would inject JavaScript into the page through the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable. For example, the provided PoC URL demonstrates this:
    `http://localhost/wiki/extensions/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi/geshi/contrib/example.php/"><img src="asd" onerror="alert(1);">`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Extension:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi` extension and the existence of the vulnerable `example.php` script.
*   **Ability to Craft a Malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious URL that injects their JavaScript payload into the `PHP_SELF` variable.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a victim to click the malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the `contrib/example.php` script, which was intended for development/example purposes and shouldn't be deployed in production systems.
*   The issue was initially difficult to reproduce because some web servers rewrite the requested URI, mitigating the immediate risk in some default configurations.
*   The fix involved removing the `contrib` directory and adding it to the `.gitignore`, effectively removing the vulnerable file from distribution. An alternative patch was proposed by upstream which URL-encoded `PHP_SELF`.
