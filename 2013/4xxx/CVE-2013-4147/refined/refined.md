Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is the presence of format string vulnerabilities in the `yardradius` software. This occurs because user-controlled input (`fmt`) is used directly in format string functions like `vfprintf`, `vsnprintf`, `syslog`, and `vsyslog` without proper sanitization or use of a fixed format string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **`log_msg` function in `src/log.c`:**
    -   The `log_msg` function takes a format string (`fmt`) and arguments (`args`). It uses `vfprintf(msgfd, fmt, args)` and `vsnprintf(buffer,1024,fmt, args)` which are vulnerable if the `fmt` parameter contains format string specifiers (e.g., %x, %n). Also uses  `syslog(priority, buffer)` and `vsyslog(priority, fmt, args)` where `buffer` and `fmt` can contain format string specifiers.
2.  **`version` and `build_version` functions in `src/version.c`:**
    - The `version` function calls `build_version` to construct a version string using `snprintf`. The `STRVER` macro, defined as `"%s : YARD Radius Server %s ... $ "`, is used as a format string argument to `snprintf`.  By controlling the program name (`progname`), an attacker can inject format string specifiers, as demonstrated with the symbolic link trick.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use format string specifiers like `%x` to read from the stack, disclosing potentially sensitive memory addresses.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting the format string vulnerability could lead to crashes due to memory corruption from writing to arbitrary memory locations.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The vulnerability could potentially be used to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code by using format string specifiers such as `%n`.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **`log_msg` function:**
    -   An attacker would need to control the `fmt` parameter passed to the `log_msg` function. This implies access or control over the part of the application that generates the log messages.
2.  **`version` function:**
    -   The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by creating a symbolic link to the `radiusd` executable with a name containing format string specifiers, like `%x`. Executing this symbolic link with the `-v` flag triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   For the `log_msg` vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to influence the format string parameter that is passed to the `log_msg` function.
-   For the `version` vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to create symbolic links and execute the program.
-   In general, these vulnerabilities can be exploited by any user able to execute `yardradius` or influence the parameters of the logging functionality.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in `yardradius` version 1.1.2-4.
- The issue is reported as a grave security risk.
- The `syslog` and `vsyslog` calls in `log_msg`, and the use of `vfprintf` and `vsnprintf` with untrusted format strings are the vulnerable areas.
-  The report also suggests that more instances of such vulnerabilities might exist in the source code.
- A CVE ID CVE-2013-4147 has been assigned to this issue.
- The bug was fixed by removing the package from the Debian archive.
