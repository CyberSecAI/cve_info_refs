| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=991757#c0)  Pedro Ribeiro    2013-08-04 09:44:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 782447](attachment.cgi?id=782447&action=diff "Patch to correct the buffer overflows") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=782447&action=edit "Patch to correct the buffer overflows") Patch to correct the buffer overflows  Description of problem:  I have found three (lame) buffer overflows in lcms-1.19. The problem lies in the use of dangerous functions like scanf and sprintf to handle user input.  I have contacted the Little CMS developer and his answer was that "people concerned about security should update to Little CMS v2". To be honest I think it's a reasonable answer since he has stopped supporting lcms-1 in 2009. However this appears to be a package that is still widely in use in several distributions, and included in other software as a library.  I am attaching patches here to address the issue. These have been compile tested but I did not do any test beyond that. Please note that I am sending this via a mobile device and the patches might be mangled (hopefully not).  If you have any questions please contact me back. If you do issue an advisory, please credit Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib).  Regards,  Pedro  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 1.19  Additional info: Patch attached   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=991757#c2)  Pedro Ribeiro    2013-08-05 18:00:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 782955](attachment.cgi?id=782955&action=diff "The proper patch that fixes the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=782955&action=edit "The proper patch that fixes the issue") The proper patch that fixes the issue  Please note that I have committed a stupid and lame mistake and actually introduced a format string vulnerability with the previous patch. This is the correct patch and should fix the issue, but please review it anyway.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=991757#c4)  Pedro Ribeiro    2013-08-06 11:40:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 783274](attachment.cgi?id=783274&action=diff "Yet another version of the patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=783274&action=edit "Yet another version of the patch") Yet another version of the patch  Yet another version of the patch, as per the comments in <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=718682#40>.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=991757#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-22 15:20:27 UTC  ``` Thanks for this, Pedro.  I'm going to turn this into an SRT bug.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=991757#c7)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-22 15:45:10 UTC  ``` Bah, this already had a bug.  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 992975](show_bug.cgi?id=992975 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4276 lcms: Stack-based buffer overflows in ColorSpace conversion calculator and TIFF compare utility") ***   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=992975#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-05 10:41:50 UTC  ``` Three (two in ColorSpace conversion calculator, one in TIFF compare utility) stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way icctrans / tiffdiff tools of LittleCMS, the color management system, used to process certain ICC color profile / TIFF image format files. Remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted ICC color profile / TIFF image format files that, when opened in color space conversion calculator (icctrans) or TIFF compare utility (tiffdiff) of LittleCMS would lead to that utility crash.

Ahhh sigh. One note: if anyone sees security related flaws in our BZ
not marked as such please set the "Security" keyword and SRT will get
magically notified and we'll take a look at it.

Please use CVE-2013-4276 for this issue.

Package: liblcms1
Version: 1.19
Severity: grave
Tags: upstream security patch
Justification: user security hole

I have found three (lame) buffer overflows in lcms-1.19. The problem lies in
the use of dangerous functions like scanf and sprintf to handle user input.

I have contacted the Little CMS developer and his answer was that "people
concerned about security should update to Little CMS v2". To be honest I think
it's a reasonable answer since he has stopped supporting lcms-1 in 2009.
However this appears to be a package that is still widely in use in several
distributions, and included in other software as a library.

I am attaching patches here to address the issue. These have been compile
tested but I did not do any test beyond that. Please note that I am sending
this via a mobile device and the patches might be mangled (hopefully not).

If you have any questions please contact me back. If you do issue an advisory,
please credit Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com).

Note that I have contacted the security team and was instructed to report this
bug here.

Regards,
Pedro

This sscanf call is wrong and introduces a format string vulnerability.
sscanf's signature is int sscanf(const char* str, const char* fmt, ...)
where str is used as input and format is the second argument.

Thanks for that Alan - I had no idea, and have been looking at lots of C
code lately that has probably has the same mistakes. I will keep an eye on
that.

Ok this patch is turning into a trainwreck - to everyone please be careful
when applying it.
Actually my original idea was more to point to the vulnerabilities that to
actually provide a working patch, but since lcms1 is not maintained
actively any more I decided to produce this. I guess in the future I will
say any patches I send are "provided only an example" and should not be
applied direclty..

Pedro

sizeof() in the C language does not reach through a pointer to find the size of
the underlying object - that code will always set Buffer_size to the size of
the pointer itself (4 bytes on 32-bit, 8 bytes on 64-bit), not the size of the
buffer the pointer is pointing to.

[Noticed when someone suggested we apply the patch from Debian to our packages
 as well.]

Oops, forgot to mention the sscanf is still wrong in this second revision.
This code now reads a line from stdin and writes it to Buffer.  The sscanf
now takes Buffer as input, looks for a string pattern matching %s and writes
it to, well, whatever the random uninitialized value is next on the stack,
because there is no output argument provided for the %s.   Fortunately,
gcc -Wformat should find this and error out before anyone ships it.

Of course, since this is used in a function that expects the string to be
returned in Buffer, having sscanf read from Buffer and write the result
somewhere else is also counterproductive.

Thanks again for the feedback Alan.

I have uploaded the newer version of the patch to the redhat bugzilla

Hallo Oleksandr,

I just saw that you have a LowNMU policy, but you'd like to be contacted
before doing the actual NMU.

Well, I'm currently preparing a NMU for the lcms* to fix some CVE and a
fatal lintian error. Please feel

(* I'm talking about the "old" lcms-1, not the lcms2 ... just to avoid
confusion)

Please note that I cannot upload the NMU by myself, so I will ask my AM,
Thijs Kinkhorst (CC'ed) to put the upload into DELAYED/8 if he approves
(and you not vetoing).
I've choosen DELAYED/8 because I will be away from computers starting
tomorrow for a week, and I'd like to be available when the package
enters the queue.

This is the current changelog for the intended NMU:

lcms (1.19.dfsg1-1.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Apply fix from OpenSuse for [CVE-2013-4276](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4276) (Closes: #[718682](bugreport.cgi?bug=718682))
  * Repack orig-source to remove non-dfsg free color profiles. This is
    necessary as the resulting lintian error
    license-problem-md5sum-non-free-file would lead to an autoreject
    (Closes: #[736806](bugreport.cgi?bug=736806)).
  * Fix [CVE-2013-4160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4160) by backporting the fix from lcms-2 (Closes:
#[728208](bugreport.cgi?bug=728208))

 -- Tobias Frost <tobi@coldtobi.de>  Thu, 27 Mar 2014 12:20:24 +0100

I already attached the patches I will use for the CVS's to the BTS,
but of course I will also send an complete nmudiff later to the BTS.

Best regards,

Tobi
