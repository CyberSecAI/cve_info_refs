{
  "CVE-2013-4784": {
    "Description": "The provided content discusses the IPMI 2.0 specification and the presence of \"cipher zero\", which allows authentication to IPMI without a password. This is used to exploit systems via IPMI.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The IPMI 2.0 specification includes a cipher suite known as \"cipher zero\", which effectively disables authentication.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "The default enabling of cipher zero in IPMI implementations",
      "Lack of proper authentication enforcement when cipher zero is enabled"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain full administrative access to a server by using cipher zero with a valid IPMI user account, without knowing the user's password. This enables the attacker to modify the server's configuration and control its hardware, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network access to an IPMI interface with cipher zero enabled."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network connectivity to the target's IPMI interface and a valid IPMI user account. They do not need the password to exploit this vulnerability if cipher zero is enabled."
