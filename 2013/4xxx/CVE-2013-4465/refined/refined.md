**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Server Compromise:** An attacker could potentially gain complete control over the affected server by executing arbitrary code.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker might be able to modify or deface the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can use the compromised server to distribute malware to other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Avatar Upload:** The primary attack vector involves using the forum's avatar upload functionality.
*   **Web Browser:** An attacker uses a web browser to access the forum and upload a malicious file as an avatar.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The exploit is achieved through HTTP requests to the vulnerable part of the application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Forum Access:** An attacker must have access to an SMF forum that is vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Upload an Avatar:** The attacker must have the ability to upload an avatar, usually requiring some user role within the forum.
*   **Network Connectivity:** An attacker must have network connectivity to the forum to exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects SMF versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x.
*  The specific files affected have been removed from public view.
