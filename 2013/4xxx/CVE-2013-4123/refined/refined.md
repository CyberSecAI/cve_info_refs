  "CVE-2013-4123": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect data validation when processing HTTP requests.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of port values in the Host header. Specifically, the code uses `xatoi` to convert a string to an integer, but this function does not perform robust input validation. The vulnerability lies in the parsing of port numbers within the Host header of an HTTP request."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service. A client can send a specially crafted HTTP request that causes the Squid proxy server to crash or become unresponsive.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious client can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Squid proxy server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Squid server."
  }
