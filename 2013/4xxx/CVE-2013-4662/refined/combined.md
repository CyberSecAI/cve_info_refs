# CiviCRM JIRA issue archive

We have migrated from JIRA to Gitlab! New issues must be created on Gitlab at <https://lab.civicrm.org/groups/dev/-/issues>. For more information: [Gitlab roadmap](https://lab.civicrm.org/infrastructure/ops/wikis/gitlab-roadmap) and [updates on the migration status](https://lab.civicrm.org/infrastructure/ops/issues/817). Issue creation was disabled on March 31st 2018. The site was converted to a static archive on December 27 2018.

You can still access old (read-only) JIRA issues if you know their issue number.

For example: <https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21203>

You can also browse the archived issues for a specific project:

# CIVI-SA-2013-004 - Limited SQL Injection via Quick Search API

Published
2013-06-05 10:27

Written by
[totten](/users/totten "View user profile.")

The "Quick Search" bar in CiviCRM v4.3 includes a backend for processing search requests which is split in two layers. Both layers may be accessed remotely by backend users with permission "access CiviCRM." A malicious user may bypass one layer (which performs SQL validation/escaping) and call the second layer directly (thus bypassing SQL validation/escaping).

Note: The scope of the SQL injection is limited compared to a typical SQL injection because CiviCRM's SQL API does not accept SQL queries with multiple statements. Consequently:

* Attackers *cannot* inject new SQL statements involving INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, etc.
* An attacker *can* inject a sub-SELECT to implicitly reveal data from unrelated SQL tables.
* An attacker *can* inject an inline variable-assignment ("SELECT @some\_mysql\_session\_var := 2").

Security Risk
Less Critical
