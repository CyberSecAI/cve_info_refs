Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The "Quick Search" functionality in CiviCRM versions 4.2 and 4.3 has a two-layered backend for processing search requests.
- The vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker to bypass the first layer, which performs SQL validation/escaping, and directly access the second layer, thus bypassing the intended SQL security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.
- **Bypass of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the intended input validation and sanitization performed by the first layer of the search processing backend.
- **Direct Access to Underlying Layer:** The system allows direct access to the underlying data processing layer, which was not designed to handle potentially malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Limited Scope SQL Injection:** The impact is limited because CiviCRM's SQL API does not allow multiple SQL statements in a single query.
- **Data Disclosure:** An attacker can inject sub-SELECT statements to reveal data from unrelated database tables.
- **Variable Assignment:** An attacker can inject inline variable assignments (e.g., `SELECT @some_mysql_session_var := 2`).
- **No Modification of Data:** Attackers cannot inject SQL statements to modify data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, etc.).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct API Call:** The attack vector is through bypassing the first layer of the Quick Search API and calling the underlying layer directly.
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by backend users with the "access CiviCRM" permission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Backend User:** An attacker must have a valid backend user account with the "access CiviCRM" permission.
- **Technical Knowledge:** An attacker needs to be aware of the specific API structure to craft SQL injection payloads.
- **No direct access to the server is required, only access to the CiviCRM instance as a backend user.**

**Affected Versions:**
- CiviCRM v4.2.0 - v4.2.9
- CiviCRM v4.3.0 - v4.3.3

**Fixed Versions:**
- CiviCRM v4.2.10
- CiviCRM v4.3.4 and later

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-4662
