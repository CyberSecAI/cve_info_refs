Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how `omniauth-facebook` (Ruby gem) version 1.4.1 implemented CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection. The gem allowed a per-request 'state' parameter to be set by storing it in the session, which could be exploited to bypass the intended CSRF protection mechanism.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken CSRF Protection:** The core issue is that the CSRF protection added in version 1.4.1 of the `omniauth-facebook` gem could be easily circumvented.
- **Session Storage Misuse:** The vulnerability lies in the way the `state` parameter was handled by storing it in the session.  

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **CSRF Attacks:** Attackers could potentially perform CSRF attacks, which could lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of users if they are tricked into clicking malicious links or visiting malicious pages.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious links or pages**: An attacker could construct a malicious link or webpage that, when clicked by a user logged into a site using the vulnerable `omniauth-facebook` gem, could execute unauthorized actions in their name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link or page that can cause the vulnerable application to make requests on the user's behalf.
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user into clicking on that link or page.
- No privileged access to the server is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects version 1.4.1 of `omniauth-facebook`. Versions 1.4.0 and below were not vulnerable to this specific issue, but they did not have any CSRF protection at all.
- The fix for this vulnerability was released in version 1.5.0.
- The recommended remediation is to upgrade to version 1.5.0 or later.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Egor Homakov.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-4562

The provided content gives a clear explanation of the CSRF bypass, along with the affected version, fix version, and a description of how the per-request state parameter circumvents the protection.
