{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Verizon Wireless Network Extender, specifically models SCS-26UC4 and SCS-2U01, allow local compromise via a custom HDMI cable. The root causes are a Uboot bootloader delay in SCS-26UC4, a SysReq interrupt vulnerability in SCS-2U01, and the lack of CAVE authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uboot bootloader delay allowing interruption of boot process.",
      "SysReq interrupt vulnerability allowing halting of boot process.",
      "Lack of Cellular Authentication and Voice Encryption (CAVE).",
      "Use of easily obtainable ESN and MIN for authentication.",
      "Published default root password."
    ],
    "impact": "A compromised Network Extender can be used to eavesdrop on voice, text, and data communication for mobile devices connecting to it. Additionally, the device can be used to clone subscriber phones by obtaining their ESN and MIN without direct physical access.",
    "attack_vectors": "Physical access to the device using a custom HDMI cable to gain console access.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local access to the device and the ability to create a custom HDMI cable."
