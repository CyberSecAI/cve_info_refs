# USN-1972-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

27 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Vince Weaver discovered a flaw in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel on

ARM platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4254](/security/CVE-2013-4254))

A failure to validate block numbers was discovered in the Linux kernel's

implementation of the XFS filesystem. A local user can cause a denial of

service (system crash) if they can mount, or cause to be mounted a

corrupted or special crafted XFS filesystem. ([CVE-2013-1819](/security/CVE-2013-1819))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when reading

broadcast messages from the notify\_policy interface of the IPSec

key\_socket. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially

sensitive information in kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-2237](/security/CVE-2013-2237))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-41-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-41.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-41.64)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-41-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-41.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-41.64)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-41-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-41.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-41.64)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-41-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-41.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-41.64)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-41-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-41.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-41.64)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-1968-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

27 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Vince Weaver discovered a flaw in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel on

ARM platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4254](/security/CVE-2013-4254))

A failure to validate block numbers was discovered in the Linux kernel's

implementation of the XFS filesystem. A local user can cause a denial of

service (system crash) if they can mount, or cause to be mounted a

corrupted or special crafted XFS filesystem. ([CVE-2013-1819](/security/CVE-2013-1819))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-54-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

jbd2: Fix use after free after error in jbd2\_journal\_dirty\_metadata()
commit 91aa11fae1cf8c2fd67be0609692ea9741cdcc43 upstream.
When jbd2\_journal\_dirty\_metadata() returns error,
\_\_ext4\_handle\_dirty\_metadata() stops the handle. However callers of this
function do not count with that fact and still happily used now freed
handle. This use after free can result in various issues but very likely
we oops soon.
The motivation of adding \_\_ext4\_journal\_stop() into
\_\_ext4\_handle\_dirty\_metadata() in commit 9ea7a0df seems to be only to
improve error reporting. So replace \_\_ext4\_journal\_stop() with
ext4\_journal\_abort\_handle() which was there before that commit and add
WARN\_ON\_ONCE() to dump stack to provide useful information.

m68k/atari: ARAnyM - Fix NatFeat module support
commit e8184e10f89736a23ea6eea8e24cd524c5c513d2 upstream.
As pointed out by Andreas Schwab, pointers passed to ARAnyM NatFeat calls
should be physical addresses, not virtual addresses.
Fortunately on Atari, physical and virtual kernel addresses are the same,
as long as normal kernel memory is concerned, so this usually worked fine
without conversion.
But for modules, pointers to literal strings are located in vmalloc()ed
memory. Depending on the version of ARAnyM, this causes the nf\_get\_id()
call to just fail, or worse, crash ARAnyM itself with e.g.
Gotcha! Illegal memory access. Atari PC = $968c
This is a big issue for distro kernels, who want to have all drivers as
loadable modules in an initrd.
Add a wrapper for nf\_get\_id() that copies the literal to the stack to
work around this issue.

As diagnosed by Andreas, fs/btrfs/volumes.c:\_\_btrfs\_map\_block()
calls
do\_div(stripe\_nr, stripe\_len);
with stripe\_len u64, while do\_div() assumes the divisor is a 32-bit number.
Due to the lack of truncation in the m68k-specific implementation of
do\_div(), the division is performed using the upper 32-bit word of
stripe\_len, which is zero.
This was introduced by commit 53b381b3abeb86f12787a6c40fee9b2f71edc23b
("Btrfs: RAID5 and RAID6"), which changed the divisor from
map->stripe\_len (struct map\_lookup.stripe\_len is int) to a 64-bit temporary.

ARM: 7809/1: perf: fix event validation for software group leaders
commit c95eb3184ea1a3a2551df57190c81da695e2144b upstream.
It is possible to construct an event group with a software event as a
group leader and then subsequently add a hardware event to the group.
This results in the event group being validated by adding all members
of the group to a fake PMU and attempting to allocate each event on
their respective PMU.
Unfortunately, for software events wthout a corresponding arm\_pmu, this
results in a kernel crash attempting to dereference the ->get\_event\_idx
function pointer.
This patch fixes the problem by checking explicitly for software events
and ignoring those in event validation (since they can always be
scheduled). We will probably want to revisit this for 3.12, since the
validation checks don't appear to work correctly when dealing with
multiple hardware PMUs anyway.

Fix TLB gather virtual address range invalidation corner cases
commit 2b047252d087be7f2ba088b4933cd904f92e6fce upstream.
Ben Tebulin reported:
"Since v3.7.2 on two independent machines a very specific Git
repository fails in 9/10 cases on git-fsck due to an SHA1/memory
failures. This only occurs on a very specific repository and can be
reproduced stably on two independent laptops. Git mailing list ran
out of ideas and for me this looks like some very exotic kernel issue"
and bisected the failure to the backport of commit 53a59fc67f97 ("mm:
limit mmu\_gather batching to fix soft lockups on !CONFIG\_PREEMPT").
That commit itself is not actually buggy, but what it does is to make it
much more likely to hit the partial TLB invalidation case, since it
introduces a new case in tlb\_next\_batch() that previously only ever
happened when running out of memory.
The real bug is that the TLB gather virtual memory range setup is subtly
buggered. It was introduced in commit 597e1c3580b7 ("mm/mmu\_gather:
enable tlb flush range in generic mmu\_gather"), and the range handling
was already fixed at least once in commit e6c495a96ce0 ("mm: fix the TLB
range flushed when \_\_tlb\_remove\_page() runs out of slots"), but that fix
was not complete.
The problem with the TLB gather virtual address range is that it isn't
set up by the initial tlb\_gather\_mmu() initialization (which didn't get
the TLB range information), but it is set up ad-hoc later by the
functions that actually flush the TLB. And so any such case that forgot
to update the TLB range entries would potentially miss TLB invalidates.
Rather than try to figure out exactly which particular ad-hoc range
setup was missing (I personally suspect it's the hugetlb case in
zap\_huge\_pmd(), which didn't have the same logic as zap\_pte\_range()
did), this patch just gets rid of the problem at the source: make the
TLB range information available to tlb\_gather\_mmu(), and initialize it
when initializing all the other tlb gather fields.
This makes the patch larger, but conceptually much simpler. And the end
result is much more understandable; even if you want to play games with
partial ranges when invalidating the TLB contents in chunks, now the
range information is always there, and anybody who doesn't want to
bother with it won't introduce subtle bugs.
Ben verified that this fixes his problem.

wusbcore: fix kernel panic when disconnecting a wireless USB->serial device
commit ec58fad1feb76c323ef47efff1d1e8660ed4644c upstream.
This patch fixes a kernel panic that can occur when disconnecting a
wireless USB->serial device. When the serial device disconnects, the
device cleanup procedure ends up calling usb\_hcd\_disable\_endpoint on the
serial device's endpoints. The wusbcore uses the ABORT\_RPIPE command to
abort all transfers on the given endpoint but it does not properly give
back the URBs when the transfer results return from the HWA. This patch
prevents the transfer result processing code from bailing out when it sees
a WA\_XFER\_STATUS\_ABORTED result code so that these urbs are flushed
properly by usb\_hcd\_disable\_endpoint. It also updates wa\_urb\_dequeue to
handle the case where the endpoint has already been cleaned up when
usb\_kill\_urb is called which is where the panic originally occurred.

PM / QoS: Fix workqueue deadlock when using pm\_qos\_update\_request\_timeout()
commit 40fea92ffb5fa0ef26d10ae0fe5688bc8e61c791 upstream.
pm\_qos\_update\_request\_timeout() updates a qos and then schedules
a delayed work item to bring the qos back down to the default
after the timeout. When the work item runs, pm\_qos\_work\_fn() will
call pm\_qos\_update\_request() and deadlock because it tries to
cancel itself via cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync(). Future callers of
that qos will also hang waiting to cancel the work that is
canceling itself. Let's extract the little bit of code that does
the real work of pm\_qos\_update\_request() and call it from the
work function so that we don't deadlock.
Before ed1ac6e (PM: don't use [delayed\_]work\_pending()) this didn't
happen because the work function wouldn't try to cancel itself.

USB: EHCI: accept very late isochronous URBs
commit 24f531371de17010f2b1b57d90e42240032e7733 upstream.
Since commits 4005ad4390bf (EHCI: implement new semantics for
URB\_ISO\_ASAP) and c75c5ab575af (ALSA: USB: adjust for changed 3.8 USB
API) became widely distributed, people have been experiencing problems
with audio transfers. The slightest underrun causes complete failure,
requiring the audio stream to be restarted.
It turns out that the current isochronous API doesn't handle underruns
in the best way. The ALSA developers would much rather have transfers
that are submitted too late be accepted and complete in the normal
fashion, rather than being refused outright.
This patch implements the requested approach. When an isochronous URB
submission is so late that all its scheduled slots have already
expired, a debugging message will be printed in the log and the URB
will be accepted as usual. Assuming it was submitted by a completion
handler (which is normally the case), it will complete shortly
thereafter with all the usb\_iso\_packet\_descriptor status fields marked
-EXDEV.
This fixes (for ehci-hcd)

The Tegra30 I2S driver was writing the AHUB interface parameters to the

genetlink: fix family dump race
commit 58ad436fcf49810aa006016107f494c9ac9013db upstream.
When dumping generic netlink families, only the first dump call
is locked with genl\_lock(), which protects the list of families,
and thus subsequent calls can access the data without locking,
racing against family addition/removal. This can cause a crash.
Fix it - the locking needs to be conditional because the first
time around it's already locked.
A similar bug was reported to me on an old kernel (3.4.47) but
the exact scenario that happened there is no longer possible,
on those kernels the first round wasn't locked either. Looking
at the current code I found the race described above, which had
also existed on the old kernel.

mac80211: ignore HT primary channel while connected
commit 5cdaed1e878d723d56d04ae0be1738124acf9f46 upstream.
While we're connected, the AP shouldn't change the primary channel
in the HT information. We checked this, and dropped the connection
if it did change it.
Unfortunately, this is causing problems on some APs, e.g. on the
Netgear WRT610NL: the beacons seem to always contain a bad channel
and if we made a connection using a probe response (correct data)
we drop the connection immediately and can basically not connect
properly at all.
Work around this by ignoring the HT primary channel information in
beacons if we're already connected.
Also print out more verbose messages in the other situations to
help diagnose similar bugs quicker in the future.

ARM: KVM: perform save/restore of PAR
commit 6a077e4ab9cbfbf279fb955bae05b03781c97013 upstream.
Not saving PAR is an unfortunate oversight. If the guest performs
an AT\* operation and gets scheduled out before reading the result
of the translation from PAR, it could become corrupted by another
guest or the host.
Saving this register is made slightly more complicated as KVM also
uses it on the permission fault handling path, leading to an ugly
"stash and restore" sequence. Fortunately, this is already a slow
path so we don't really care. Also, Linux doesn't do any AT\*
operation, so Linux guests are not impacted by this bug.

and strd operations in interrupts\_head.S - Christoffer ]

elevator: Fix a race in elevator switching
commit d50235b7bc3ee0a0427984d763ea7534149531b4 upstream.
There's a race between elevator switching and normal io operation.
Because the allocation of struct elevator\_queue and struct elevator\_data
don't in a atomic operation.So there are have chance to use NULL
->elevator\_data.
For example:
Thread A: Thread B
blk\_queu\_bio elevator\_switch
spin\_lock\_irq(q->queue\_block) elevator\_alloc
elv\_merge elevator\_init\_fn
Because call elevator\_alloc, it can't hold queue\_lock and the
->elevator\_data is NULL.So at the same time, threadA call elv\_merge and
nedd some info of elevator\_data.So the crash happened.
Move the elevator\_alloc into func elevator\_init\_fn, it make the
operations in a atomic operation.
Using the follow method can easy reproduce this bug
1:dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null
2:while true;do echo noop > scheduler;echo deadline > scheduler;done
The test method also use this method.

sched: Ensure update\_cfs\_shares() is called for parents of continuously-running tasks
commit bf0bd948d1682e3996adc093b43021ed391983e6 upstream.
We typically update a task\_group's shares within the dequeue/enqueue
path. However, continuously running tasks sharing a CPU are not
subject to these updates as they are only put/picked. Unfortunately,
when we reverted f269ae046 (in 17bc14b7), we lost the augmenting
periodic update that was supposed to account for this; resulting in a
potential loss of fairness.
To fix this, re-introduce the explicit update in
update\_cfs\_rq\_blocked\_load() [called via entity\_tick()].

fs/proc/task\_mmu.c: fix buffer overflow in add\_page\_map()
commit 8c8296223f3abb142be8fc31711b18a704c0e7d8 upstream.
Recently we met quite a lot of random kernel panic issues after enabling
CONFIG\_PROC\_PAGE\_MONITOR. After debuggind we found this has something
to do with following bug in pagemap:
In struct pagemapread:
struct pagemapread {
int pos, len;
pagemap\_entry\_t \*buffer;
bool v2;
};
pos is number of PM\_ENTRY\_BYTES in buffer, but len is the size of
buffer, it is a mistake to compare pos and len in add\_page\_map() for
checking buffer is full or not, and this can lead to buffer overflow and
random kernel panic issue.
Correct len to be total number of PM\_ENTRY\_BYTES in buffer.

When the stack is set to unlimited, the bottomup direction is used for

ASLR for mmapings along with PIE useless.

microblaze: fix clone syscall
commit dfa9771a7c4784bafd0673bc7abcee3813088b77 upstream.
Fix inadvertent breakage in the clone syscall ABI for Microblaze that
was introduced in commit f3268edbe6fe ("microblaze: switch to generic
fork/vfork/clone").
The Microblaze syscall ABI for clone takes the parent tid address in the
4th argument; the third argument slot is used for the stack size. The
incorrectly-used CLONE\_BACKWARDS type assigned parent tid to the 3rd
slot.
This commit restores the original ABI so that existing userspace libc
code will work correctly.

perf/x86: Fix intel QPI uncore event definitions
commit c9601247f8f3fdc18aed7ed7e490e8dfcd07f122 upstream.
John McCalpin reports that the "drs\_data" and "ncb\_data" QPI
uncore events are missing the "extra bit" and always return zero
values unless the bit is properly set.
More details from him:
According to the Xeon E5-2600 Product Family Uncore Performance
Monitoring Guide, Table 2-94, about 1/2 of the QPI Link Layer events
(including the ones that "perf" calls "drs\_data" and "ncb\_data") require
that the "extra bit" be set.
This was confusing for a while -- a note at the bottom of page 94 says
that the "extra bit" is bit 16 of the control register.
Unfortunately, Table 2-86 clearly says that bit 16 is reserved and must
be zero. Looking around a bit, I found that bit 21 appears to be the
correct "extra bit", and further investigation shows that "perf" actually
agrees with me:
[root@c560-003.stampede]# cat /sys/bus/event\_source/devices/uncore\_qpi\_0/format/event
config:0-7,21
So the command
# perf -e "uncore\_qpi\_0/event=drs\_data/"
Is the same as
# perf -e "uncore\_qpi\_0/event=0x02,umask=0x08/"
While it should be
# perf -e "uncore\_qpi\_0/event=0x102,umask=0x08/"
I confirmed that this last version gives results that agree with the
amount of data that I expected the STREAM benchmark to move across the QPI
link in the second (cross-chip) test of the original script.

# USN-1973-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

27 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Vince Weaver discovered a flaw in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel on

ARM platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4254](/security/CVE-2013-4254))

A failure to validate block numbers was discovered in the Linux kernel's

implementation of the XFS filesystem. A local user can cause a denial of

service (system crash) if they can mount, or cause to be mounted a

corrupted or special crafted XFS filesystem. ([CVE-2013-1819](/security/CVE-2013-1819))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when reading

broadcast messages from the notify\_policy interface of the IPSec

key\_socket. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially

sensitive information in kernel memory.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-233-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-233.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-233.49)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-1971-1: Linux kernel (Raring HWE) vulnerabilities

27 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-raring](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-raring) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Raring

## Details

Vince Weaver discovered a flaw in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel on

ARM platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4254](/security/CVE-2013-4254))

A memory leak was discovered in the user namespace facility of the Linux

kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (memory consumption)

via the CLONE\_NEWUSER unshare call. ([CVE-2013-4205](/security/CVE-2013-4205))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-31-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-31.46~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-31.46~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=998878#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-08-20 09:34:20 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built for the ARM(CONFIG_ARM/CONFIG_ARM64) platforms along with the hardware performance counter support(CONFIG_HW_PERF_EVENTS) is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw. This could lead to the kernel crash resulting in DoS or potential privilege escalation to gain root privileges by a non-root user.

# USN-1975-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

27 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Vince Weaver discovered a flaw in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel on

ARM platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4254](/security/CVE-2013-4254))

A failure to validate block numbers was discovered in the Linux kernel's

implementation of the XFS filesystem. A local user can cause a denial of

service (system crash) if they can mount, or cause to be mounted a

corrupted or special crafted XFS filesystem. ([CVE-2013-1819](/security/CVE-2013-1819))

### Reduce your security exposure

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-233-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-233.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-233.49)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when reading

broadcast messages from the notify\_policy interface of the IPSec

key\_socket. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially

sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2237](/security/CVE-2013-2237))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ARM: 7809/1: perf: fix event validation for software group leaders

```
It is possible to construct an event group with a software event as a
group leader and then subsequently add a hardware event to the group.
This results in the event group being validated by adding all members
of the group to a fake PMU and attempting to allocate each event on
their respective PMU.

Unfortunately, for software events wthout a corresponding arm_pmu, this
results in a kernel crash attempting to dereference the ->get_event_idx
function pointer.

This patch fixes the problem by checking explicitly for software events
and ignoring those in event validation (since they can always be
scheduled). We will probably want to revisit this for 3.12, since the
validation checks don't appear to work correctly when dealing with
multiple hardware PMUs anyway.
