Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-4340:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient checks when processing user input during post creation. Specifically, a user with the "Author" role could manipulate the request to set the post's author to another user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Privilege Escalation: An "Author" role user could create a post attributed to another user. This violates the intended access controls and allows for potential misrepresentation and abuse.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with "Author" privileges could create posts appearing to be written by other users. This could damage reputations, spread misinformation, or facilitate other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request made by an authenticated user with the "Author" role.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an account with at least "Author" role privileges on the affected WordPress site. They also need to be able to craft a specific HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves ignoring the user ID post data to prevent manipulation and ensure the current user is always the author of the post they create, unless an override is specifically permitted.
- The vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 3.6.1
