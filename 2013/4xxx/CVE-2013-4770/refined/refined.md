- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A sandbox-bypass vulnerability in AngularJS, a web application framework used by the Eucalyptus Management Console (EMC), combined with a lack of proper output encoding in some parts of the EMC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to privilege escalation or complete compromise of the cloud.
- **Attack vectors:** Cloud users can inject malicious JavaScript code through the EMC due to inadequate output encoding, taking advantage of the AngularJS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a cloud user with access to the Eucalyptus Management Console.
