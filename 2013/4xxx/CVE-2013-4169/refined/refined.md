Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-4169:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use (TOCTTOU) race condition existed in the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) when handling the X server sockets directory (`/tmp/.X11-unix`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** GDM would check for the existence of the `/tmp/.X11-unix` directory and create it if it was missing. An attacker could exploit the time between the check and the creation by manipulating the directory.
- **Symbolic Link Attack:** An unprivileged user could create a symbolic link at `/tmp/.X11-unix` pointing to another file or directory. When GDM created the directory, it would overwrite the symbolic link with an actual directory, giving the attacker write access to the target of the symbolic link.
- **Insecure Permissions:** GDM would change the ownership of `/tmp/.X11-unix` to root and set the permissions to 1777. By creating the symbolic link beforehand, the attacker could force GDM to perform these operations on the target of the symlink instead, potentially overwriting root-owned files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By exploiting the race condition and the insecure creation of the directory, an unprivileged user could gain write access to arbitrary files on the system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By overwriting files owned by root, the attacker could escalate their privileges to root.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An unprivileged user on the system with the ability to create symbolic links in `/tmp`.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was mitigated by:
    - Removing the vulnerable code from GDM that was responsible for creating the `/tmp/.X11-unix` directory.
    - Modifying the `initscripts` package to create the directory safely during the system boot process, preventing GDM from needing to create it.

**Additional Notes:**
- Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2013:1213 was released to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability only affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was not affected as it does not create the directory.
- The fix requires a system reboot to take effect.
- The vulnerability was reported by a researcher with the nickname vladz.
