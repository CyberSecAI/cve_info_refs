| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=911122#c0)  Florian Weimer    2013-02-14 12:41:13 UTC  ``` In InfraStack/OSDependent/Linux/InfraStackModules/TraceModule/TraceModule.c, function Trace_OpenLogFile, the log file (typically /var/log/wimax/wimaxd.log) is chmod'ed to 0666.  Log files should not be world-writable.  I'm not sure if this log file should even be world-readable (see [bug 911121](show_bug.cgi?id=911121 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2013-4217 wimax (OSAL crypt module): By setting encrypted password writes unencrypted passwords to log files")).  It's probably best to restrict permissions on the /var/log/wimax directory, too.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=911122#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-08 14:45:39 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way Trace module of WiMAX, an user space daemon for the Intel 2400m Wireless WiMAX link, used to set permissions when opening the log file (was created with world-readable / writable permissions). A local attacker could use this flaw to, in an unauthorized way, alter the content of WiMAX daemon log file (possibly leading to un-enforced actions to be performed by system administrator).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=911122#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-08 16:45:20 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was found by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=911122#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-08 16:47:14 UTC  ```  Created wimax tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 995160](show_bug.cgi?id=995160 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2013-4216 CVE-2013-4217 CVE-2013-4218 CVE-2013-4219 wimax: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=911122#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-08 16:56:43 UTC  ``` CVE Request:   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/08/08/10>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=911122#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 07:19:29 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2013-4216](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4216) has been assigned to this issue:   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/08/08/17>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=911122#c9)  Florian Weimer    2015-02-17 16:48:27 UTC  ``` Only Fedora 19 shipped the wimax packages, and it is now EOL.   ``` |  |
