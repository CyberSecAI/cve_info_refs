      "weaknesses": [
        "The `virtio_net_load()` function does not properly validate the `in_use` variable, which controls the number of MAC addresses to load. This allows an attacker to supply a large value for `in_use`, which, when multiplied by the size of a MAC address, results in a read beyond the bounds of the `mac_table.macs` buffer."
