| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1027052#c0)  David Jorm    2013-11-06 02:04:31 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way Nuxeo RichFaces handled deserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending on the deserialization logic of these classes. On Nuxeo Server 5.6, 5.7.4 and 5.8, this can be used to trigger deserialization logic which leads to unauthenticated remote code execution.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1027052#c1)  David Jorm    2013-11-06 02:06:29 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This flaw does not affect RichFaces as shipped with various JBoss products. These products use JBoss RichFaces, which is covered by [CVE-2013-2165](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2165). This flaw pertains specifically to Nuxeo RichFaces.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1027052#c2)  David Jorm    2013-11-08 00:16:12 UTC  ``` Upstream patch commit:  <https://github.com/nuxeo/richfaces/commit/6cbad2a6dcb70d3e33a6ce5879b1a3ad79eb1aec>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1027052#c3)  Murray McAllister    2013-11-08 00:23:17 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Arun Neelicattu and David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response Team.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1027052#c4)  David Jorm    2013-11-14 00:42:47 UTC  ``` Upstream advisory:  [http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/public/ADMINDOC58/Nuxeo+Security+HotFix](http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/public/ADMINDOC58/Nuxeo%2BSecurity%2BHotFix) <https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/hotfixes/cap-5.8>   ``` |  |

## Description

RichFaces implementation in Nuxeo Platform 5.6.0 before HF27 and 5.8.0 before HF-01 does not restrict the classes for which deserialization methods can be called, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted serialized data. NOTE: this vulnerability may overlap [CVE-2013-2165](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4344-frcp-j22q "CVE-2013-2165").
