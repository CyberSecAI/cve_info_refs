Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-4861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the VeraLite's `get_file.sh` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The `get_file.sh` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically, the `filename` parameter) before using it to construct file paths. This allows an attacker to include `../` sequences to traverse directories and access files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read the content of any file on the system, such as `/etc/passwd`.
- **Information Disclosure:** Reading the `/etc/passwd` file reveals hashed root passwords and potentially tech support remote access passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted GET request to the `get_file.sh` script on the VeraLite's web interface.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The `filename` parameter within the URL is modified to include directory traversal sequences (e.g. `../../../../../etc/passwd`).
- **Internet-based control panel:** The attack can also be launched through the Internet-based control panel at cp.mios.com when logged in as either an admin or guest level account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the VeraLite device. This could be over the local network or through the internet based control panel.
- An attacker can be a guest level or admin level user via the internet based control panel at cp.mios.com

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory mentions that on a freshly unboxed VeraLite the attack won't work, however the attacker can use the store_file.sh to create the directory necessary for the exploit to work.
- The vulnerability allows retrieving the content of any file on the system.
