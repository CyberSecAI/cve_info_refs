  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2013-4149",
    "description": "QEMU 1.3.0 out-of-bounds buffer write in virtio_net_load()@hw/net/virtio-net.c. The code allocates a buffer of size n->mac_table.in_use, but reads n->mac_table.in_use * ETH_ALEN bytes into it, which causes a buffer overflow.",
    "affected_component": "virtio-net driver",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient size validation when loading the mac table during migration or loading a saved VM state.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds buffer write"
    ],
    "impact": "A user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "attack_vector": "By providing crafted savevm data, either through a malicious disk image or a crafted migration stream.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the saved VM state, either by providing a malicious disk image or intercepting and modifying the migration stream.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `virtio_net_load` function within the `hw/net/virtio-net.c` file. The code allocates a buffer based on `n->mac_table.in_use` but then uses this value multiplied by `ETH_ALEN` (which is 6) when reading the data, leading to a buffer overflow."
