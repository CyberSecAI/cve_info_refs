=== Content from subversion.apache.org_563bd344_20250125_190306.html ===
 Subversion HTTP servers up to 1.8.0 (inclusive) are vulnerable
to a remotely triggerable "Assertion failed" DoS vulnerability or read
overflow.
Summary:
========
Subversion's mod\_dav\_svn Apache HTTPD server module will trigger an assertion
on some requests made against a revision root. This can lead to a DoS.
If assertions are disabled it will trigger a read overflow which may cause a
SEGFAULT (or equivalent) or undefined behavior.
Commit access is required to exploit this.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.7.0 through 1.7.10 (inclusive).
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.8.0 (including 1.8.0 release candidates).
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.8.1
Subversion 1.7.11
svnserve (any version) is not vulnerable.
Subversion 1.6.x is not vulnerable.
Details:
========
The vulnerability can be triggered in two ways. The first way requires
that the Subversion server runs Apache HTTPD 2.2.25 or later or Apache HTTPD
2.4.5 or later. When running under those versions of Apache HTTPD, the
vulnerability can be triggered by making a COPY request against a revision
root. The following Subversion operation generates such a request:
% svn cp -mm ^/ ^/foo
With any version of Apache HTTPD, the vulnerability may be triggered by
making a DELETE HTTP request against a revision root, a MOVE HTTP request
whose source or destination is a revision root, or a COPY HTTP request whose
destination is a revision root. These requests are not part of any valid
Subversion operation.
Making a copy of the repository root is a valid Subversion operation.
However, a code change in Apache HTTPD 2.2.25/2.4.5 led to a codepath being
exercised for a revision root that was never before executed for a revision
root. That code performs a hand-rolled path arithmetic instead of using the
internal path manipulation library, and thus passes an invalid path down to
a library function which runs an assert() validation on that path.
When assertions are enabled, the validation fails and kills the httpd
process. When assertions are disabled, code would read beyond allocated
memory, which may lead to a segfault or undefined behavior.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 4
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P
How bad the impact of that is varies based upon several environmental
configuration details. Specifically whether assertions were enabled at
build time and what MPM mode Apache httpd is using.
When assertions are enabled (defaults to on for \*nix systems and off for
Windows) then the assertion will prevent any undefined behavior, at the cost
of a causing the http server process to abort. Apache httpd servers using a
prefork MPM will simply start a new process to replace the process that
died. Servers using threaded MPMs may be processing other requests in the
same process as the process that the attack causes to die. In either case
there is an increased processing impact of restarting a process and the cost
of per process caches being lost.
When assertions are disabled a read overflow will occur. This may cause a
segfault. However, it may also simply read into other memory that was
allocated and as a result the precise behavior of Subversion is partially
undefined. Subversion may accept or reject the request when it should not
do so based on locks, "If:" http headers or ETags. We have not found any
cases where the contents of the memory that has been read into will be
leaked to the client or into the repository.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.8.1 or 1.7.11.
Users who are unable to upgrade may apply the included patches.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
We remind users that we recommend upgrading Apache HTTPD to 2.2.25 (for
repositories served by HTTPD) due to an independent security issue fixed
in that HTTPD release: CVE-2013-1896. See  for
details about CVE-2013-1896, including a recommendation for those who serve
Subversion repositories with Apache HTTPD 2.4.x.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=986194#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-19 08:12:38 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way mod_dav_svn module of Subversion (SVN), a concurrent version control system, used to process certain MOVE, COPY, or DELETE HTTP requests (requests that originated or targeted against a revision root). A remote attacker, with commit access / privileges could use this flaw to cause denial of service (depending on the Apache httpd web server configuration either child assertion failure or crash [prefork MPM configuration] or failure to handle other requests, originally scheduled to be handled within the same thread [threaded MPM configuration] due to a process termination) by issuing a specially-crafted SVN commit request.  Vulnerable package versions: * Subversion HTTPD servers 1.7.0 through 1.7.10 (inclusive) * Subversion HTTPD servers 1.8.0 (including 1.8.0 release candidates). * svnserve (any version) is not vulnerable. * Subversion 1.6.x is not vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=986194#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-19 08:16:03 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the subversion package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the subversion package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17, 18, and 19.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=986194#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-19 08:17:57 UTC  ```  Statement:  Not vulnerable.
