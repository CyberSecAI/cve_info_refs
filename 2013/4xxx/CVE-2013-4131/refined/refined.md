{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the `mod_dav_svn` module of Subversion when handling certain MOVE, COPY, or DELETE HTTP requests against a revision root. A code change in Apache HTTPD 2.2.25/2.4.5 caused a code path to be executed for a revision root that was not executed before. This code performs hand-rolled path arithmetic instead of using the internal path manipulation library, leading to an invalid path passed to a library function, causing an assertion failure or a read overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect path canonicalization",
      "Hand-rolled path arithmetic instead of using the internal path manipulation library",
       "Read overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). When assertions are enabled, the httpd process aborts. With threaded MPMs, other requests being processed in the same process may be impacted. When assertions are disabled, a read overflow occurs which can lead to a segfault or undefined behavior. The server may become unstable and unresponsive. In some cases, Subversion might incorrectly accept or reject requests.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Making a COPY request against a revision root (when running Apache HTTPD 2.2.25 or later or Apache HTTPD 2.4.5 or later).",
      "Making a DELETE HTTP request against a revision root.",
      "Making a MOVE HTTP request where the source or destination is a revision root.",
      "Making a COPY HTTP request where the destination is a revision root."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Commit access/privileges to the Subversion repository is required to exploit the vulnerability."
