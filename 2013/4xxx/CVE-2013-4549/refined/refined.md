Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-4549

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of XML entity expansion within the QXmlSimpleReader component of the Qt framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML Entity Expansion:** The core weakness lies in the insufficient limitations on the depth and breadth of XML entity references during parsing. This allows an attacker to craft malicious XML documents that, when parsed by Qt, could result in excessive resource consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition. By providing specially crafted XML input with nested or widely expanded entity references, an attacker can force the vulnerable Qt application to use excessive CPU and memory. The application can become unresponsive or crash, denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Input:** The attack vector involves providing a Qt application with a malicious XML document. This can be achieved through various means where the application parses XML data, including user-supplied XML files, network-based XML data, or XML data from external sources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide XML Data:** The attacker needs the capability to provide or manipulate the XML input that a vulnerable Qt application processes. This could be by controlling an upstream data source that the application relies on or by directly providing malicious XML through an application interface.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content indicates that the vulnerability affects both Qt4 and Qt5.
- Patches were released to address the vulnerability by limiting the depth and breadth of entity expansions.
- Multiple Linux distributions (openSUSE, Ubuntu) issued security updates to address this issue.
- The vulnerability is described as "moderate" in severity.

In summary, CVE-2013-4549 is an XML Entity Expansion vulnerability in Qt that allows for denial-of-service attacks via specially crafted XML input.
