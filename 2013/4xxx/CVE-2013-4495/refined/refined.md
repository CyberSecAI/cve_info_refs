Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-4495

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `torque` batch processing system handles the `-M` switch within the `qsub` command. Specifically, user-supplied commands appended to the `-M` switch were not properly sanitized. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization, leading to command injection. User-provided input was directly passed into a pipe, enabling the execution of arbitrary shell commands.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software failed to validate or sanitize the input provided through the `-M` switch of `qsub`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A malicious user could execute arbitrary code as root on the `pbs_server`. This would grant the attacker full control of the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the `qsub` command, a component of the torque system.
- **User-Initiated:** The attacker needs to submit a job via `qsub` and use the `-M` option to pass the malicious commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Access:** An attacker needs to be a user of the `torque` system with the ability to submit jobs using `qsub`.
- **Command knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft and append malicious commands to the `-M` switch.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `torque` batch processing system.
- The issue was reported by Matt Ezell from Oak Ridge National Labs.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of torque, and has been fixed in:
    - `2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze3` (squeeze)
    - `2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u2` (wheezy)
    - `2.4.16+dfsg-1.3` (sid)
- The issue is described as a remote code execution vulnerability.
- The fix involves sanitizing user input passed via the -M switch to qsub.
