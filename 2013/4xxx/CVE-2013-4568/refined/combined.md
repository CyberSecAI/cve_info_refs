How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.21.3, 1.20.8 and
1.19.9. These releases fix 2 security related bugs that could affect users
of MediaWiki. Download links are given at the end of this email.

\* Kevin Israel (Wikipedia user PleaseStand) identified and reported two
vectors for injecting Javascript in CSS that bypassed MediaWiki's blacklist
(CVE-2013-4567, CVE-2013-4568).
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55332>

\* Internal review while debugging a site issue discovered that MediaWiki
and the CentralNotice extension were incorrectly setting cache headers when
a user was autocreated, causing the user's session cookies to be cached,
and returned to other users (CVE-2013-4572).
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53032>

Additionally, the following extensions have been updated to fix security
issues:

\* CleanChanges: MediaWiki steward Teles reported that revision-deleted IP's
are not correctly hidden when this extension is used (CVE-2013-4569).
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54294>

\* ZeroRatedMobileAccess: Tomasz Chlebowski reported an XSS vulnerability
(CVE-2013-4573).
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55991>

\* CentralAuth: MediaWiki developer Platonides reported a login CSRF in
CentralAuth (CVE-2012-5394).
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40747>

Debian Bug     : 729629 706601 742857 742857

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in MediaWiki, a wiki engine.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project describers the followin
issues:

CVE-2013-2031

    Cross-site scripting attack via valid UTF-7 encoded sequences
    in a SVG file.

CVE-2013-4567 & CVE-2013-4568

    Kevin Israel (Wikipedia user PleaseStand) reported two ways
    to inject Javascript due to an incomplete blacklist in the
    CSS sanitizer function.

CVE-2013-4572

    MediaWiki and the CentralNotice extension were incorrectly setting
    cache headers when a user was autocreated, causing the user's
    session cookies to be cached, and returned to other users.

CVE-2013-6452

    Chris from RationalWiki reported that SVG files could be
    uploaded that include external stylesheets, which could lead to
    XSS when an XSL was used to include JavaScript.

CVE-2013-6453

    MediaWiki's SVG sanitization could be bypassed when the XML was
    considered invalid.

CVE-2013-6454

    MediaWiki's CSS sanitization did not filter -o-link attributes,
    which could be used to execute JavaScript in Opera 12.

CVE-2013-6472

    MediaWiki displayed some information about deleted pages in
    the log API, enhanced RecentChanges, and user watchlists.

CVE-2014-1610

    A remote code execution vulnerability existed if file upload
    support for DjVu (natively handled) or PDF files (in
    combination with the PdfHandler extension) was enabled.
    Neither file type is enabled by default in MediaWiki.

(ID assignment pending)

    Cross site request forgery in login form: an attacker could login
    a victim as the attacker.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.19.14+dfsg-0+deb7u1 of the mediawiki package and 3.5~deb7u1
of the mediawiki-extensions package.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.19.14+dfsg-1 of the mediawiki package and 3.5 of the
mediawiki-extensions package.

We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.

# Description

I was reviewing gerrit 87648 and happened to find this vulnerability

in the existing code. The patch looks like it might fix the vulnerability (provided, of course, that all callers filter out unescaped vertical tabs), though I'm not sure whether that was the author's intent.

So it's possible that others already know about this vulnerability.

To reproduce (works in at least Firefox and Chromium), paste this wikitext in the edit box and hit Preview:

<p style="font-size: 100px; background-image: url\b([https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo6w.png)">A</p>](https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo6w.png%29%22%3EA%3C/p%3E)

Actual Result: Logo is loaded from Google server and displayed

Expected Result: Logo should not be loaded from Google server or displayed. CSS should become /\* insecure input \*/.

---

**Version**: unspecified

**Severity**: normal

It's worth noting that this may allow XSS (using things like behavior, -moz-binding, and JavaScript URLs), and also that there are many other ways to bypass blacklists like this one. For example, the following (adapted from <http://html5sec.org/#css>) works against IE 6:

<p style="font-size: 100px; color: ｅｘｐｒｅｓｓｉｏｎ((title='XSSed'),'red')">B</p>

Note that the property name "expression" is written in fullwidth characters.

On that page I also notice a couple properties -o-link and pointer-events that aren't blacklisted either.

Fullwidth characters are characters like U+FF45 U+FF58 U+FF50 U+FF52 ...

I don't know why I wrote "property name" when "expression" isn't one.

And to further illustrate,

<p style="font-size: 100px; color: expʀessɪoɴ((title='XSSed'),'red')">B</p>

(using other characters such as U+0280 LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL R,

as adapted from <http://trac.edgewall.org/browser/trunk/trac/util/tests/html.py>)

also works in IE 6.

Note: The "\b" attack only seems to work when $wgUseTidy = true; the "fullwidth" and "small caps" attacks against IE 6 work regardless of the $wgUseTidy setting.

Thanks Kevin. I knew our blacklist was missing a couple of properties, but I wasn't aware of the full-width characters or the \b. I'll start working up a patch for those next week. Please let us know if you find any other injections that get past that filter.

Check for vertical tabs, fullwidth, and ipa unicode

*attachment bug55332.patch ignored as obsolete*

[• csteipp](/p/csteipp/) added a comment.[Oct 8 2013, 11:31 PM2013-10-08 23:31:07 (UTC+0)](#634423)Comment Actions

This patch should allow us to detect a url when it's followed by a vertical tab, as well as checking for the Fullwidth and IPA unicode attacks on IE6. Parser tests added too, based on the ones from <http://trac.edgewall.org/browser/trunk/trac/util/tests/html.py>

For the -o-link properties, Opera 11+ only allows those on <a> elements, which MediaWiki doesn't allow a way to create with styles. So it would only affect Opera 7-10, which seems to be a tiny fraction of our traffic[0]. I'm not sure if we ever have legitimate uses of that property-- if not, we can add it to the "/\* insecure input \*/" blacklist.

I found a few ways to get around the patch (attachment 13452). Also note that PHP 5.2.3 (the MW 1.19 minimum requirement) does not support closures.

### Superscript and subscript parentheses (IE 6)

```
<p style="font-size: 100px; background-image:url{CHAR}https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo6w.png)">A</p>
```

Replace {CHAR} with one of:

* U+207D SUPERSCRIPT LEFT PARENTHESIS
* U+208D SUBSCRIPT LEFT PARENTHESIS

### Various marks that repeat the S in expression (IE 6)

```
<p style="font-size: 100px; color: expres{CHAR}ion((title='XSSed'),'red')">B</p>
```

Replace {CHAR} with one of:

* U+3031 VERTICAL KANA REPEAT MARK
* U+309D HIRAGANA ITERATION MARK
* U+30FC KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK
* U+30FD KATAKANA ITERATION MARK
* U+FE7C ARABIC SHADDA ISOLATED FORM
* U+FE7D ARABIC SHADDA MEDIAL FORM
* U+FF70 HALFWIDTH KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK

### Everything except url( and expression (when $wgUseTidy is true)

No check for vertical tab there. Actually, the vertical tab is illegal in XML, and this function should probably not allow anything that is.

```
<div style="font-size: 100px; width: 200px; filter\b:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo6w.png');">C</div>
```

Though this actually can affect IE 6 even when $wgUseTidy = false;

Did you find those from a list of symbols that IE6 transliterates? Or are you finding these by testing? Since we're (for now) blacklisting, we do want to make sure we get them all. I'd like to rework our css handling to not use inline, and use something like htmlpurify to whitelist, but that's a long ways off.

I'll add it to the forbidden control chars.

By testing, so there are probably some I missed (in particular, I did not check for anything above U+FFFF). My test script replaced each of the characters with the HTML escape codes for everything in U+0000..U+FFFF. It did not replace more than one character at a time.

Furthermore, my test script seemed to give some false positives (e.g. even though I used <!DOCTYPE html>, the script reported that the equals sign could be substituted for the colon).

I ran your script under ie4linux'es version of ie6, and got back a lot more characters that were valid substitutions for expression. I verified that it gave a popup for each of these.

So here are the test cases I'm working against, although this is missing U+008A, U+009A, U+008C and U+009C, since I can't find a way to get those inserted into the input field in Chrome. I'll get a patch in shortly.

(First of all, not everything marked "x:" is substituting for X.)

What you have looks like a pretty good match to the bestfit1251.txt and bestfit1252.txt lists (from <http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/WindowsBestFit/>) combined, though I haven't checked in detail.

It's odd that the superscript and subscript parentheses aren't in that list though they worked for me on a Windows XP VM (the one from the Microsoft site modern.ie). And outside the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block, out of these, only U+207F seemed to be a problem on a real Windows XP installation (that isn't to say nobody else is running IE6 using Wine though). I suspect IE6 is using some Windows string function that is implemented differently in Wine.

I did make the code change the color instead of open an alert box to prevent endless alerting, though it didn't seem to make a difference; I just saw the same code points over and over again.

Alright, I think we should use the modern.ie list, since that should be a fully updated version of IE6. If someone is using an out of date version, I don't think we should be going too far out of our way to help them... they will have worse problems.

A call to WideCharToMultiByte() with CodePage=CP\_ACP and dwFlags not containing

WC\_NO\_BEST\_FIT\_CHARS would have this effect. I haven't identified the exact caller responsible, but such calls do seem to be common in IE.

[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd374130%28v=vs.85%29.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd374130%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx)

"CP\_ACP The system default Windows ANSI code page.

"Note This value can be different on different computers, even on the same network. It can be changed on the same computer, leading to stored data becoming irrecoverably corrupted. This value is only intended for temporary use and permanent storage should use UTF-16 or UTF-8 if possible."

Presumably CP1252 is most commonly used for CP\_ACP, in which case bestfit1252.txt would be an appropriate reference.

Sorry, obviously bestfit1252.txt doesn't explain U+309D etc., and I've confirmed that Kevin's script shows U+309D as an issue on my Windows XP VM. Also, if it was plain CP1252 conversion, you would expect U+2320 and a few others to come up, which they don't. Maybe it is some sort of Unicode normalization step followed by CP1252 conversion.

I haven't gotten any further with my disassembly, so it's hard to know if the patch is comprehensive. But given the small number of trusted users using IE6, I think it is good enough to release.
