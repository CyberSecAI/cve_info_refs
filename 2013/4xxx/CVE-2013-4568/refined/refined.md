Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-4568:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an incomplete blacklist in the CSS sanitization function of MediaWiki. The sanitization was intended to prevent the injection of Javascript through CSS, however, multiple methods were found to bypass it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Blacklist:** The CSS sanitization function used a blacklist approach, which is inherently prone to bypasses. The blacklist failed to account for:
    *   Vertical tab characters (`\v`, ASCII 11) within URLs, allowing the injection of malicious URLs.
    *   Non-ASCII characters (full-width, IPA, superscript, subscript, and other similar characters) that could be interpreted by Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) as valid characters for the "expression" property. This could be used to inject arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   Character substitutions/transliterations: IE6 was found to substitute other Unicode characters for characters within the "expression" keyword, leading to successful JavaScript injection.
    *   Filter bypass using comments: The sanitization was found to not strip comments before checking for the "expression" keyword.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript into CSS, which would then be executed in the browsers of users viewing the affected pages, leading to XSS.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (IE6):**  In the case of IE6, successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution by injecting Javascript using the `expression()` property or similar.
*  **Information Disclosure:** CSS injection could be used to potentially reveal sensitive information via exfiltration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wikitext Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious CSS code through wikitext, specifically within the `style` attribute of HTML elements.
*   **CSS Input:**  Any part of MediaWiki that processed and rendered user-supplied CSS could be used as an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Editor Access:** The attacker needs to be able to edit pages on the MediaWiki instance to insert malicious wikitext/CSS. This typically means they would need to be logged in with some level of editor permissions.
*   **Knowledge of Bypass Techniques:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific bypass techniques, like using vertical tabs or character substitutions, to circumvent the blacklist.
*  **Target User Interaction:**  The targeted user must view the page containing the malicious CSS.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability is present in MediaWiki versions 1.19, 1.20, and 1.21, and patches were released to fix the issues.
* The vulnerability was demonstrated to affect multiple browsers, and specifically Internet Explorer 6 due to the way it handles characters.
* The vulnerability report also highlighted the limitations of using a blacklist approach for CSS sanitization, recommending instead whitelisting or other sanitization techniques.
