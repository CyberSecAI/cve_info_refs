Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4582:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input within the gitlab-shell component when handling git commands. Specifically, the `gitlab_projects.rb` script, which handles git commands related to project management, does not properly sanitize the arguments provided to `git` commands. This allows an attacker to inject malicious parameters into the `git` commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to include the contents of local files by injecting filenames into git commands, like `git clone`.  By controlling the path within these git commands, an attacker can force the server to read and potentially disclose content from arbitrary files on the server's filesystem by including those files in repository metadata

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read any file on the GitLab server's filesystem, which could include sensitive configuration files, source code, or database credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **GitLab Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the GitLab web interface when a user performs operations related to Git repositories.  Specifically, the attack occurs when a git command is constructed on the server using unsanitized user input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated GitLab User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the GitLab server.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability resides in the following methods within `/home/git/gitlab-shell/lib/gitlab_projects.rb`:

*   `create_branch`
*   `create_tag`
*   `import_project`
*   `fork_project`

These methods used to construct `git` commands using unsanitized input, for example:
```ruby
cmd = %W(git clone --bare #{@source} #{full_path})
```
The provided patch introduces `--` to separate the git command from the arguments
```ruby
 cmd = %W(git clone --bare -- #{@source} #{full_path})
```

This prevents an attacker from injecting additional parameters into the git command via the `@source` variable.
