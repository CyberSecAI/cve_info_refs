  "CVE-2013-4541": {
    "description": "Multiple buffer overflow, input validation, and out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the virtio, virtio-net, virtio-scsi, and usb drivers of QEMU handled state loading after migration. A user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient sanity checking of `setup_index + setup_len` in the USB post_load function.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Input Validation",
      "Out-of-bounds Write"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Altering savevm data on disk",
      "Altering savevm data over the wire during migration"
    ],
