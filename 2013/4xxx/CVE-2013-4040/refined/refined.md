The provided content is related to CVE-2013-4040.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to overly permissive file permissions on TADDM files on UNIX-like servers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is caused by TADDM installation not setting restricted permissions on TADDM files on UNIX-like servers, which allows unauthorized access to sensitive files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is not explicitly specified, but it can be inferred that if an attacker gains unauthorized access to TADDM files, they may be able to potentially access sensitive information, modify TADDM configurations, or cause other disruptions.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining access to the TADDM server through a compromised user account, by exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access, or by taking advantage of the overly permissive file permissions on the TADDM server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to have access to the TADDM server's file system to exploit this vulnerability. This could involve compromising a user account on the server, exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access, or being a user with excessive permissions.
