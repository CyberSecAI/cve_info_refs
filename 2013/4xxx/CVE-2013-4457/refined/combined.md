Subject: Recursive Interpolation Vulnerability in Cocaine rubygem (CVE-2013-4457)

Recursive Interpolation Vulnerability in Cocaine rubygem

There is a vulnerability interpolating variabled recursively in Cocaine. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-4457

Versions Affected:  0.4.x, 0.5.1, 0.5.2
Not affected:       0.3.x
Fixed Versions:     0.5.3

Impact
------

Due to the method of variable interpolation in Cocaine 0.4.0 to 0.5.2, an attacker may be able to inject hostile commands into a command line via a crafted hash object which are not properly escaped.

The impact is lessened on Ruby version 1.8.* because hashed are not ordered by default, and so an attacker must rely on luck for the attack to work.

An attack of this sort cannot take place if there is only one value being interpolated into the command line.

Users of the Paperclip gem are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of Cocaine. Users of the 2.7 branch of Paperclip will not need to upgrade as the version of Cocaine it uses is not vulnerable to this attack.

Releases
--------
Version 0.5.3 fixes the problem involved and is available at rubygems.org

Credits
-------

Thanks to Holger Just for reporting this!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
