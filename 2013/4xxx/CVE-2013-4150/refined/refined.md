{
  "cveId": "CVE-2013-4150",
  "related": true,
  "information": {
    "rootCause": "An out-of-bounds buffer write vulnerability exists in the `virtio_net_load()` function within the `hw/net/virtio-net.c` file of QEMU. This vulnerability occurs when loading state data during migration.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds buffer write"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can control the savevm data (either from disk or during migration) can corrupt the QEMU process memory on the destination host, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Manipulating savevm data on disk",
      "Manipulating savevm data during migration"
    ],
     "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to alter the savevm data, either on the disk or over the wire during migration.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `curr_queues` value is greater than the allocated size of the `vqs` array. Specifically, the following code section is vulnerable:  ``` if (n->max_queues > 1) {    if (n->max_queues != qemu_get_be16(f)) {        error_report(\"virtio-net: different max_queues \");        return -1;    }     n->curr_queues = qemu_get_be16(f);    for (i = 1; i < n->curr_queues; i++) {        n->vqs[i].tx_waiting = qemu_get_be32(f);    } } ```  If the value of `curr_queues` (obtained from `qemu_get_be16(f)`) is greater than the size of `n->vqs`, it will result in an out-of-bounds write."
