OpenAFS Security Advisory 2013-004
Topic: vos -encrypt doesn't encrypt connection data
CVE-2013-4135
Issued:
Last Updated:
Affected: All OpenAFS clients
The -encrypt option to the 'vos' volume management command should cause
it to encrypt all data between client and server. However, in versions of
OpenAFS later than 1.6.0, it has no effect, and data is transmitted with
integrity protection only. In all versions of OpenAFS, vos -encrypt has
no effect when combined with the -localauth option.
IMPACT
======
Information which should be encrypted on the wire is only integrity
protected. An attacker may read RPC's initiated by the 'vos' command
which the administrator expected to remain private.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
All current releases of OpenAFS.
FIXES
=====
The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade to OpenAFS 1.6.5
or later.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
This issue was identified independently by Chaskiel M Grundman and Michael
Meffie. Patches were provided by Michael Meffie.

Package        : openafs
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4134 CVE-2013-4135

OpenAFS, the implementation of the distributed filesystem AFS, has been
updated to no longer use DES for the encryption of tickets. Additional
migration steps are needed to fully set the update into effect. For more
information please see the upstream advisory:
<http://www.openafs.org/security/OPENAFS-SA-2013-003.txt>

In addition the 'encrypt' option to the 'vos' tool was fixed.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12.1+dfsg-4+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.1-3+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
