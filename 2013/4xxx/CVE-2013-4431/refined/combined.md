### Bug Description

While working on issue [https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/+bug/1211758](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/%2Bbug/1211758) , I noticed that I could spoof the ID of the block that I wanted to edit, and by doing this I could edit other users' blocks. I used the "Burp Suite" tool to edit HTTP requests between my browser and my web server.

Steps:

1. Create a Mahara site with two users, A and B

2. User A creates a page with a text block that has ID 35

3. User B creates a page with a text block that has ID 105

4. User B edits their text block, ID 105

5. User B doctors the HTTP request so that the block ID in it is "35" instead of "105"

Result: User A's block 35 has all of its contents overwritten by the settings for block 105.

This attack could be done either by serially guessing IDs, or possibly by getting the ID by looking at a page that the user has view access to.

There are several different places in the code where it might be appropriate to check for Block ownership. BlockInstance->instance\_config\_store() is one possibility (though it could be overridden by child blocks).

We check View ownership in blocks.php, so it might make sense to check the block ownership there as well.

Or, in View->process\_changes(), before we set $this->blockinstance\_currently\_being\_configured, it might make sense to verify at that point that the block ID is a block that actually belongs to this view.

Similarly, you can also delete another user's block. And I suspect you can probably move one as well.

The most appropriate place to check for block ownership before deleting or moving, because of how they pass through View->process\_changes(), is probably in the functions View->moveblockinstance() and View->removeblockinstance().

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

Category:     Access Control
Severity:     High
Versions affected:  <1.5.12, <1.6.7, <1.7.3
Reported by:     Tom, Aaron Wells
Bug reports: [1211758](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/%2Bbug/1211758), [1233500](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/%2Bbug/1233500)
CVE references: [CVE-2013-4429](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2013-4429), [CVE-2013-4431](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2013-4431)

Access control vulnerabilities were reported which allow a logged-in attacker to access and manipulate other users' Artefacts and Blocks. These vulnerabilities have been fixed by the Mahara core developers.

As these vulnerabilities affect the privacy and data integrity of all Mahara users, we strongly recommend that all Mahara administrators upgrade to the latest version: 1.5.12, 1.6.7, or 1.7.3.

### Bug Description

While working on issue [https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/+bug/1211758](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/%2Bbug/1211758) , I noticed that I could spoof the ID of the block that I wanted to edit, and by doing this I could edit other users' blocks. I used the "Burp Suite" tool to edit HTTP requests between my browser and my web server.

Steps:

1. Create a Mahara site with two users, A and B

2. User A creates a page with a text block that has ID 35

3. User B creates a page with a text block that has ID 105

4. User B edits their text block, ID 105

5. User B doctors the HTTP request so that the block ID in it is "35" instead of "105"

Result: User A's block 35 has all of its contents overwritten by the settings for block 105.

This attack could be done either by serially guessing IDs, or possibly by getting the ID by looking at a page that the user has view access to.

There are several different places in the code where it might be appropriate to check for Block ownership. BlockInstance->instance\_config\_store() is one possibility (though it could be overridden by child blocks).

We check View ownership in blocks.php, so it might make sense to check the block ownership there as well.

Or, in View->process\_changes(), before we set $this->blockinstance\_currently\_being\_configured, it might make sense to verify at that point that the block ID is a block that actually belongs to this view.

Similarly, you can also delete another user's block. And I suspect you can probably move one as well.

The most appropriate place to check for block ownership before deleting or moving, because of how they pass through View->process\_changes(), is probably in the functions View->moveblockinstance() and View->removeblockinstance().
