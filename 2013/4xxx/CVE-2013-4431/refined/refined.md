Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4431:

*   **Root Cause:** The Mahara application does not properly check the ownership of blocks before allowing a user to edit them.

*   **Vulnerability:** Missing access control check.

*   **Attack Vector:** An authenticated user can modify HTTP requests (e.g., using a tool like Burp Suite) to change the block ID to that of another user's block.

*   **Impact:** By spoofing the block ID in the HTTP request, an attacker can overwrite the content and settings of another user's block. It is also suspected that an attacker could delete or move another user's blocks.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user. They also need the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests between their browser and the web server. Knowledge of block IDs could be obtained by guessing or by viewing pages to which the attacker has legitimate access.

*   **Affected Versions:** Mahara versions prior to 1.5.12, 1.6.7, and 1.7.3 are affected.
