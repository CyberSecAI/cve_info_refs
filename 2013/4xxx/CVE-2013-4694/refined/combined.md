by [Julien Ahrens](https://www.rcesecurity.com/author/mrtux/ "Posts by Julien Ahrens") | Monday, August 26, 2024 | [Bug Bounty](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/bug-bounty/), [CVE](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/cve/), [Exploit](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/exploit/)

A few days ago, Wordfence published a blog post about a PHP Object Injection vulnerability affecting the popular WordPress Plugin GiveWP in all versions <= 3.14.1. Since the blog post contains only information about (a part) of the POP chain used, I decided to take a look and build a fully functional Remote Code Execution exploit. This post describes how I approached the process, identifying the missing parts and building the entire POP chain.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# WinAmp v5.64 Fixes Several Code Execution Vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-4694, CVE-2013-4695)

by [Julien Ahrens](https://www.rcesecurity.com/author/mrtux/ "Posts by Julien Ahrens") | Monday, July 1, 2013 | [Advisory](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/advisory/) | [0 comments](https://www.rcesecurity.com/2013/07/winamp-v5-64-fixes-several-code-execution-vulnerabilities-cve-2013-4694-cve-2013-4695/#respond)

In early June I’ve reported several security vulnerabilities in Nullsoft’s flagship product WinAmp to the devs. I received an amazing fast answer from the WinAmp Team acknowledging all reported security vulnerabilities. Only 5 days later I’ve received a private build including fixes for nearly all reported issues. Except one, but after sending a second exploit – poc the last issue has been fixed quickly too. All in all – and among all my already discovered and reported security flaws, the coordination process with Nullsoft was the most transparent and security-addicted, I ever had to deal with.

By the way…I gave them a tough timeframe of 14 days for a reliable security update (Google-Style baby 😀 ), which is very minimalistic compared to the code basis! At first this was only meant to test if a big vendor is able to hold such a timeline. And they did! They even produced it much faster to my surprise. Other vendors should start to take a leaf out of their work! Great job guys :-)!

Complete [changelog](http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=364291).

Now the technical facts:

**The first advisory** [[CVE-2013-4694]](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Jul/4) consolidates and describes multiple buffer overflow conditions in different libraries of  WinAmp. But both mentioned bugs are completely different and one of them is a lot more heavily weighted than the other.

**The first bug** in CVE-2013-4694 is “remotely” exploitable – CVSSv2 score of 7,5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)! But how and where to be careful ?

> ```
> The application loads the directories in %PROGRAMFILES%\WinAmp\Skins on startup to determine the skins that have been installed and to list them in the application menu point "Skins" and in the Skins Browser. But the application does not properly validate the length of the directory name before passing it as argument to a lstrcpynW call in the library gen_jumpex.dll, which leads to a buffer overflow condition with possible code execution.
> ```

That’s all about it. A bad guy can send his victim a package containing an oversized directory name as the skin-name:

[![ia51-1](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ia51-1.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ia51-1.png)

Finally…the applications uses a lstrcpynW (yep, it’s unicode based) call to basically work with the skin directory name to identify it in the folder – structure of WinAmp. Read [this MS article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms647491%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) to find out why this function could lead to the dangerous behaviour:

[![ia51-2](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ia51-2.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ia51-2.png)

The application calls the vulnerable function @

```
.text:1001A5C0                 call    ds:lstrcpynW

```

which fills up the stack and finally RETs into the overwritten part of the stack:

```
.text:1001A5E9                 leave
.text:1001A5EA                 retn

```

…and that means control over EIP! But it’s a unicode based overflow with a limited scope of exploitation due to the nature of a unicode overflow…unless…someone finds a way to spray the heap or something like this 😉

**The second bug** isn’t as interesting as the first one, since it’s issued by entering an oversized string into one of the gui fields, which is a very unrealistic attack scenario…only interesting in sandbox-like environments or if the payload can be hidden using readable chars 😉

[![ia51-3](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ia51-3.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ia51-3.png)

**The second advisory** [[CVE-2013-4695](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Jul/5)] is a more complex vulnerability since it’s not a classic overflow scenario. It’s an invalid pointer dereference issue, which basically means that the attacker gets control over a specific part of a buffer which itself does not lead to any kind of code execution. But during the application flaw a pointer is called which dereferences a part of the controllable memory space…and THAT leads to real pwnage 😉

```
The application loads the contents of the %APPDATA%\WinAmp\links.xml on startup (the key lngId="default") and while browsing through the bookmarks in the Browser view of the GUI, but does not properly validate the length of the string loaded from the "" and "" keys before using them in a pointer call in the library gen_ff.dll, which leads to a invalid pointer dereference condition with possible code execution.
```

Also a complicated attack scenario, because the attacker has to copy an arbitrary links.xml somehow to the %appdata%\WinAmp directory. But after that, it’s quite easily to exploit. Some clicks here, some clicks there:

[![ia52-1](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ia52-1.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ia52-1.png)

…and the application crashes. Deciphered:

[![ia52-2](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ia52-2.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ia52-2.png)

The attacker has unicode control over ECX (00430043)! The content of ECX (more specific: the first 4 bytes “FF 30 51 E8”) are copied to EAX:

```
.text:073D0ED3                 mov     eax, [ecx]

```

and EAX (now contains “E8 51 30 FF” due to little endian) is  pointer-called afterwards:

```
.text:073D0EE1                 call    dword ptr [eax]

```

…leading to code execution. Another happy hacking-day :-)!

# [CVE-2013-4694] WinAmp v5.63 gen\_jumpex.dll and ml\_local.dll Multiple Buffer Overflows

---

*From*: Inshell Security <info () inshell net>

*Date*: Mon, 01 Jul 2013 19:53:12 +0200

Inshell Security Advisory
<http://www.inshell.net>

1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
-----------------------
Product:        WinAmp
Vendor URL:     www.winamp.com
Type:           Stack-based Buffer Overflow [CWE-121]
Date found:     2013-06-05
Date published: 2013-07-01
CVSSv2 Score:   Bug #1: 7,5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
                Bug #2: 3,7 (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
CVE:            CVE-2013-4694

2. CREDITS
----------
These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens
from Inshell Security.

3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
--------------------
WinAmp v5.63, older versions may be affected too.

4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION (BUG #1)
-------------------------------------
The application loads the directories in %PROGRAMFILES%\WinAmp\Skins on
startup to determine the skins that have been installed and to list them
in the application menu point "Skins" and in the Skins Browser. But the
application does not properly validate the length of the directory name
before passing it as argument to a lstrcpynW call in the library
gen_jumpex.dll, which leads to a buffer overflow condition with possible
code execution.

This flaw is also exploitable via the %APPDATA%\WinAmp\winamp.ini. The
application loads the contents on startup, but does not properly
validate the length of the string loaded from the "skin" key before
passing it as an argument to the same lstrcpynW call in the library
gen_jumpex.dll, which leads to the same buffer overflow condition.

An attacker either needs to trick the victim to download and apply an
arbitrary skin package in order to exploit the vulnerability or to copy
an arbitrary winamp.ini into the %APPDATA%\WinAmp directory. Successful
exploits can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. Failed exploits will
result in a denial-of-service condition.

4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION (BUG #2)
-------------------------------------
The application loads the string of the GUI "Search" field from the
"WinAmp Library" when entered by a user and after switching to another
menu point, but does not properly validate the length of the string
before passing it as an argument to a GetDlgItemTextW call in the
library ml_local.dll, which leads to a buffer overflow condition with
possible code execution.

An attacker needs local access to the client in order to exploit the
vulnerability. Successful exploits can allow attackers to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
Failed exploits will result in a denial-of-service condition.

A few days ago, Wordfence published a blog post about a PHP Object Injection vulnerability affecting the popular WordPress Plugin GiveWP in all versions <= 3.14.1. Since the blog post contains only information about (a part) of the POP chain used, I decided to take a look and build a fully functional Remote Code Execution exploit. This post describes how I approached the process, identifying the missing parts and building the entire POP chain.

Inshell Security Advisory
http://www.inshell.net

1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
-----------------------
Product:        WinAmp
Vendor URL:     www.winamp.com
Type:           Stack-based Buffer Overflow [CWE-121]
Date found:     2013-06-05
Date published: 2013-07-01
CVSSv2 Score:   Bug #1: 7,5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
    Bug #2: 3,7 (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
CVE:            CVE-2013-4694

2. CREDITS
----------
These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens
from Inshell Security.

3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
--------------------
WinAmp v5.63, older versions may be affected too.

4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION (BUG #1)
-------------------------------------
The application loads the directories in %PROGRAMFILES%\WinAmp\Skins on
startup to determine the skins that have been installed and to list them
in the application menu point "Skins" and in the Skins Browser. But the
application does not properly validate the length of the directory name
before passing it as argument to a lstrcpynW call in the library
gen_jumpex.dll, which leads to a buffer overflow condition with possible
code execution.

This flaw is also exploitable via the %APPDATA%\WinAmp\winamp.ini. The
application loads the contents on startup, but does not properly
validate the length of the string loaded from the "skin" key before
passing it as an argument to the same lstrcpynW call in the library
gen_jumpex.dll, which leads to the same buffer overflow condition.

An attacker either needs to trick the victim to download and apply an
arbitrary skin package in order to exploit the vulnerability or to copy
an arbitrary winamp.ini into the %APPDATA%\WinAmp directory. Successful
exploits can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. Failed exploits will
result in a denial-of-service condition.

4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION (BUG #2)
-------------------------------------
The application loads the string of the GUI "Search" field from the
"WinAmp Library" when entered by a user and after switching to another
menu point, but does not properly validate the length of the string
before passing it as an argument to a GetDlgItemTextW call in the
library ml_local.dll, which leads to a buffer overflow condition with
possible code execution.

An attacker needs local access to the client in order to exploit the
vulnerability. Successful exploits can allow attackers to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
Failed exploits will result in a denial-of-service condition.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

While working on a recent customer engagement, I discovered two fascinating and somewhat weird bugs in SecurePoint’s UTM firewall solution. The first one, aka CVE-2023-22620, is rated critical for an attacker to bypass the entire authentication and gain access...

This is the story of an unauthenticated RCE affecting one of Dropbox’s in scope vendors during last year’s H1-3120 event. It’s one of my more recon-intensive, yet simple, vulnerabilities, and it (probably) helped me to become MVH by the end of the...
