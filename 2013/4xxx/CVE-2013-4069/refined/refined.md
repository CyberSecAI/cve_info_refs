Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4069:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a misconfigured XML parser within the Eclipse Business Intelligence Reporting Tool ViewerServlet. This misconfiguration allows the use of the `<DOCTYPE>` directive, enabling the definition and referencing of external XML entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **External XML Entity (XXE) Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include external XML entities. This arises because the XML parser doesn't properly restrict or sanitize external entity references.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially retrieve files from the server.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can use the server to reach internal services behind the firewall. This is done by forcing the server to make requests to other resources on the internal network, bypassing the firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Specific Component:** The vulnerability is located within the Eclipse Business Intelligence Reporting Tool ViewerServlet.
- **Malicious XML File:** The attacker instructs the vulnerable servlet to parse a rogue XML file residing on an accessible network location (e.g., a Windows share on the same LAN).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is running.
- **Network Visibility:** The attacker needs to have the ability to host a malicious XML file on a network location reachable by the vulnerable server, typically on the same local network.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing to authenticate to the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided document indicates that this vulnerability affects all deployments of IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services.
- The vulnerability is linked to APAR PM95817.
- Patches are provided in SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services 5.0 FP3 and 4.2.1.3 IF003
