The provided content describes a security research project on SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) routers, highlighting various vulnerabilities discovered. While the document lists several CVEs discovered, it does not specifically describe CVE-2013-4658. However, it provides detailed information on the general types of vulnerabilities found.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root causes are varied and include insecure coding practices, lack of input validation, flawed authentication mechanisms, and insecure default configurations. Specific root causes for individual vulnerabilities are not provided.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Remote and local attacker access to router configuration settings
*   Authentication bypass
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Denial of Service (DoS)
*   Unvalidated URL Redirects
*   Information Disclosure
*   Unauthenticated Hardware Linking
*   SMB Symlink Traversal
*   Failure to Validate HTTP Authorization Headers
*   FTP Directory Traversal
*  Unencrypted password storage
*   Directory traversal
*   Arbitrary command injection
*  UPnP vulnerabilities including buffer overflows

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Full control of router configuration
*   Interception and modification of network traffic
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks
*   Sniffing and rerouting of non-SSL protected traffic
*   DNS poisoning
*   Denial of Service attacks
*   Impersonating servers
*   Compromise of local area hosts
*   Botnet deployment
*   Router "bricking"

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote attacks via WAN
*   Local attacks via LAN or WLAN
*   Trivial attacks requiring no user interaction
*   Unauthenticated attacks requiring some user interaction, like clicking a link
*   Authenticated attacks requiring credentials or active session
*   Client-side attacks using HTML/JavaScript

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Local network (LAN/WLAN) access
*   Remote access (WAN)
*   Some attacks require no active management session or credentials
*   Other attacks require credentials (or default credentials), or active user session.
*   Some attacks can be launched through browser-based exploits (HTML/Javascript).

The document indicates that all 13 routers tested were vulnerable to local attacks, and 11 of 13 were vulnerable to remote attacks.
