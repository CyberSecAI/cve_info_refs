  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2013-4280",
    "description": "Insecure temporary file vulnerability in RedHat vsdm 4.9.6.",
    "affected_component": "vdsm",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of insecure temporary file creation in the VDSM (Virtual Desktop and Server Manager) software. Specifically, the software uses the /tmp directory for various temporary files, potentially leading to symlink attacks and other issues.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Potential for symlink attacks due to usage of /tmp directory",
      "Use of hardcoded /tmp paths for log files and other temporary data."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit these insecure temporary file practices by performing symlink attacks. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access, information disclosure, or other malicious activity if an attacker can manipulate file paths.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access to the system where VDSM is running. An attacker could potentially exploit the insecure use of the `/tmp` directory by creating malicious symlinks or files, potentially overwriting or corrupting sensitive data.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system and ability to create files and symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.",
    "resolution": "The issue was addressed by changes in the code to prevent usage of /tmp, including avoiding creating temporary files in `/tmp` as described in Red Hat Bugzilla entry 987768.  However, some uses of /tmp were deemed non-exploitable or deprecated and marked as WONTFIX."
