Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-4956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Puppet Module Tool, used for installing modules, was not setting correct permissions on installed modules. Instead, it was transferring permissions from the user who originally created the module. This allowed a local user with write access to the Puppet module directory to potentially modify the modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Permissions:** The core issue lies in how the Puppet Module Tool handled permissions when installing modules, resulting in the wrong permissions being applied.
- **Local Privilege Escalation:**  A local user could exploit the permission weakness to modify module files and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By modifying the modules, a malicious local user could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Puppet master. This can lead to full system compromise.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Local users could potentially gain the privileges of the puppet master, escalating their privileges within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack requires a malicious local user to have write access to the Puppet module directory on the Puppet master server.
- **Module Modification:** The attacker must have write access to the module directory. They can then modify existing modules to insert malicious code, to be run with the Puppet master's privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the Puppet master server.
- **Write Access:** The attacker must have write permissions to the directory where Puppet modules are installed.
