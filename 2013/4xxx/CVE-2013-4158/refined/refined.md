Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4158:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content consistently references CVE-2013-4158 and describes an XSS vulnerability in Smokeping related to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0790. Therefore, the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an incomplete fix for a previous XSS vulnerability (CVE-2012-0790). The initial fix used a blacklist that was not comprehensive enough, allowing attackers to bypass the filtering and inject malicious code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incomplete Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness was the use of an insufficient blacklist to sanitize user input. Specifically, the initial blacklist `/[<>&%]/` failed to block characters like single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), and semicolons (`;`), which are critical for exploiting XSS vulnerabilities in HTML attributes.
- **Blacklisting Approach:** Relying on a blacklist instead of a whitelist for input sanitization is generally considered less secure and prone to bypasses.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Smokeping web interface.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the web interface.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through the Smokeping web interface.
- **Malicious Input:** Attackers can inject malicious code through user-controlled inputs that are not properly sanitized. This most likely happens through the "mode" parameter, as mentioned in the provided text.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Smokeping web interface.
- **Ability to Inject Malicious Input:** The attacker needs the ability to inject specifically crafted payloads containing malicious characters that are not blocked by the incomplete filter. This would typically involve injecting input into a parameter that gets displayed on the webpage.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE description):**

*   **Specific Blacklist:** The content reveals the specific blacklists used in vulnerable ( `/[<>&%]/` ) and fixed versions ( `/[<>%&'";]/` ), highlighting the characters that were missing from the initial attempt to fix CVE-2012-0790.
*   **Version Affected:**  Smokeping versions 2.6.7 and 2.6.8 are vulnerable, while 2.6.9 includes the fix.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involved expanding the blacklist to include characters like single quotes, double quotes, and semicolons, converting these chars to underscores instead of dots.
*   **Gentoo's handling:** Gentoo does not issue GLSA (Gentoo Linux Security Advisory) for XSS issues in general.
*   **Red Hatâ€™s Handling**: Red Hat considers this a community support issue, and does not directly affect their commercially supported products.
*   **Debian's Handling:** The Debian package already implemented a more complete fix than upstream versions of Smokeping at the time of the vulnerability.
*   **Ubuntu's Handling:** Ubuntu considers the issue a medium severity, and marked versions as vulnerable and/or ignored EOL depending on the Ubuntu release.
*   **SUSE's Handling:** SUSE states this issue does not affect their products.

In summary, CVE-2013-4158 is due to an incomplete fix for a prior XSS issue in Smokeping, exposing a vulnerability exploitable through maliciously crafted user input. The information provided contains sufficient detail to understand the nature of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, and necessary steps for remediation.
