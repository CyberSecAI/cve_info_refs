- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web management application fails to restrict URL access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated access to the `/filesystem/startup-config` URL which allows disclosure of the startup configuration file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote, unauthenticated attackers can download the device's startup configuration file, which contains administrator credentials in encrypted form.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a simple HTTP GET request to `http://Target-IP/filesystem/startup-config`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target device (network access). No authentication is needed.
