Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure in the TYPO3 core's file upload component and File Abstraction Layer to properly check for and deny specific file extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Remote Code Execution:** The lack of proper file extension filtering allows authenticated backend users to upload files with executable code (e.g., PHP files).
-   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system does not adequately validate file uploads to prevent the introduction of malicious file types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution on the server.
-   Attackers can execute arbitrary code within the webserver's context, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **File Upload:** An attacker leverages the backend file upload functionality.
-   **Authentication Required:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated backend user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to have a valid backend user account.
-   The attacker needs permissions to upload files through the TYPO3 backend interface.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability was discovered by Sebastian Nerz and reported to the TYPO3 security team.
-   The vulnerability affects all TYPO3 versions from 6.0.0 up to the development branch of 6.2.
-   Patches are available in TYPO3 versions 6.0.8 and 6.1.3.
-   The provided CVSS v2.0 vector is `AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:O/RC:C`, indicating a critical severity.
