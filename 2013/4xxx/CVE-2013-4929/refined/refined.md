Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-4929:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The DIS (Distributed Interactive Simulation) dissector in Wireshark could enter a large loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the DIS dissector that can cause an infinite or very large loop when processing certain malformed packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could lead to excessive CPU resource consumption, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The application might become unresponsive, or the system it runs on might slow down significantly.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by:
  - Injecting a malformed DIS packet onto the network.
  - Convincing a user to open a malicious packet capture file containing a malformed DIS packet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by having the ability to inject crafted network packets or by providing a malicious capture file to a Wireshark user. The attacker could be remote, or local depending on the scenario. The attacker needs to craft a specific malformed packet to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark 1.10.0
- Wireshark 1.8.0 to 1.8.8

**Fixed Versions:**
- Wireshark 1.10.1
- Wireshark 1.8.9
