Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `UpdateCertificatesServlet` of HP PCM Plus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The `UpdateCertificatesServlet` does not properly sanitize the `fileName` argument. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to upload a malicious file, specifically a `.jsp` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **System Level Privileges:** The code execution occurs under the context of the SYSTEM user, granting the attacker full control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required for exploiting this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable HP PCM Plus server.
- **No Specific Privileges:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges to exploit this flaw.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote code execution via a file upload vulnerability due to improper sanitization of the `fileName` parameter in the `UpdateCertificatesServlet`. Successful exploitation grants an attacker SYSTEM level privileges on the target system.
