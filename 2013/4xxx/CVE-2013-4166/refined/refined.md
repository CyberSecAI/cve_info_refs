Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4166:

**Summary:** The vulnerability is due to how the Evolution email client handles GPG key selection for email encryption.  Specifically, Evolution was using a flawed method to identify the recipient's public key leading to emails encrypted for the wrong intended user.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Evolution mail client was using the `gpg --encrypt -r address` command for selecting the GPG key. This command matches any User ID containing "address," including names, comments, or email addresses, not just the recipient's email address.
*   GPG returns the first match, meaning that if a different User ID (e.g., a name) matches before the intended email address, the email would be encrypted using that incorrect key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect GPG Key Selection:** The primary vulnerability lies in Evolution's incorrect method of selecting GPG keys, leading to the possibility of encrypting emails with the wrong public key.
*   **Lack of User Confirmation:** Evolution did not prompt the user to confirm the selected public key, making the issue silent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  The main impact is the potential compromise of confidentiality. Emails could be encrypted for unintended recipients, exposing sensitive information.
*   **Silent Misdirection:**  The incorrect key selection occurs silently, meaning users are not alerted that an email will be encrypted with the wrong public key.
*   **Real-World Risk:** The issue was experienced during the forwarding of embargoed security issues, demonstrating a real risk of accidental exposure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the normal usage of Evolution's encryption functionality. The vulnerability is exploited simply by attempting to encrypt an email to a recipient whose email address has a potential key collision.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   No specific attacker capabilities are required. The vulnerability arises from the way Evolution is designed.
*   The "attacker" is essentially the user themselves, unknowingly encrypting an email with the wrong public key.
*   The "attacker" needs overlapping email addresses in the recipient list.
*   The "attacker" needs to have multiple keys in their keyring with overlapping email addresses

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present since at least the 1.5 release of Evolution in 2004.
*   A fix was implemented to use the documented GPG format of enclosing email addresses with angle brackets (<email@address.com>) to ensure exact email address matching when encrypting.
*   The issue was fixed in Evolution Data Server versions 3.9.5 and 3.8.4.
*   A more robust fix for explicit key selection should be implemented.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 was not patched, due to it entering Production 3 phase of the support and maintenance life cycle.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was patched in RHSA-2013:1540.
*   The issue is rated as "Low" severity.

The information provided is more detailed than the official CVE description by providing:

*   The exact command being used to select gpg keys.
*   The workaround being implemented (using <> around emails)
*   The versions where the issue was fixed.
*   The reasoning for RedHat not patching older versions.
