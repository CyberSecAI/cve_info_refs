Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4399:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- When a connection to `libvirtd` is closed, any registered event handlers must be removed.
- If Access Control Lists (ACLs) are active, the removal of event handlers failed because no identity was set during the removal process.
- Consequently, the operation was denied, and the event handlers remained connected to the freed client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Resource Handling:** Failure to properly remove event handlers upon client disconnection.
- **Missing Identity Context:**  The removal process lacks the necessary identity context when ACLs are enabled, leading to authorization failures.
- **Use-after-free vulnerability**: Event handlers continued to operate after the client that registered them was freed

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unprivileged user can cause a crash of the `libvirtd` daemon by registering event handlers when ACLs are active. This crash leads to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** A local user with the ability to connect to the libvirtd daemon can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unprivileged Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to interact with the `libvirtd` daemon.
- **ACLs Enabled:** The vulnerability is triggered when Access Control Lists are active.
- **Event Registration Ability:** The attacker needs the ability to register event handlers with the libvirt daemon.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in libvirt versions 1.1.0, 1.1.1, and 1.1.2.
- It was fixed in version 1.1.3 and later
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `ed3bac713c3cfc055ef551cbfe92a061084382c3` and fixed by commit `8294aa0c1750dcb49d6345cd9bd97bf421580d8b` on the master branch and similar commits on v1.1.0-maint, v1.1.1-maint and v1.1.2-maint branches.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 201412-04 includes CVE-2013-4399, describing it as a vulnerability where a local attacker may be able to cause a Denial of Service.
