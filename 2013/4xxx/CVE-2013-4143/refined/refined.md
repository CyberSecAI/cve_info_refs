Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4143:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from potential NULL pointer dereferences within xlockmore when authenticating via `glibc 2.17+ crypt()` and OSF/1 C2 security's `dispcrypt()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: Under specific conditions, the authentication process can result in NULL pointers being dereferenced, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Bypass of screen lock: A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause xlockmore to crash, effectively bypassing the screen lock and granting unauthorized access to the system.
- Denial of Service: The crash can also be considered a denial-of-service, as the intended screen lock functionality is interrupted.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting a flaw in the authentication mechanism within xlockmore when specific crypt implementations (`glibc 2.17+ crypt()` and OSF/1 C2 security's `dispcrypt()`) are utilized.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position where they can attempt to authenticate against a locked xlockmore screen.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the specific conditions that trigger the NULL pointer dereference. This may involve manipulating the password or the system environment.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in xlockmore version 5.43.
- The issue is related to how xlockmore handles authentication with certain password hashing mechanisms, and the fact that it does not properly check for NULL pointers during this process.
- The original request for a CVE was made with the information that `xlockmore 5.43` fixed this security flaw.
- The provided code commit link from `sourceforge.net` confirms the fix was made in xlockmore.
