Thanks, Please use CVE-2013-4143 for this issue.

Huh? So just the release tarballs? That's annoying :P As for the
requirements it depends, different CVE requesters have different
requirements depending on how well they do things. E.g. Some do CVE
very well, but to make absolutely sure SPLIT/MERGE is done right I
request some details, others like Drupal have security advisories that
are sufficiently detailed that i can assign based on them alone, so
until a CVE requester proves that they know what they are doing,
reliably, I'm going to need details to make sure the CVE assignment is
done correctly. Part of the issue is scale, I do 1000+ CVE assignments
a year, so if they start taking more then 5-10 minutes I won't have
time to do anything else (like my day job, or sleep).

Welcome to security where just contacting some of them can be an epic
task.

Subject: CVE Request - xlockmore 5.43 fixes a security flaw

Hello Kurt, vendors, et al.

xlockmore 5.43 released 2 days ago with a fix for a security
flaw related to potential NULL pointer dereferences when
authenticating via glibc 2.17+ crypt() and OSF/1 C2 security's
dispcrypt().

Under certain conditions the NULL pointers can trigger a crash
in xlockmore effectively bypassing the screen lock.
