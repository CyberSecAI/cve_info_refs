Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A backdoor was intentionally introduced into the OpenX Ad Server software. This malicious code was present in the `flowplayer-3.1.1.min.js` file, which was part of the `openXVideoAds.zip` plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Backdoor:** The primary weakness is the presence of a backdoor, allowing unauthorized remote code execution.
- **Obfuscated Code:** The malicious code was obfuscated, likely using `rot13` and reversing, to make it harder to detect.
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The backdoor was included within a zip file, suggesting the software had a weakness that allowed for the upload and execution of arbitrary files, or that this backdoor was introduced via a supply-chain attack.
- **Insecure HTTP Request Handling:** The software processed POST requests that included the malicious code, demonstrating a lack of proper input sanitization/validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code on the affected server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Remote code execution can lead to full control of the compromised server, allowing attackers to steal data, install malware, or pivot to other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to a specific URL (`/openx/www/delivery/fc.php`).
- **Payload Injection:** The malicious code is sent as the `vastPlayer` POST parameter in the request.
- **Rot13 and Reverse Obfuscation:** The PHP payload is encoded using `rot13` and reversed before being sent to bypass simple detection mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable OpenX Ad Server.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The provided exploit code suggests that no authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** Attacker must know that the target system is running a vulnerable version of OpenX.

**Additional Notes**
- The backdoor was present in OpenX 2.8.10 and potentially earlier versions from at least November 2012 to August 2013.
- The `Metasploit` module provides a ready-to-use exploit for this vulnerability.
