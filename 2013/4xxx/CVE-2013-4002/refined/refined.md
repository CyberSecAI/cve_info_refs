Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2013-4002:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability present in the Apache Xerces-J XML parser which is used by various Java-based products, including OpenJDK. This vulnerability is triggered when parsing malformed XML data. Specifically, the parser can be made to consume excessive CPU resources while parsing an XML document containing a specially crafted declaration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper XML parsing allows for DoS attacks.
- Vulnerable parser (Xerces-J XML parser) within OpenJDK and IBM JRE.
- Inability to properly handle malformed XML data causing excessive CPU consumption.
- The `requireSignedEncryptedDataElements` property in Apache WSS4J could be bypassed with an incomplete fix.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to excessive CPU and/or memory consumption
- System instability
- Potential for remote, unauthenticated attacks in some instances

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, by sending a crafted XML document to a vulnerable application (most common).
- Local exploitation is mentioned in the HP-UX bulletin, suggesting the possibility of privilege escalation or data disclosure through local means.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send malformed XML data to a vulnerable application
- In some cases, no authentication is needed for the attack (remote, unauthenticated). However, some attacks may require a malicious or authenticated web application.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Xerces-J parses XML declarations, specifically a long pseudo-attribute name
- Multiple products are affected including: IBM FileNet Content Manager, IBM Content Foundation, Oracle Java SE, HP-UX, Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization, Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, and others
- Patches and upgrades are provided by several vendors for affected software, including IBM and Red Hat.
- Red Hat details specific affected products (including the different versions of RHEL) and the specific errata that fixes them.
- OpenJDK details the related fixes (in IcedTea, OpenJDK, etc.)
- IBM provides updates to IBM JRE to resolve the vulnerability
- HP notes that JDK and JRE versions v6.0.20 and earlier, v7.0.07 and earlier are vulnerable on HP-UX.
- The vulnerability is also present in other libraries that use Xerces-J XML parser.
