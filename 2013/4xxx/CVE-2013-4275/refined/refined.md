Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Zen theme for Drupal fails to properly sanitize the breadcrumb separator when displaying it. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw due to the lack of sanitization of user-provided input in the breadcrumb separator field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page. This can lead to various attacks, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Stealing sensitive information
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Breadcrumb Separator Field:** The attacker injects the malicious script through the "Breadcrumb separator" configuration field in the Zen theme settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs the "administer themes" permission in Drupal, which is typically given to administrators or users with higher access. In Drupal 6, it is "administer site configuration" permission or write access to the database.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `zen_breadcrumb` function within the `zen/zen/template.php` file.
*   The vulnerability was found in Zen versions 7.x-3.x before 7.x-3.2 and 7.x-5.x before 7.x-5.4, as well as in version 6.x-1.1.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the breadcrumb separator is properly escaped or sanitized before being rendered.
*   The initial report indicated a limit of 10 characters for the breadcrumb configuration form.

**Patch:**

The provided patch shows that the fix involved removing `check_plain` from the breadcrumb separator variable assignment:
```
-     $breadcrumb_separator = check_plain(theme_get_setting('zen_breadcrumb_separator'));
+     $breadcrumb_separator = theme_get_setting('zen_breadcrumb_separator');
```

This indicates that the vulnerability was caused by double encoding the breadcrumb separator, which was being passed through `check_plain` after theme_get_setting and then displayed, breaking the escaping. The fix was to just use the raw value from `theme_get_setting`.
