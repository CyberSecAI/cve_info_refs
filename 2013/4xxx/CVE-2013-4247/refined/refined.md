Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2013-4247 vulnerability:

- **Vulnerability:** Off-by-one buffer overflow in the CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation in the Linux kernel.
- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an error in the `build_unc_path_to_root` function within the CIFS module. Specifically, a pointer arithmetic error occurs when constructing the UNC path to the root directory of a CIFS share.  The code incorrectly accounts for an incremented "pos" pointer, leading to a one-byte buffer overrun.
- **Affected Software:** Linux kernel with CONFIG_CIFS and CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL enabled.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker could exploit this flaw by mounting a Distributed File System (DFS) share where the server provides DFS referral names of a specific length that triggers the overflow.  The attacker needs the ability to mount a file system.
- **Impact:** A successful exploit can cause memory corruption, leading to an unresponsive kernel, a system crash, and ultimately a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Affected Versions:** v3.8+
- **Fix:** The provided patch corrects the pointer arithmetic in the `build_unc_path_to_root` function to properly handle the "pos" pointer, preventing the buffer overflow.

The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that the vulnerability was marked as "WONTFIX" for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2, suggesting that those older versions were not affected.
