cifs: fix off-by-one bug in build\_unc\_path\_to\_rootcommit 839db3d10a (cifs: fix up handling of prefixpath= option) changed
the code such that the vol->prepath no longer contained a leading
delimiter and then fixed up the places that accessed that field to
account for that change.
One spot in build\_unc\_path\_to\_root was missed however. When doing the
pointer addition on pos, that patch failed to account for the fact that
we had already incremented "pos" by one when adding the length of the
prepath. This caused a buffer overrun by one byte.
This patch fixes the problem by correcting the handling of "pos".

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=998401#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-08-19 08:34:33 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the Common Internet File System (CONFIG_CIFS) support along with a feature to access Distributed File Systems (CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL), is vulnerable to a memory corruption flaw caused by writing one byte past an allocated memory area. It occurs while mounting a DFS share wherein the server provides DFS referral names of certain length. The memory corruption leads to an unresponsive kernel and subsequent crash resulting in Denial of Service.  An user/program able to mount a file system could use this flaw to crash the kernel resulting in DoS.  Upstream fix: -------------  -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/1fc29bacedeabb278080e31bb9c1ecb49f143c3b>  Reference: ----------  -> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/08/14/8>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=998401#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2013-08-19 08:37:48 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of the kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.   ``` |  |

s390: Add pgste to ptep\_modify\_prot\_start()
Commit 52f36be0f4e2 's390/pgtable: Fix check for pgste/storage key
handling', which was commit b56433cb782d upstream, added a use of
pgste to ptep\_modify\_prot\_start(), but this variable does not exist.
In mainline, pgste was added by commit d3383632d4e8 's390/mm: add pte
invalidation notifier for kvm' and initialised to the return value of
pgste\_get\_lock(ptep). Initialise it similarly here.
Compile-tested only.

timekeeping: Correct run-time detection of persistent\_clock.
commit 0d6bd9953f739dad96d9a0de65383e479ab4e10d upstream.
Since commit 31ade30692dc9680bfc95700d794818fa3f754ac, timekeeping\_init()
checks for presence of persistent clock by attempting to read a non-zero
time value. This is an issue on platforms where persistent\_clock (instead
is implemented as a free-running counter (instead of an RTC) starting
from zero on each boot and running during suspend. Examples are some ARM
platforms (e.g. PandaBoard).
An attempt to read such a clock during timekeeping\_init() may return zero
value and falsely declare persistent clock as missing. Additionally, in
the above case suspend times may be accounted twice (once from
timekeeping\_resume() and once from rtc\_resume()), resulting in a gradual
drift of system time.
This patch does a run-time correction of the issue by doing the same check
during timekeeping\_suspend().
A better long-term solution would have to return error when trying to read
non-existing clock and zero when trying to read an uninitialized clock, but
that would require changing all persistent\_clock implementations.
This patch addresses the immediate breakage, for now.

xen/smp: Fixup NOHZ per cpu data when onlining an offline CPU.
commit 466318a87f28cb3ba0d08a3b7ef1a37ae73d5aa7 upstream.
The xen\_play\_dead is an undead function. When the vCPU is told to
offline it ends up calling xen\_play\_dead wherin it calls the
VCPUOP\_down hypercall which offlines the vCPU. However, when the
vCPU is onlined back, it resumes execution right after
VCPUOP\_down hypercall.
That was OK (albeit the API for play\_dead assumes that the CPU
stays dead and never returns) but with commit 4b0c0f294
(tick: Cleanup NOHZ per cpu data on cpu down) that is no longer safe
as said commit resets the ts->inidle which at the start of the
cpu\_idle loop was set.
The net effect is that we get this warn:
Broke affinity for irq 16

that is what this patch does and fixes the issue.

Fix lockup related to stop\_machine being stuck in \_\_do\_softirq.
commit 34376a50fb1fa095b9d0636fa41ed2e73125f214 upstream.
The stop machine logic can lock up if all but one of the migration
threads make it through the disable-irq step and the one remaining
thread gets stuck in \_\_do\_softirq. The reason \_\_do\_softirq can hang is
that it has a bail-out based on jiffies timeout, but in the lockup case,
jiffies itself is not incremented.
To work around this, re-add the max\_restart counter in \_\_do\_irq and stop
processing irqs after 10 restarts.
Thanks to Tejun Heo and Rusty Russell and others for helping me track
this down.
This was introduced in 3.9 by commit c10d73671ad3 ("softirq: reduce
latencies").
It may be worth looking into ath9k to see if it has issues with its irq
handler at a later date.
The hang stack traces look something like this:

drm/i915: force full modeset if the connector is in DPMS OFF mode
commit e3de42b68478a8c95dd27520e9adead2af9477a5 upstream.
Currently the driver's assumed behavior for a modeset with an attached
FB is that the corresponding connector will be switched to DPMS ON mode
if it happened to be in DPMS OFF (or another power save mode). This
wasn't enforced though if only the FB changed, everything else (format,
connector etc.) remaining the same. In this case we only set the new FB
base and left the connector in the old power save mode.
Fix this by forcing a full modeset whenever there is an attached FB and
any affected connector is in a power save mode.
V\_2: Run the test for encoders in power save mode outside the the
test for fb change: user space may have just disabled the encoders
but left everything else in place. Make sure the connector list is
not empty before running this test.

radeon: use max\_bus\_speed to activate gen2 speeds
commit 7e0e41963740525af702bb23edede8ae9afc4ac0 upstream.
radeon currently uses a drm function to get the speed capabilities for
the bus, drm\_pcie\_get\_speed\_cap\_mask. However, this is a non-standard
method of performing this detection and this patch changes it to use
the max\_bus\_speed attribute.

powerpc/pseries: Perform proper max\_bus\_speed detection
commit d82fb31abc46620b7c22758c75707069f2763646 upstream.
On pseries machines the detection for max\_bus\_speed should be done
through an OpenFirmware property. This patch adds a function to perform
this detection and a hook to perform dynamic adding of the function only
for pseries. This is done by overwriting the weak
pcibios\_root\_bridge\_prepare function which is called by
pci\_create\_root\_bus().

powerpc/pseries: Make 32-bit MSI quirk work on systems lacking firmware support
commit f1dd153121dcb872ae6cba8d52bec97519eb7d97 upstream.
Recent commit e61133dda480062d221f09e4fc18f66763f8ecd0 added support
for a new firmware feature to force an adapter to use 32 bit MSIs.
However, this firmware is not available for all systems. The hack below
allows devices needing 32 bit MSIs to work on these systems as well.
It is careful to only enable this on Gen2 slots, which should limit
this to configurations where this hack is needed and tested to work.

Commit 9f29ab11ddbf ("ACPI / scan: do not match drivers against objects

"It panics with the message:
Kernel panic - not syncing: Unable to find SBA IOMMU: Try a generic or DIG kernel
[...] my problem comes from arch/ia64/hp/common/sba\_iommu.c
where the code in sba\_init() says:
acpi\_bus\_register\_driver(&acpi\_sba\_ioc\_driver);
if (!ioc\_list) {
but because of this change we never managed to call ioc\_init()
so ioc\_list doesn't get set up, and we die."

to address later.

drm/i915: clear up wedged transitions
X can again get -EIO when it does not expect it. And even worse score
a SIGBUS when accessing gtt mmaps. The established ABI is that we
\_only\_ return an -EIO from execbuf - all other ioctls should just
work. And since the reset code moves all bos out of gpu domains and
clears out all the last\_seqno/ring tracking there really shouldn't be
any reason for non-execbuf code to ever touch the hw and see an -EIO.
After some extensive discussions we've noticed that these spurios -EIO
are caused by i915\_gem\_wait\_for\_error:
http://www.mail-archive.com/intel-gfx@lists.freedesktop.org/msg20540.html
That is easy to fix by returning 0 instead of -EIO, since grabbing the
dev->struct\_mutex does not yet mean that we actually want to touch the
hw. And so there is no reason at all to fail with -EIO.
But that's not the entire since, since often (at least it's easily
googleable) dmesg indicates that the reset fails and we declare the
gpu wedged. Then, quite a bit later X wakes up with the "Timed out
waiting for the gpu reset to complete" DRM\_ERROR message in
wait\_for\_errror and brings down the desktop with an -EIO/SIGBUS.
So clearly we're missing a wakeup somewhere, since the gpu reset just
doesn't take 10 seconds to complete. And indeed we're do handle the
terminally wedged state wrong.
Fix this all up.

drm: fix a use-after-free when GPU acceleration disabled
commit b7ea85a4fed37835eec78a7be3039c8dc22b8178 upstream.
When GPU acceleration is disabled, drm\_vblank\_cleanup() will free the
vblank-related data, such as vblank\_refcount, vblank\_inmodeset, etc.
But we found that drm\_vblank\_post\_modeset() may be called after the
cleanup, which use vblank\_refcount and vblank\_inmodeset. And this will
cause a kernel panic.
Fix this by return immediately if dev->num\_crtcs is zero. This is the
same thing that drm\_vblank\_pre\_modeset() does.

One spot in build\_unc\_path\_to\_root was missed however. When doing the
pointer addition on pos, that patch failed to account for the fact that
we had already incremented "pos" by one when adding the length of the
prepath. This caused a buffer overrun by one byte.

radeon: Fix system hang issue when using KMS with older cards
commit e49f3959a96dc279860af7e86e6dbcfda50580a5 upstream.
The current radeon driver initialization routines, when using KMS, are written
so that the IRQ installation routine is called before initializing the WB buffer
and the CP rings. With some ASICs, though, the IRQ routine tries to access the
GFX\_INDEX ring causing a call to RREG32 with the value of -1 in
radeon\_fence\_read. This, in turn causes the system to completely hang with some
cards, requiring a hard reset.
A call stack that can cause such a hang looks like this (using rv515 ASIC for the
example here):
\* rv515\_init (rv515.c)
\* radeon\_irq\_kms\_init (radeon\_irq\_kms.c)
\* drm\_irq\_install (drm\_irq.c)
\* radeon\_driver\_irq\_preinstall\_kms (radeon\_irq\_kms.c)
\* rs600\_irq\_process (rs600.c)
\* radeon\_fence\_process - due to SW interrupt (radeon\_fence.c)
\* radeon\_fence\_read (radeon\_fence.c)
\* hang due to RREG32(-1)
The patch moves the IRQ installation to the card startup routine, after the ring
has been initialized, but before the IRQ has been set. This fixes the issue, but
requires a check to see if the IRQ is already installed, as is the case in the
system resume codepath.
I have tested the patch on three machines using the rv515, the rv770 and the
evergreen ASIC. They worked without issues.
This seems to be a known issue and has been reported on several bug tracking
sites by various distributions (see links below). Most of reports recommend
booting the system with KMS disabled and then enabling KMS by reloading the
radeon module. For some reason, this was indeed a usable workaround, however,
UMS is now deprecated and disabled by default.

dmaengine: ste\_dma40: fix pm runtime ref counting
commit 9ecb41bd8cf002fd8f3e063db4df81647ddd623c upstream.
The pm runtime reference counting of the driver is broken for the case
when there is more than one transfer queued, leading to the device being
runtime suspend while active. Fix it.

powerpc/perf: Fix deadlock caused by calling printk() in PMU exception
commit 6772faa1ba22eba18d087c2459030a683b65be57 upstream.
In commit bc09c21 "Fix finding overflowed PMC in interrupt" we added
a printk() to the PMU exception handler. Unfortunately that is not safe.
The problem is that the PMU exception may run even when interrupts are
soft disabled, aka NMI context. We do this so that we can profile parts
of the kernel that have interrupts soft-disabled.
But by calling printk() from the exception handler, we can potentially
deadlock in the printk code on logbuf\_lock, eg:

powerpc/hw\_breakpoints: Add DABRX cpu feature to fix 32-bit regression
commit 82a9f16adc12f51c3f8ea59a7c3c120241aff836 upstream.
When introducing support for DABRX in 4474ef0, we broke older 32-bit CPUs
that don't have that register.
Some CPUs have a DABR but not DABRX. Configuration are:
- No 32bit CPUs have DABRX but some have DABR.
- POWER4+ and below have the DABR but no DABRX.
- 970 and POWER5 and above have DABR and DABRX.
- POWER8 has DAWR, hence no DABRX.
This introduces CPU\_FTR\_DABRX and sets it on appropriate CPUs. We use
the top 64 bits for CPU FTR bits since only 64 bit CPUs have this.
Processors that don't have the DABRX will still work as they will fall
back to software filtering these breakpoints via perf\_exclude\_event().

powerpc/eeh: Don't check RTAS token to get PE addr
commit b8b3de224f194005ad87ede6fd022fcc2bef3b1a upstream.
RTAS token "ibm,get-config-addr-info" or ibm,get-config-addr-info2"
are used to retrieve the PE address according to PCI address, which
made up of domain/bus/slot/function. If we don't have those 2 tokens,
the domain/bus/slot/function would be used as the address for EEH
RTAS operations. Some older f/w might not have those 2 tokens and
that blocks the EEH functionality to be initialized. It was introduced
by commit e2af155c ("powerpc/eeh: pseries platform EEH initialization").
The patch skips the check on those 2 tokens so we can bring up EEH
functionality successfully. And domain/bus/slot/function will be
used as address for EEH RTAS operations.

ARM: 7747/1: pcpu: ensure \_\_my\_cpu\_offset cannot be re-ordered across barrier()
commit 509eb76ebf9771abc9fe51859382df2571f11447 upstream.
\_\_my\_cpu\_offset is non-volatile, since we want its value to be cached
when we access several per-cpu variables in a row with preemption
disabled. This means that we rely on preempt\_{en,dis}able to hazard
with the operation via the barrier() macro, so that we can't end up
migrating CPUs without reloading the per-cpu offset.
Unfortunately, GCC doesn't treat a "memory" clobber on a non-volatile
asm block as a side-effect, and will happily re-order it before other
memory clobbers (including those in prempt\_disable()) and cache the
value. This has been observed to break the cmpxchg logic in the slub
allocator, leading to livelock in kmem\_cache\_alloc in mainline kernels.
This patch adds a dummy memory input operand to \_\_my\_cpu\_offset,
forcing it to be ordered with respect to the barrier() macro.

ARM: 7743/1: compressed/head.S: work around new binutils warning
commit da94a829305f1c217cfdf6771cb1faca0917e3b9 upstream.
In August 2012, Matthew Gretton-Dann checked a change into binutils
labelled "Error on obsolete & warn on deprecated registers", apparently as
part of ARMv8 support. Apparently, this was supposed to emit the message
"Warning: This coprocessor register access is deprecated in ARMv8" when
using certain mcr/mrc instructions and building for ARMv8. Unfortunately,
the message that is actually emitted appears to be '(null)', which is
less helpful in comparison.
Even more unfortunately, this is biting us on every single kernel
build with a new gas, because arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S and some
other files in that directory are built with -march=all since kernel
commit 80cec14a8 "[ARM] Add -march=all to assembly file build in
arch/arm/boot/compressed" back in v2.6.28.
This patch reverts Russell's nice solution and instead marks the head.S
file to be built for armv7-a, which fortunately lets us build all
instructions in that file without warnings even on the broken binutils.
Without this patch, building anything results in:

ARM: Kirkwood: TS219: Fix crash by double PCIe instantiation
commit e89b4058096569c999fa599370162022a5a2b3d2 upstream.
When creating the DT based boards-ts219.c the none DT ts219-setup.c
was used as a template. This includes a lateinit() call to initialize
the PCIe bus. The code makes use of machine\_is\_ts219() which is never
true on DT, so a FIXME was added and the code left as is. This was
unproblematic until b73690c8f8b5d: "ARM: Kirkwood: Support basic
hotplug for PCI-E" which changes the way the PCIe bus is
initialized. The non-DT ts219-setup.c now crashes during boot. The
lateinit() call in the DT boards-ts219.c is being called,
machine\_is\_ts219() is true and so the PCIe is initialized a second
time.
This patch removes the useless, and now clearly dangerous, code from
boards-ts219.c, making ts219-setup.c work again.

ALSA: hda - Allow setting automute/automic hooks after parsing
commit 77afe0e94884ae40de29cd813a1fb7ddee583591 upstream.
Some codec drivers (VIA codecs and some Realtek fixups) set the
automute and automic hooks after calling
snd\_hda\_gen\_parse\_auto\_config(). In the current code, the hook
pointers are referred only in snd\_hda\_gen\_parse\_auto\_config() and
passed to snd\_hda\_jack\_detect\_enable\_callback(), thus changing the
hook values won't change the actually called callbacks properly.
This patch fixes this bug by setting the static functions as the
primary callback functions for the jack detection, and let them
calling the appropriate hooks dynamically.

ALSA: hda/via - Fix wrongly cleared pins after suspend on VT1802
commit 5a6f294e87974e6ec68d7113553ffd975d83bf15 upstream.
VIA driver has a special suspend handling only for VT1802 to reduce
the pop noise. During the transition to the generic parser, the
behavior of snd\_hda\_set\_pin\_ctl() was also changed to modify the
cached values, too. And this caused a regression where the pin is
still cleared even after the resume (including the resume from power
save), resulting in the silent output.
The fix is simply to replace snd\_hda\_set\_pin\_ctl() with the explicit
call of snd\_hda\_codec\_write() again.

Since the transition to the generic parser, the actual routes used
there don't match always with the assumed static paths in some
set\_widgets\_power\_state callbacks. This results in the wrong power
setup in the end. As a temporary workaround, we need to disable the
calls together with the non-functional dynamic power control enum.

ACPI / scan: do not match drivers against objects having scan handlers
commit 9f29ab11ddbfc12db54df5a66dab22b39ad94e8e upstream.
With the introduction of ACPI scan handlers, an ACPI device object
with an ACPI scan handler attached to it must not be bound to an ACPI
driver any more. Therefore it doesn't make sense to match those
ACPI device objects against a newly registered ACPI driver in
acpi\_bus\_match(), so make that function return 0 if the device
object passed to it has an ACPI scan handler attached.
This also addresses a regression related to a broken ACPI table in
the BIOS, where it has defined a \_ROM method under the PCI root
bridge object. This causes the video module to treat that object
as a display controller device (since only display devices are
supposed to have a \_ROM method defined according to the ACPI spec).
As a result, the ACPI video driver binds to the PCI root bridge
object and overwrites the previously assigned driver\_data field of
it, causing subsequent calls to acpi\_get\_pci\_dev() to fail.

acpi-cpufreq: set current frequency based on target P-State
commit 8673b83bf2f013379453b4779047bf3c6ae387e4 upstream.
Commit 4b31e774 (Always set P-state on initialization) fixed bug
#4634 and caused the driver to always set the target P-State at
least once since the initial P-State may not be the desired one.
Commit 5a1c0228 (cpufreq: Avoid calling cpufreq driver's target()
routine if target\_freq == policy->cur) caused a regression in
this behavior.
This fixes the regression by setting policy->cur based on the CPU's
target frequency rather than the CPU's current reported frequency
(which may be different). This means that the P-State will be set
initially if the CPU's target frequency is different from the
governor's target frequency.
This fixes an issue where setting the default governor to
performance wouldn't correctly enable turbo mode on all cores.

USB: revert periodic scheduling bugfix
commit fdc03438f53a00294ed9939eb3a1f6db6f3d8963 upstream.
This patch reverts commit 3e619d04159be54b3daa0b7036b0ce9e067f4b5d
(USB: EHCI: fix bug in scheduling periodic split transfers). The
commit was valid -- it fixed a real bug -- but the periodic scheduler
in ehci-hcd is in such bad shape (especially the part that handles
split transactions) that fixing one bug is very likely to cause
another to surface. That's what happened in this case; the result was
choppy and noisy playback on certain 24-bit audio devices.
The only real fix will be to rewrite this entire section of code. My
next project...
This fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1136110.

Salisbury and Tyson Tan for tracking down the original source of the

when a URB is being handled it may happen that the static use\_sg flag

x86/PCI: Map PCI setup data with ioremap() so it can be in highmem
commit 65694c5aaddfedd9da082e4e150cafc6b3fc8a6a upstream.
f9a37be0f0 ("x86: Use PCI setup data") added support for using PCI ROM
images from setup\_data. This used phys\_to\_virt(), which is not valid for
highmem addresses, and can cause a crash when booting a 32-bit kernel via
the EFI boot stub.
pcibios\_add\_device() assumes that the physical addresses stored in
setup\_data are accessible via the direct kernel mapping, and that calling
phys\_to\_virt() is valid. This isn't guaranteed to be true on x86 where the
direct mapping range is much smaller than on x86-64.
Calling phys\_to\_virt() on a highmem address results in the following:
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 39a3c198
IP: [] pcibios\_add\_device+0x2f/0x90
...
Call Trace:
[] pci\_device\_add+0xe3/0x130

[] pci\_acpi\_scan\_root+0x2c0/0x490
[] acpi\_pci\_root\_add+0x312/0x42f
...
The solution is to use ioremap() instead of phys\_to\_virt() to map the
setup data into the kernel address space.

xhci: Disable D3cold for buggy TI redrivers.
commit c3897aa5386faba77e5bbdf94902a1658d3a5b11 upstream.
Some xHCI hosts contain a "redriver" from TI that silently drops port
status connect changes if the port slips into Compliance Mode. If the
port slips into compliance mode while the host is in D0, there will not
be a port status change event. If the port slips into compliance mode
while the host is in D3, the host will not send a PME. This includes
when the system is suspended (S3) or hibernated (S4).
If this happens when the system is in S3/S4, there is nothing software
can do. Other port status change events that would normally cause the
host to wake the system from S3/S4 may also be lost. This includes
remote wakeup, disconnects and connects on other ports, and overrcurrent
events. A decision was made to \_NOT\_ disable system suspend/hibernate
on these systems, since users are unlikely to enable wakeup from S3/S4
for the xHCI host.
Software can deal with this issue when the system is in S0. A work
around was put in to poll the port status registers for Compliance Mode.
The xHCI driver will continue to poll the registers while the host is
runtime suspended. Unfortunately, that means we can't allow the PCI
device to go into D3cold, because power will be removed from the host,
and the config space will read as all Fs.
Disable D3cold in the xHCI PCI runtime suspend function.

xhci-mem: init list heads at the beginning of init
commit 331de00a64e5027365145bdf51da27b9ce15dfd5 upstream.
It is possible that we fail on xhci\_mem\_init, just before doing
the INIT\_LIST\_HEAD, and calling xhci\_mem\_cleanup.
Problem is that, the list\_for\_each\_entry\_safe macro, assumes
list heads are initialized (not NULL), and dereferences their 'next'
pointer, causing a kernel panic if this is not yet initialized.
Let's protect from that by moving inits to the beginning.

xhci - correct comp\_mode\_recovery\_timer on return from hibernate
commit 77df9e0b799b03e1d5d9c68062709af5f637e834 upstream.
Commit 71c731a2 (usb: host: xhci: Fix Compliance Mode on SN65LVPE502CP
Hardware) was a workaround for systems using the SN65LVPE502CP,
controller, but it introduced a bug in resume from hibernate.
The fix created a timer, comp\_mode\_recovery\_timer, which is deleted from
a timer list when xhci\_suspend() is called. However, the hibernate image,
including the timer list containing the comp\_mode\_recovery\_timer, had
already been saved before the timer was deleted.
Upon resume from hibernate, the list containing the comp\_mode\_recovery\_timer
is restored from the image saved to disk, and xhci\_resume(), assuming that
the timer had been deleted by xhci\_suspend(), makes a call to
compliance\_mode\_recoery\_timer\_init(), which creates a new instance of the
comp\_mode\_recovery\_timer and attempts to place it into the same list in which
it is already active, thus corrupting the list during the list\_add() call.
At this point, a call trace is emitted indicating the list corruption.
Soon afterward, the system locks up, the watchdog times out, and the
ensuing NMI crashes the system.
The problem did not occur when resuming from suspend. In suspend, the
image in RAM remains exactly as it was when xhci\_suspend() deleted the
comp\_mode\_recovery\_timer, so there is no problem when xhci\_resume()
creates a new instance of this timer and places it in the still empty
list.
This patch avoids the problem by deleting the timer in xhci\_resume()
when resuming from hibernate. Now xhci\_resume() can safely make the
call to create a new instance of this timer, whether returning from
suspend or hibernate.
Thanks to Alan Stern for his help with understanding the problem.
[Sarah reworked this patch to cover the case where the xHCI restore
register operation fails, and (temp & STS\_SRE) is true (and we re-init
the host, including re-init for the compliance mode), but hibernate is
false. The original patch would have caused list corruption in this
case.]

If the glue layer is removed first (core layer later),
it deletes the phy device first, then the core device.
But at core's removal, it still uses PHY's resources, it may
cause kernel's oops. It is much like the problem

Besides, it is reasonable the PHY is deleted at last as
