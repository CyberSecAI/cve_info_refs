Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw in the `Auth/Yadis/XML.php` file of the PHP OpenID Library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The library is vulnerable to XXE injection because it processes untrusted XML data (XRDS data) without properly disabling external entity processing. Specifically, it doesn't disable external entities before parsing the XML. This allows an attacker to include malicious external entities in the XML data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Intranet Server HTTP Requests:** The attacker can also use the vulnerability to send HTTP requests to internal servers within the network.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Excessive consumption of CPU and memory resources, leading to denial of service due to processing malicious XML.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
- **Malicious XRDS Data:** The attacker crafts malicious XRDS data containing an external entity declaration and an entity reference. This malicious data is then processed by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to send the malicious XRDS data to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of XXE:** The attacker must be familiar with XXE injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
- **Mid-High level of expertise** is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects PHP OpenID Library versions 2.2.2 and earlier.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves disabling external XML entities and libxml errors during the XML parsing process.
- The vulnerability was reported by Takeshi Terada and Kosuke Ebihara.
