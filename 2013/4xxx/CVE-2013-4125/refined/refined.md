Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4125:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the IPv6 routing code within the Linux kernel, specifically in the `fib6_add_rt2node()` function. When two router advertisement (RA) speakers announce separate default gateways with infinite timeout, the kernel incorrectly groups these routes into an Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) route set. A subsequent change to the advertised expiration time by one of the RA speakers and the addition of a third route with infinite timeout triggers a `BUG_ON` assertion, causing a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect handling of IPv6 routes with infinite timeouts in the `fib6_add_rt2node()` function
- Failure to properly manage routes within ECMP sets when expiration times are modified
- Lack of proper validation before adding routes to the ECMP set

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to crash the system by triggering a kernel panic, leading to a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered via crafted router advertisements (RAs) that manipulate default gateway announcements and their expiration times.
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious RAs to a vulnerable system to trigger the bug.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be in a network position to send malicious IPv6 RA packets to the target system.
- No special privileges are required on the target system for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel version v3.7-rc1.
- The fix involves ensuring only static routes are considered for ECMP, and filters routes using the flags `RTF_GATEWAY|RTF_ADDRCONF|RTF_DYNAMIC`, which don't change after route construction.
- Red Hat has stated that this vulnerability does not affect their Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and MRG 2 products.
