ipv6: only static routes qualify for equal cost multipathing

```
Static routes in this case are non-expiring routes which did not get
configured by autoconf or by icmpv6 redirects.

To make sure we actually get an ecmp route while searching for the first
one in this fib6_node's leafs, also make sure it matches the ecmp route
assumptions.

v2:
a) Removed RTF_EXPIRE check in dst.from chain. The check of RTF_ADDRCONF
   already ensures that this route, even if added again without
   RTF_EXPIRES (in case of a RA announcement with infinite timeout),
   does not cause the rt6i_nsiblings logic to go wrong if a later RA
   updates the expiration time later.

v3:
a) Allow RTF_EXPIRES routes to enter the ecmp route set. We have to do so,
   because an pmtu event could update the RTF_EXPIRES flag and we would
   not count this route, if another route joins this set. We now filter
   only for RTF_GATEWAY|RTF_ADDRCONF|RTF_DYNAMIC, which are flags that
   don't get changed after rt6_info construction.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=984664#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-07-15 16:16:51 UTC  ``` If two router advertisment speaker announce seperate default gateways with infinite timeout the kernel currently packs these routes together into an ecmp route set. If one of the RA speaker now changes the advertised expiration to a lower value and a third route with infinite timeout pops up we end up with a BUG_ON.  Remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.  Fixed by: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=307f2fb95e9b96b3577916e73d92e104f8f26494>  Introduced by: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=51ebd3181572af8d5076808dab2682d800f6da5d>  Introduced in upstream version: v3.7-rc1  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Hannes Frederic Sowa for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=984664#c1)  Petr Matousek    2013-07-15 16:19:28 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.  This issue did not affect the kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=984664#c3)  Petr Matousek    2013-07-15 16:26:04 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 984668](show_bug.cgi?id=984668 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2013-4125 kernel: kernel: ipv6: BUG_ON in fib6_add_rt2node() [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
