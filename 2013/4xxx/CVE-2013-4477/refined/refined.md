This is unlike the SQL backend, which would correctly return a 404 error.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The LDAP backend logic for role removal does not properly check if the role is already assigned to the user before processing the removal request.\n- Incorrect behavior in handling role removal for non-existent roles, leading to unintended role grants.\n- Inconsistency in behavior between LDAP and SQL backends.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Unintentional granting of roles to users.\n- Attackers could use social engineering to acquire additional roles, or roles can be granted accidentally.\n- Only Keystone setups that employ the LDAP backend are susceptible.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- An attacker with administrative privileges attempts to remove a role from a user using the Keystone API, where the targeted user does not have the role assigned on the specified tenant. This triggers the flawed logic in the LDAP backend, resulting in role assignment instead of role removal or an error.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker requires valid administrator credentials or similar permissions within OpenStack to manage role assignments for users on tenants.\n- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the OpenStack Keystone API."
