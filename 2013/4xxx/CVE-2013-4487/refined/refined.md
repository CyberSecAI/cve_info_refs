Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an off-by-one error in the libdane library, which is part of the GnuTLS library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An off-by-one error leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided text does not specify the impact of exploitation beyond the possibility of a buffer overflow. Typically, buffer overflows can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The provided text does not provide specific details about the attack vector. However, it is implied that the vulnerability exists in the handling of data within the libdane component, which is related to DNSSEC and DANE. An attacker could potentially exploit this through a carefully crafted network packet or data input to the affected function, which could cause a buffer overflow when processing DANE records in TLS handshakes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position where they can influence the DANE records being processed by the vulnerable system (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack or by controlling the DNS server that supplies DANE information).
