    },
    "OfficialDescription": "The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a remote display protocol for virtual environments. SPICE users can access a virtualized desktop or server from the local system or any system with network access to the server. SPICE is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors.\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the reds\_handle\_ticket() function in the spice-server library handled decryption of ticket data provided by the client. A remote user able to initiate a SPICE connection to an application acting as a SPICE server could use this flaw to crash the application.",
