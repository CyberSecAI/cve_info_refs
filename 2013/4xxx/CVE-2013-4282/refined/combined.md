Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4130 CVE-2013-4282
Debian Bug     : 717030 728314

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in spice, a SPICE protocol
client and server library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2013-4130

  David Gibson of Red Hat discovered that SPICE incorrectly handled
  certain network errors. A remote user able to initiate a SPICE
  connection to an application acting as a SPICE server could use this
  flaw to crash the application.

CVE-2013-4282

  Tomas Jamrisko of Red Hat discovered that SPICE incorrectly handled
  long passwords in SPICE tickets. A remote user able to initiate a
  SPICE connection to an application acting as a SPICE server could use
  this flaw to crash the application.

Applications acting as a SPICE server must be restarted for this update
to take effect.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.11.0-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.4-0nocelt2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.4-0nocelt2.

We recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.

## Topic

An updated spice-server package that fixes one security issue is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
remote display protocol for virtual environments. SPICE users can access a
virtualized desktop or server from the local system or any system with
network access to the server. SPICE is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for
viewing virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine
(KVM) hypervisor or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors.

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the
reds\_handle\_ticket() function in the spice-server library handled
decryption of ticket data provided by the client. A remote user able to
initiate a SPICE connection to an application acting as a SPICE server
could use this flaw to crash the application. (CVE-2013-4282)

This issue was discovered by Tomas Jamrisko of Red Hat.

All spice-server users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

# RHSA-2013:1460 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor6 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1460)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes one security issue and
various bugs is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

Upgrade Note: If you upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor through the 3.2 Manager administration portal, the Host may
appear with the status of "Install Failed". If this happens, place the host
into maintenance mode, then activate it again to get the host back to an
"Up" state

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the
reds\_handle\_ticket() function in the spice-server library handled
decryption of ticket data provided by the client. A remote attacker able to
initiate a SPICE connection to the guest could use this flaw to crash the
guest. (CVE-2013-4282)

This issue was discovered by Tomas Jamrisko of Red Hat.

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

CVE-2013-4162 and CVE-2013-4299 (kernel issues)

CVE-2013-4296 and CVE-2013-4311 (libvirt issues)

CVE-2013-4288 (polkit issue)

This update also contains the fixes from the following advisories:

* vdsm: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-1462.html>
* ovirt-node: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-1461.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570).

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1474)

## Topic

Updated qspice packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
remote display protocol for virtual environments. SPICE users can access a
virtualized desktop or server from the local system or any system with
network access to the server. SPICE is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for
viewing virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine
(KVM) hypervisor or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors.

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the
reds\_handle\_ticket() function in the spice-server library handled
decryption of ticket data provided by the client. A remote user able to
initiate a SPICE connection to an application acting as a SPICE server
could use this flaw to crash the application. (CVE-2013-4282)

This issue was discovered by Tomas Jamrisko of Red Hat.

All qspice users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1000443#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-08-23 13:00:05 UTC  ``` reds_handle_ticket uses a fixed size 'password' buffer for the decrypted password whose size is SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH. However, RSA_private_decrypt which we call for the decryption expects the destination buffer to be at least RSA_size(link->tiTicketing.rsa) bytes long.  An remote attacker able to initiate spice connection to the guest could use this flaw to crash the guest.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Tomas Jamrisko of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1000443#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-29 19:34:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:1474 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1474.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1000443#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-29 19:35:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1473 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1473.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1000443#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-29 19:36:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2013:1460 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1460.html>   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

rhev 3.2.4 - vdsm bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Bug Fix Advisory

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHBA-2013%3A1462)

## Topic

Updated vdsm packages that fix various bugs are now available.

## Description

VDSM is a management module that serves as a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Manager agent on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor or Red Hat
Enterprise Linux hosts.

This update fixes the following bugs:

* Non-numeric characters were not allowed for network names, but some VLAN

interfaces with the string "-fcoe" are required by the bnx2fc driver.
Consequently, VDSM could not activate hosts with these VLAN names. This update
introduces "hidden\_vlans" key configuration, allowing VDSM to skip VLAN devices
with names which are not in the expected format. (BZ#1001372)

* Previously, supervdsm used ctime (the time of the last status change) to

define the start time of each process. The ctime value could change as the
process was running, resulting in hosts becoming non-responsive with the error
"AuthenticationError: digest sent was rejected". Now, field 21 (the process
creation time) is used to define the start time of each process, so this error
no longer presents. (BZ#1011661)

All users managing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Virtualization hosts using Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager are advised to install these updated packages,
which fix these issues.

These updated packages will be provided to users of Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor in the next rhev-hypervisor6 errata package.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Virtualization 3.2 x86\_64
* Red Hat Virtualization 3 for RHEL 6 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1011661](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1011661)
  - Supervdsm "AuthenticationError: digest sent was rejected" Tracebacks on several hosts at the same time

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=848279#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2013-10-30 13:01:31 UTC  ``` CVE-2013-4282, via rh bugzilla and linux-distros    From 3554c19d1c65c2bc4ae8cadb7296256c03215257 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 From: Christophe Fergeau <cfergeau@redhat.com> Subject: [PATCH] Fix buffer overflow when decrypting client SPICE ticket  reds_handle_ticket uses a fixed size 'password' buffer for the decrypted password whose size is SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH. However, RSA_private_decrypt which we call for the decryption expects the destination buffer to be at least RSA_size(link->tiTicketing.rsa) bytes long. On my spice-server build, SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH is 60 while RSA_size() is 128, so we end up overflowing 'password' when using long passwords (this was reproduced using the string: 'fullscreen=1proxy=#enter proxy here; e.g spice_proxy = http://[proxy]:[port]' as a password).  When the overflow occurs, QEMU dies with: *** stack smashing detected ***: qemu-system-x86_64 terminated  This commit ensures we use a corectly sized 'password' buffer, and that it's correctly nul-terminated so that we can use strcmp instead of strncmp. To keep using strncmp, we'd need to figure out which one of 'password' and 'taTicket.password' is the smaller buffer, and use that size.  ---  server/reds.c | 44 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++------------  1 file changed, 32 insertions(+), 12 deletions(-)  (rest of the patch attached)   References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1000443> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=848279#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2013-10-30 23:00:24 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=848279#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2015-04-01 11:48:13 UTC  ``` this is the fix <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/commit/?id=8af619009660b24e0b41ad26b30289eea288fcc2http://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/commit/?id=8af619009660b24e0b41ad26b30289eea288fcc2>  SLE 12 needs to be fixed, please submit ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=848279#c3)  Cédric Bosdonnat   2015-04-01 12:40:18 UTC  ``` Maintenance request created with the added patch: #54492 ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=848279#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-05-15 16:05:05 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2015:0884-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

rhev 3.2.4 - vdsm bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Bug Fix Advisory

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHBA-2013%3A1462)

## Topic

Updated vdsm packages that fix various bugs are now available.

## Description

VDSM is a management module that serves as a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Manager agent on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor or Red Hat
Enterprise Linux hosts.

This update fixes the following bugs:

* Non-numeric characters were not allowed for network names, but some VLAN

interfaces with the string "-fcoe" are required by the bnx2fc driver.
Consequently, VDSM could not activate hosts with these VLAN names. This update
introduces "hidden\_vlans" key configuration, allowing VDSM to skip VLAN devices
with names which are not in the expected format. (BZ#1001372)

* Previously, supervdsm used ctime (the time of the last status change) to

define the start time of each process. The ctime value could change as the
process was running, resulting in hosts becoming non-responsive with the error
"AuthenticationError: digest sent was rejected". Now, field 21 (the process
creation time) is used to define the start time of each process, so this error
no longer presents. (BZ#1011661)

All users managing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Virtualization hosts using Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager are advised to install these updated packages,
which fix these issues.

These updated packages will be provided to users of Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor in the next rhev-hypervisor6 errata package.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Virtualization 3.2 x86\_64
* Red Hat Virtualization 3 for RHEL 6 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1011661](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1011661)
  - Supervdsm "AuthenticationError: digest sent was rejected" Tracebacks on several hosts at the same time

## Synopsis

ovirt-node bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Bug Fix Advisory

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHBA-2013%3A1461)

## Topic

An updated ovirt-node package that fixes a bug is now available.

## Description

The ovirt-node package provides the utilities and recipes used to create and
configure the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor ISO image.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for the
Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

This update fixes these following bug:

* Previously the Hypervisor upgrade process used the already installed codebase.

Any issues in the existing upgrade script would cause failures, and users would
have to use installation media to correctly upgrade. The new process uses the
new image's codebase to perform the upgrade, preventing this issue. (BZ#1006390)

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to upgrade
to this updated package, which corrects this issue.

This ovirt-node package is included in the rhev-hypervisor6 package associated
with advisory RHSA-2013:1460

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1460.html>

## Solution

relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Fix buffer overflow when decrypting client SPICE ticketreds\_handle\_ticket uses a fixed size 'password' buffer for the decrypted
password whose size is SPICE\_MAX\_PASSWORD\_LENGTH. However,
RSA\_private\_decrypt which we call for the decryption expects the
destination buffer to be at least RSA\_size(link->tiTicketing.rsa)
bytes long. On my spice-server build, SPICE\_MAX\_PASSWORD\_LENGTH
is 60 while RSA\_size() is 128, so we end up overflowing 'password'
when using long passwords (this was reproduced using the string:
'fullscreen=1proxy=#enter proxy here; e.g spice\_proxy = http://[proxy]:[port]'
as a password).
When the overflow occurs, QEMU dies with:
\*\*\* stack smashing detected \*\*\*: qemu-system-x86\_64 terminated
This commit ensures we use a corectly sized 'password' buffer,
and that it's correctly nul-terminated so that we can use strcmp
instead of strncmp. To keep using strncmp, we'd need to figure out
which one of 'password' and 'taTicket.password' is the smaller buffer,
and use that size.
This fixes rhbz#999839
