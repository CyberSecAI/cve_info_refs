Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4322:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided text includes multiple references to CVE-2013-4322 within the context of Apache Tomcat and its handling of chunked transfer encoding, matching the official CVE description: "The fix for CVE-2012-3544 was not complete. It did not cover the following cases:  - chunk extensions were not limited - whitespace after the : in a trailing header was not limited". This indicates that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The incomplete fix for CVE-2012-3544 in Apache Tomcat's handling of chunked transfer encoding. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the lack of limitations on the size of chunk extensions and whitespace after the colon in trailing headers.

*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Improper handling of chunk extensions during chunked transfer encoding.
    *   Improper processing of whitespace characters in HTTP header values within a trailer field.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a crafted request with excessively long chunk extensions or whitespace in header values within the trailer field. This could lead to the Tomcat server becoming unresponsive or resource exhaustion due to unlimited data streaming.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A remote attacker crafts a malicious request with excessively long chunk extensions.
    *   A remote attacker crafts a malicious request with an excessively large number of whitespace characters after the colon in the header values of the trailer.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Tomcat server.
    *   No authentication is required.

**3. Additional Details (beyond CVE description)**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Apache Tomcat versions: 8.0.0-RC10, 7.0.50, and 6.0.39.
*   The bug fix included changes to the code responsible for parsing the chunked transfer encoding and limiting the size of chunk extensions.
*   The fix involved updating the code in files such as `ChunkedInputFilter.java` and modifying how chunked requests are processed.
*   Red Hat also had a similar vulnerability and was addressed in multiple releases.
*   IBM also reported this vulnerability within their Rational Test Control Panel where a custom patch must be applied by the customer.
*   Debian reports addressing it in Tomcat6 packages.
*   The issue affects both the BIO and NIO connectors.

In summary, the provided content contains useful information about a denial of service vulnerability related to chunked transfer encoding and header parsing in Apache Tomcat. The root cause is the incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability and missing checks for chunk extensions and whitespace. This can lead to DoS via request smuggling if behind a reverse proxy. The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests, and no authentication is required.
