Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-4491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the internationalization (i18n) component of Ruby on Rails' Action Pack. Specifically, when a translation for a given string is missing, the i18n gem generates a fallback HTML string. Under specific configurations, this fallback string can include user-supplied input without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data within the fallback HTML string generated by the i18n component. This allows for a reflected XSS attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by providing a specially crafted input string. This script would then execute in the context of a user's browser when the application attempts to display the missing translation, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Defacing the application.
    - Accessing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted user input that triggers a missing translation, leading the i18n component to generate a fallback HTML string.
- The attacker provides this specially crafted input through any parameter or field that the application utilizes with its internationalization component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, requiring no special privileges.
-   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web application.
-   The attacker needs to be able to control input that will be used in generating a missing translation, as this is what gets reflected on the page.

**Additional Notes:**
-  The vulnerability affects Ruby on Rails versions 3.0.6 and later, but not 3.0.5 and earlier.
-  The vulnerability is fixed in Ruby on Rails versions 4.0.2 and 3.2.16.
-  The vulnerability can also be addressed by upgrading the i18n gem to version 0.6.6 (for Rails 4.0.x and 3.2.x) or 0.5.1 (for Rails 3.1.x and 3.0.x).
-  The vulnerability is considered moderate by openSUSE and important by Red Hat.
