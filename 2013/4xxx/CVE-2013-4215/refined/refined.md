Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `check_ipxping.c` plugin in Nagios plugins uses a hardcoded, fixed location (`/tmp/ipxping/ipxping`) for the `IPXPING_COMMAND`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Location:** The use of `/tmp`, a publicly writable directory, to store and execute the command.
*   **Lack of Checks:** The plugin lacks sufficient checks on file permissions and ownership of the executable at the hardcoded path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker could place a malicious executable at the hardcoded location or create a symlink to another command. When `check_ipxping` is run, this malicious code would be executed with the privileges of the Nagios user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where Nagios is running.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to write to the `/tmp` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local user account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the system where the Nagios plugin is executed.
*   **Write access to /tmp:** Ability to create files or symlinks within the `/tmp` directory.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was identified during an audit of OpenStack dependencies.
*   The issue affects `nagios-plugins-1.4.16-6.el6ost` and was confirmed in `nagios-plugins-1.4.16-80-g08f5`.
