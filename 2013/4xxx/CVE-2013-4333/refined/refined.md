Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-4334 (Note: the content mentions CVE-2013-4333 but is actually describing CVE-2013-4334. The content also describes CVE-2013-4335 and CVE-2013-4333 but this analysis focuses on the opWebAPIPlugin commit which is related to CVE-2013-4334)

**Vulnerable Software:** opWebAPIPlugin

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of XML input when processing ATOM/GData documents. Specifically, the code was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The commit disables XML external entities during parsing using `libxml_disable_entity_loader(true)`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The application was parsing XML input without disabling external entities, making it susceptible to XXE attacks. This allowed an attacker to include external entities, potentially leading to the disclosure of local files, internal network enumeration and denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized disclosure of information:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored on the server.
- **Unauthorized modification:** It could be possible to alter or modify data.
- **Disruption of service:**  XXE attacks could be used to trigger denial of service conditions, making the application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network exploitable:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **XML Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending maliciously crafted XML input to the application when parsing ATOM/GData documents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any user authentication.
- **Network access:** Attackers only need to have network access to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
The commit `8820a4a8d7b8c8fbfa4533cc5645f371d454ca5b` addresses the XXE vulnerability by modifying `lib/api/opAtomPubDocument.class.php` and `lib/api/opGDataDocument.class.php`.  The changes involve the following:
- In `opAtomPubDocument.class.php` and `opGDataDocument.class.php`, instead of calling directly `simplexml_load_string`, the code now calls `opAtomPubDocument::loadXml`.
- A new static function `loadXml` was added to `opAtomPubDocument.class.php`. This function disables external entity loading when `opToolkit::loadXmlString` is not available. `libxml_disable_entity_loader(true)` is called before using `simplexml_load_string` which mitigates the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is described in the context of OpenPNE, and the fix was implemented in the `opWebAPIPlugin`.
- The commit message mentions "(OPSA-2013-003) (refs #3384)".
- The fix is implemented by disabling entity loading while processing XML input.
- The provided content includes the commit diff which shows how the code was fixed.
