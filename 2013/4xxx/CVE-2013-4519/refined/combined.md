How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Review Board 1.7.17 Release Notes[¶](#review-board-1-7-17-release-notes "Permalink to this heading")

**Release date**: November 5, 2013

## Security Fixes[¶](#security-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

This release fixes a couple crucial XSS vulnerabilities. We recommend
that everyone upgrade their installs immediately. Special thanks to
Frederik Braun from Mozilla for reporting these to us.

If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them to
security@reviewboard.org.

* Fixed XSS vulnerabilities for the Branch field and
  uploaded file captions. ([CVE-2013-4519](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4519))

  It was possible to construct captions for uploaded files and construct
  a Branch field where the content would be interpreted as HTML.
* Added a `X-Frame-Options` header to prevent clickjacking.

  This header tells modern browsers that Review Board cannot be displayed
  in a frame. While not a security “fix,” it’s a useful prevention
  against [clickjacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking).

## New Features[¶](#new-features "Permalink to this heading")

* Remove the need for SSH keys for GitHub repositories.

  GitHub repositories no longer need SSH keys, simplifying the configuration
  process. Previously, an SSH key had to be configured both on Review Board
  and for the user configured to access the GitHub repositories.

  This is no longer the case. An out-of-the-box install without an SSH key
  will now properly work with any GitHub repository.
* Improved validation for GitHub repositories.

  Review Board wasn’t very helpful when failing to add GitHub repositories,
  often showing “Repository not found” errors.

  Now it will show detailed, meaningful errors when things go wrong.
* Added support for permissions on Local Sites.

  Local Sites now support permissions. While there’s currently no UI for
  setting these, it is possible to modify a `LocalSiteProfile.permissions`
  dictionary to set them.

  Administrators of Local Sites now have all permissions relevant to that
  Local Site, meaning they can edit or close/reopen review requests.

## Performance Improvements[¶](#performance-improvements "Permalink to this heading")

* Reduced query counts on all pages.
* Reduced query counts in the web API when returning empty lists.

## Extensibility[¶](#extensibility "Permalink to this heading")

* Extensions using the `configure_extension` view an now pass in a
  custom `template_name` pointing to a template for the configuration
  page, if it needs additional customization.
* Enabling, disabling or reconfiguring extensions will now invalidate the
  caches for pages, ensuring that hooks will take affect.
* Extension configuration now works properly on subdirectory installs.

## Bug Fixes[¶](#bug-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed showing private review requests on a submitter page.
* The description for submitted or discarded review requests is now
  shown on the diff viewer. ([Bug #2913](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/2913))
* Discarding, reopening and then closing a review request no longer
  makes the review request private. ([Bug #3103](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/3103))
* Fixed a naming conflict with older PyCrypto packages, such as the default
  package on CentOS 6.4. ([Bug #3110](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/3110))
* Users with the `can_change_status` permission no longer need the
  `can_edit_reviewrequest` permission in order to close or reopen
  review requests.
* Switching a repository from using a hosting service to Custom no longer
  reverts back to the hosting service.
* Fixed editing a repository if its associated hosting service can’t be
  loaded (such as if an extension providing that hosting service is
  disabled).
* Many diff validation errors weren’t being shown on the New Review Request
  page, generating 500 errors instead.
* Fixed caching issues with the Blocks field on review requests.
* Editing JSON text fields in the administration UI now works, validates,
  and won’t result in warnings in the log.
* Fixed breakages with looking up URLs internally with Local Sites.

# Review Board 1.6.21 Release Notes[¶](#review-board-1-6-21-release-notes "Permalink to this heading")

**Release date**: November 5, 2013

## Security Fixes[¶](#security-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed XSS vulnerabilities for the Branch field and
  uploaded file captions. ([CVE-2013-4519](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4519))

  It was possible to construct captions for uploaded files and construct
  a Branch field where the content would be interpreted as HTML.

  Thanks to Frederik Braun at Mozilla for reporting this.

## Contributors[¶](#contributors "Permalink to this heading")
