{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw in the way authenticated connections were cached on the server by remote-naming and in the way connections for remote EJB invocations via the EJB client API were cached on the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper connection caching"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could use a remoting client or an EJB client to log in as a previously authenticated user without knowing their password, allowing them to access data and perform actions with the privileges of that user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access using remoting clients",
      "Remote network access using EJB clients"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable server. No specific user credentials are required beyond having access to a previous authentication.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is described as session fixation due to the improper connection caching. This allows attackers to re-use previously authenticated connections."
