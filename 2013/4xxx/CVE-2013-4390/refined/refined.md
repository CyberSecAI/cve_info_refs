Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4390:

**Summary:**

The provided content from the Apache Jira issue tracker (SLING-3141) directly relates to the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-4390. The vulnerability is within the `AbstractAuthenticationFormServlet` of Apache Sling, where the `resource` parameter is not validated for proper redirect targets, allowing for potential open redirect attacks.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `AbstractAuthenticationFormServlet` in Apache Sling does not validate the `resource` parameter, which is used for redirection after successful authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The lack of validation on the `resource` parameter enables an attacker to craft a malicious URL that, upon successful authentication, redirects the user to an arbitrary external site controlled by the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing/Credential Theft:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to redirect users to a fake login page that mimics the original site, potentially stealing credentials.
*   **Malware Delivery:** Attackers could redirect users to sites hosting malicious content, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Loss of Trust:** The vulnerability could be exploited to damage the reputation and trust of the targeted application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a URL that includes a malicious URL in the `resource` parameter, which is then used for redirection after login.
*   The vulnerability is exploited by convincing users to click a malicious link or through other means of providing a crafted URL, such as injecting it into a web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to generate a URL that includes the vulnerable parameter, `resource` with a malicious target as its value.
*   The attacker does not require prior access to the server; this is a client-side exploitation.
*   The attacker can be external.

**Additional details:**
* The fix for this vulnerability was included in  `Auth Core 1.1.4`.
* Related issue `SLING-3443` indicates similar parameter based redirection issues.
