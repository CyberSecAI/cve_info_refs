Hi all,

Chicken 4.8.0.5 is now available for download:

 <http://code.call-cc.org/releases/4.8.0/chicken-4.8.0.5.tar.gz>

This release includes several important security and crash fixes,
after a recent bug-hunting spree by our core hackers.

=== What's new ===

4.8.0.5
- Security fixes
  - CVE-2013-4385: read-string! no longer reads beyond its buffer when
    length is #f.
  - poll() is also used on cygwin by enabling the fix for CVE-2012-6122
  - file-creation-mode now passes a valid value to umask when its argument
    is omitted.  (Also ensure it always returns the old umask value.)
  - Fix a data corruption problem in list->queue.

- Core libraries
  - read-string! behaves correctly in presence of EOF.
  - Several subtle problems in the reader in the presence of EOF are fixed.

- Runtime
  - Fix an issue on initial seed of the random number generator.

==================

The 4.8.0.x releases reside on the stability/4.8.0 branch in git,
which you can retrieve with:

git clone --branch stability/4.8.0 git://code.call-cc.org/chicken-core

Or browse my unofficial github mirror:
<https://github.com/ursetto/chicken-core-stability/tree/stability/4.8.0>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [Chicken-announce] [SECURITY] Buffer overrun in some uses of read-string

Hello CHICKEN users,

A problem was found with the read-string! procedure from the "extras"
unit, when used in a very particular way.  The manual says:

  [procedure] (read-string! NUM STRING [PORT [START]])

  Read or write NUM characters from/to PORT [...]
  If NUM is #f or not given, then all data up to the end-of-file
  is read[...].
  If no more input is available, read-string returns the
  empty string. read-string! reads destructively into the given
  STRING argument, but never more characters than would fit into
  STRING.

[<http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/4/Unit%20extras#read-string>]

It turned out that there was a missing check for the situation when
NUM was #f and the input size to be read from the port exceeded the
given buffer's (STRING's) size.  This will result in a buffer overrun,
which may lead to general corruption of the stack or heap, and
can potentially be used to execute arbitrary code.

The bug was fixed by changeset cd1b9775005ebe220ba11265dbf5396142e65f26
[<http://code.call-cc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=chicken-core.git;a=commit;h=cd1b9775005ebe220ba11265dbf5396142e65f26>]

All currently released CHICKENs are vulnerable to this bug: all stable
versions up until 4.8.0.4, and all development snapshots up until 4.8.2.
CHICKEN 4.9.0 and 4.8.0.5 will include the fix, as will all development
snapshots starting with 4.8.3.

There is a simple workaround to be used in code that uses read-string!:
simply convert all (read-string! #f buf ...) invocations to
(read-string! (string-length buf) buf ...) or, if possible, use the
non-destructive read-string procedure from the same unit.

A quick scan of the egg repository pointed out that so far only
http-client seemed to be using read-string! in this manner.  This
has been fixed in http-client 0.6.1, so all users are advised to
at least upgrade this egg.

Kind regards,
The CHICKEN Team
