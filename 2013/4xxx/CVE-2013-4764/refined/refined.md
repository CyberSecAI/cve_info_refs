Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unprotected component within the `sCloudBackupProvider.apk` application, a pre-installed system app on Samsung Galaxy S3 and S4 devices. This component is unintentionally exposed, allowing other applications to interact with it without proper authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unprotected Component:** The `sCloudBackupProvider.apk` exposes components that lack proper access control.
- **SMS Injection:** The exposed components allow for the creation of arbitrary SMS content, which can be injected directly into the system-wide SMS database.
- **SMS Sending Trigger:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger the built-in SMS sending mechanism, sending crafted SMS messages to any recipient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SMS Sending:** An unprivileged application can send SMS messages with arbitrary content to arbitrary destinations, bypassing the standard permission checks.
- **Smishing Attacks:** Attackers can send crafted SMS messages, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.
- **MMS Messages Affected:** The vulnerability also affects MMS messages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is locally exploitable by any unprivileged app installed on the device.
- **Component Triggering:** Exploitation involves sequentially triggering the exposed components in a specific order.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unprivileged Application:** The attacker needs to have an application installed on the vulnerable device.
- **Knowledge of Component Interaction:** The attacker needs to know the correct sequence of steps to trigger the vulnerability.
