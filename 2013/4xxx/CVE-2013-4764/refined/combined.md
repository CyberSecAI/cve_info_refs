[ç«å³ä¸è½½](../index.html#dlPart)
[å®å¨æ­æ¥]Vulnerability for CVE-2013-4764

1. Overview

In Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, a built-in system app exposes an unprotected component which allows an unprivileged app on the phone to sending out arbitrary SMS text messages to arbitrary destinations without requesting the standard SEND\_SMS permission.

2. Vendor Response

Contact Time: June 10, 2013

Confirm Time: June 17, 2013

Patched Time: TBD

Patched Status: In Progress

3. Impact

1) Access Vector

Local exploitable

2) Access Complexity

Low

3) Authentication

Permissions with normal protection level shall be required to access the corresponding content providers.

4) Impact Type

The vulnerable software allows any unprivileged app to send SMS/MMS messages out to arbitrary destination number with arbitrary content.

4. Vulnerability Details

In Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, a pre-loaded app, i.e., sCloudBackupProvider.apk, is used to provide backup functionality for the users, and it unintentially exposes some unprotected component. These components can be sequentially triggered in a specific order to create arbitrary SMS content, inject to system-wide SMS database, and then trigger the built-in SMS-sending behavior (to arbitrary destination). This vulnerability also affects MMS messages.

5. Vulnerable software and versions

Affected devices:

Galaxy S3 (build #: IMM76D.I9300UBALF5):

Package Name: com.sec.android.sCloudBackupProvider

Version Code: 1

Version Name: 1.0

Galaxy S4 (build #: JDQ39.I9505XXUAMDE and JDQ39.I9500ZCUAMDH):

Package Name: com.sec.android.sCloudBackupProvider

Version Code: 14

Version Name: 1.4

6. Workarounds

QIHU Inc. has tested the following workarounds that does NOT correct the vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before applying the official OTA update from Samsung:

Disable the vulnerable app (sCloudBackupProvider.apk).

Impact: After disabling the app, the built-in cloud backup and restore function of Galaxy S3/S4 will not be avaiable.

```
Hi list,
I would like to inform you that the details of the vulnerability in
built-in system app of Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 (assigned as CVE-2013-4763
and CVE-2013-4764) are now disclosed to public.

In Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, a pre-loaded app, i.e.,
sCloudBackupProvider.apk, is used to provide backup functionality for
the users, and it unintentially exposes several unprotected
components. By exploiting these unprotected components, an
unprivileged app can trigger a so-called “restore” operation to write
SMS messages back to the standard SMS database file (mmssms.db) used
by the system messaging app, i.e., SecMms.apk. As a result, a smishing
attack can effectively create and inject arbitrary (fake) SMS text
messages. Similarly, fake MMS messages and call logs are also
possible. This vulnerability has been disclosed in CVE-2013-4763.

Also, these components can be sequentially triggered in a specific
order to create arbitrary SMS content, inject to system-wide SMS
database, and then trigger the built-in SMS-sending behavior (to
arbitrary destination). This vulnerability has been disclosed in
CVE-2013-4764.

QIHU Inc. discovered these vulnerability and informed Samsung Corp. in
June 10, 2013. Samsung confirmed the vulerability and is now preparing
an OTA update. As a temporary workaround, disable the
sCloudBackupProvider.apk app would help block known attack vectors.

Details of CVE-2013-4763 and CVE-2013-4764 can be also found in QIHU
Inc.'s official site:
<http://shouji.360.cn/securityReportlist/CVE-2013-4763.html>

Z.X. from QIHU Inc.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
