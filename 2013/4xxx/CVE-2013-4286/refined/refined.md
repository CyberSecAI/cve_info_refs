  "CVE-2013-4286": {
    "description": "The fix for CVE-2005-2090 was not complete. It did not cover the following cases: content-length header with chunked encoding over any HTTP connector or multiple content-length headers over any AJP connector. Requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length header when chunked encoding is being used should be rejected as invalid. When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat) process a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain either multiple content-length headers or a content-length header when chunked encoding is being used and several components do not reject the request and make different decisions as to which content-length header to use an attacker can poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own. Tomcat now rejects requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length header when chunked encoding is being used.",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2005-2090 regarding handling of content-length headers, specifically with chunked encoding or multiple content length headers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of HTTP request headers"

    "impact": "Request smuggling, web-cache poisoning, cross-site scripting (XSS), information disclosure",

      "Sending a crafted HTTP request with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length header when chunked encoding is being used"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send a crafted HTTP request, with access to an AJP port or being behind a misconfigured reverse proxy."
