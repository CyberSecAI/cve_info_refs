  "CVE-2013-4332": {
    "description": "Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were found in glibc's memory allocator functions (pvalloc, valloc, and memalign). If an application used such a function, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in glibc's memory allocation functions (pvalloc, valloc, and memalign)",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Application crash, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker able to make an application resolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause the application to exhaust all stack memory and crash.",
      "A large bytes parameter to pvalloc/valloc/memalign could cause an integer overflow and corrupt allocator internals."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "A local attacker with the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path."
