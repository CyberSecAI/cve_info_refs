Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the "function to customize the top page" of Cybozu Office. This indicates that user-supplied input used in customizing the top page is not properly sanitized or encoded, which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw, specifically a reflected XSS, as the malicious script is injected through the customization function and executed in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of Arbitrary Scripts: A successful attack allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the web browser of a logged-in user.
- Potential for Malicious Actions: This could lead to various malicious actions such as:
    - Session hijacking: stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Phishing: redirecting users to fake login pages.
    - Data theft: accessing sensitive data within the application.
    - Defacement: altering the appearance of the application.
    - Further attacks: Using the compromised session to perform actions on behalf of the user.
