Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4509:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Input Method Editors (IMEs) not properly obscuring password entries in GNOME lock screens. Specifically, IBus versions 1.5.4 and possibly 1.5.2 do not correctly handle the `IBus.InputPurpose.PASSWORD` flag, causing passwords to be displayed as plain text. This is due to the IME not correctly communicating the input purpose to the GNOME shell password dialog, which results in characters being visible rather than being masked.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of the `IBus.InputPurpose.PASSWORD` flag.
- Lack of proper communication between IME and the GNOME shell password dialog regarding the input purpose.
- The IME does not disable character visibility during password entry.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Passwords entered using affected IMEs are displayed in plain text on the GNOME lock screen.
- This exposes user passwords to anyone with physical access to the locked machine.
- An attacker can easily see the password characters being typed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to a locked GNOME desktop environment using a vulnerable IME.
- The attack is performed by simply typing the password into the login screen while the vulnerability is present.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires physical access to a machine running a vulnerable version of IBus and a vulnerable IME, along with GNOME 3.6 or later.
- The attacker must be present at the login screen while the victim is typing their password.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue affects multiple IMEs, including ibus-mozc, ibus-anthy, ibus-pinyin, and ibus-chewing.
- The vulnerability is triggered by changes in IBus, so it only affects engines when used with IBus >= 1.5.4 (or 1.5.2) and GNOME 3.6+.
- Patches were created to address this issue by adding support for input purpose and disabling the visibility of typed characters when `IBus.InputPurpose.PASSWORD` is set.
- The fix involves setting the correct input purpose in the IME so that the GNOME shell properly masks password input.
- The vulnerability was fixed in ibus-anthy (in the provided commit), ibus-mozc, ibus-pinyin, and ibus-chewing.

The provided content contains a commit log from `ibus-anthy`, a bug report on redhat's bugzilla, and mailing lists archives from opensuse showing the fixes to address this vulnerability in various IMEs. It provides significantly more detail than the generic CVE description.
