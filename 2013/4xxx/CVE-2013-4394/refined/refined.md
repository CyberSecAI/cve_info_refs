Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `SetX11Keyboard()` function in systemd did not properly sanitize X Keyboard Extension (XKB) layout descriptions. Specifically, it failed to filter out special and control characters from the layout description.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in `SetX11Keyboard()` when processing XKB layout descriptions. This allows for injection of arbitrary characters.
- **Privilege Escalation:** When PolicyKit Local Authority (PKLA) is used to grant users permission to change XKB settings, this flaw allows a local attacker within that group to inject malicious data into the Xorg X11 Server configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Configuration Modification:** An attacker can inject arbitrary values into the Xorg X11 Server configuration file, potentially modifying or injecting malicious configurations.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting malicious configurations, an attacker can potentially escalate their privileges on the system.
- **Unauthorized Xorg X11 Server Configuration Modification/Injection:** An attacker could modify the Xorg X11 Server configuration file, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack is local and requires the attacker to be a member of a group that has been granted permission to change XKB settings using PKLA (PolicyKit Local Authority).
- **Malicious XKB Layout Descriptions:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by providing maliciously crafted XKB layout descriptions that contain special and control characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **PolicyKit Authorization:** The attacker must be a member of a group that has the authorization to change XKB settings via PolicyKit local authority.
- **Knowledge of XKB Layouts:** Some understanding of XKB layout description syntax is required to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.
- The vulnerability was addressed in systemd versions shipped with Fedora 18 and 19.
- An upstream patch was released to fix the sanitization issue.
- Debian also released a security update to address the issue in their distribution.

In summary, CVE-2013-4394 describes an improper sanitization flaw in systemd that can lead to a privilege escalation vulnerability when using a specific PolicyKit configuration and allows local attackers to inject arbitrary data into the Xorg configuration.
