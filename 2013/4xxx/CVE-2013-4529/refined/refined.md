{
  "CVE-2013-4529": {
    "Description": "Multiple buffer overflow, input validation, and out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way virtio, virtio-net, virtio-scsi, usb, and hpet drivers of QEMU handled state loading after migration. A user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during state loading after migration in the `hw/pci/pcie_aer.c` file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds Write",
	  "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker who can alter the savevm data (either on disk or during migration) can corrupt QEMU process memory on the destination host, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "Attack vector": "The attack vector is through a malicious savevm data stream, either on disk or over the network during a migration process.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the savevm data that QEMU is loading. This could involve compromising the source host for a migration, or altering saved state files."
