Package        : putty
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4206 CVE-2013-4207 CVE-2013-4208 CVE-2013-4852
Debian Bug     : 718779

Several vulnerabilities where discovered in PuTTY, a Telnet/SSH client
for X. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2013-4206

    Mark Wooding discovered a heap-corrupting buffer underrun bug in the
    modmul function which performs modular multiplication. As the modmul
    function is called during validation of any DSA signature received
    by PuTTY, including during the initial key exchange phase, a
    malicious server could exploit this vulnerability before the client
    has received and verified a host key signature. An attack to this
    vulnerability can thus be performed by a man-in-the-middle between
    the SSH client and server, and the normal host key protections
    against man-in-the-middle attacks are bypassed.

CVE-2013-4207

    It was discovered that non-coprime values in DSA signatures can
    cause a buffer overflow in the calculation code of modular inverses
    when verifying a DSA signature. Such a signature is invalid. This
    bug however applies to any DSA signature received by PuTTY,
    including during the initial key exchange phase and thus it can be
    exploited by a malicious server before the client has received and
    verified a host key signature.

CVE-2013-4208

    It was discovered that private keys were left in memory after being
    used by PuTTY tools.

CVE-2013-4852

    Gergely Eberhardt from SEARCH-LAB Ltd. discovered that PuTTY is
    vulnerable to an integer overflow leading to heap overflow during
    the SSH handshake before authentication due to improper bounds
    checking of the length parameter received from the SSH server. A
    remote attacker could use this vulnerability to mount a local denial
    of service attack by crashing the putty client.

Additionally this update backports some general proactive potentially
security-relevant tightening from upstream.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.60+2010-02-20-1+squeeze2. This update also provides a fix for
CVE-2011-4607, which was fixed for stable already.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.62-9+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.63-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your putty packages.

Subject: CVE request: three additional flaws fixed in putty 0.63

There seem to be some CVEs needed for putty 0.63 due to some other fixes
that were fixed alongside CVE-2013-4852:

* a heap-corrupting buffer underrun bug in the modmul function which performs modular multiplication:
<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-modmul.html>
<http://svn.tartarus.org/sgt?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=9977>

* A buffer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of modular inverses when verifying a DSA signature:
<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-bignum-division-by-zero.html>
<http://svn.tartarus.org/sgt?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=9996>

* Private keys left in memory after being used by PuTTY tools:
<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/private-key-not-wiped.html>
<http://svn.tartarus.org/sgt?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=9988>

I can't see any CVE references so I suspect there are none.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
