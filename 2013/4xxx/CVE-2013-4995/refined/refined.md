Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input when executing SQL queries. Specifically, the HTML output of the SQL query results was not properly escaped, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. A crafted SQL query could inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML output displayed to the user.
- **Unescaped HTML Output:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of HTML output when displaying the results of a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS Execution:** An attacker could inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a phpMyAdmin user's browser session.
- **Account Compromise:**  A successful XSS attack could potentially allow an attacker to steal session cookies, hijack user accounts, or perform actions on behalf of the compromised user.
- **Data Manipulation:** Malicious JavaScript could be used to modify data within the phpMyAdmin interface, depending on the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted SQL Query:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious SQL query that contains JavaScript code within the data that will be displayed by phpMyAdmin in the results.
- **SQL Query Execution:** A logged-in user must execute the crafted SQL query in phpMyAdmin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **phpMyAdmin Access:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to execute SQL queries within phpMyAdmin.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker must be able to create malicious SQL queries that produce the desired output of the injected JavaScript code in the phpMyAdmin interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text indicates that this is considered a "non-critical" vulnerability due to the requirement of being logged in to phpMyAdmin, this does not change the fact that it is still an XSS vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in phpMyAdmin versions 3.5.8.2 and 4.0.4.2 and later, and patches were applied to the affected versions.
*   The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-4995.
*   The issue was reported by Micha≈Ç Bentkowski.
*   CWE-661 (Incorrect Object Initialization) and CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) are associated with this vulnerability.
