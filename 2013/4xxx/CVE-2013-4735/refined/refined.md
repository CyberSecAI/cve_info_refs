The provided content relates to CVE-2013-4735.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the inclusion of a shared private root SSH key within publicly available firmware images of Digital Alert Systems DASDEC and Monroe Electronics R189 One-Net Emergency Alert System (EAS) devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Compromised root SSH key (CWE-798, CWE-321):** Publicly available firmware images included a private root SSH key authorized to log in to the devices.
-   **Predictable session ID (Potentially):** The administrative web server might use predictable, monotonically increasing session IDs, but this finding was not consistently reproducible by Monroe Electronics.
-   **Log information disclosure (CWE-532):** Logs available via the web server could disclose configuration, operation, and status information.
-    **Predictable password generation (CWE-341):** Passwords generated by `dasdec_mkuser` script are created in a deterministic way.
-   **Default passwords:** The devices use default administrative credentials, which might not be changed by users, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   An attacker with the private key and SSH access can log in with root privileges, gaining full control of the device.
-   Predictable session IDs could allow an attacker to hijack an existing administrative web session.
-   Predictable and unchanged default passwords can allow an attacker to gain device access, possibly with root privileges.
-   Exposed logs may disclose configuration information that can benefit an attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
-   An attacker needs to obtain the publicly available firmware image containing the compromised SSH key.
-   The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device's SSH service.
-   An attacker could exploit predictable session IDs by intercepting and using a valid session ID.
-   An attacker can use default passwords to gain access if these were not changed by the user and the device is reachable through the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   Attacker needs access to the firmware image.
-   Attacker requires network connectivity to the device's SSH port or the administrative web interface.
-   For the SSH key exploit, the attacker needs the compromised private key.
-   For default password exploit, attacker needs knowledge of default credentials.
-   For session hijacking, attacker needs to be on the network and be able to intercept/guess session ids.
