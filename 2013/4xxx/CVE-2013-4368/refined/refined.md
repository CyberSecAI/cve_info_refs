{
  "CVE-2013-4368": {
    "Description": "The emulation of the outs instruction for 64-bit PV guests uses an uninitialized variable as the segment base for the source data if an FS: or GS: segment override is used, and if the segment descriptor the respective non-null selector in the corresponding selector register points to cannot be read by the emulation code (this is possible if the segment register was loaded before a more recent GDT or LDT update, i.e. the segment register contains stale data).",
    "Root cause": "The outs instruction emulation in Xen uses an uninitialized variable as the segment base when FS: or GS: segment override is used and the segment descriptor cannot be read.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of uninitialized variable",
      "Improper handling of stale segment register data"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious 64-bit PV guest might be able to read hypervisor stack memory, potentially gaining access to sensitive data relating to other guests.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious 64-bit PV guest using the outs instruction with FS or GS segment override.",
     "Leveraging the fault address passed to the page fault handler when outs instruction raises a fault."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have control of a 64-bit PV guest."
  }
