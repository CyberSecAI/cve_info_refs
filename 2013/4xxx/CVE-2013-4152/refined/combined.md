# CVE-2013-4152 XML External Entity (XXE) injection in Spring Framework

---

*From*: Pivotal Security Team <security () gopivotal com>

*Date*: Thu, 22 Aug 2013 08:06:33 -0700 (PDT)

---

```
Severity: Important

Vendor: Spring by Pivotal

Versions Affected:
- 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 (Spring OXM & Spring MVC)
- 4.0.0.M1 (Spring OXM)
- 4.0.0.M1-4.0.0.M2 (Spring MVC)
- Earlier unsupported versions may also be affected

Description:
The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller.
There are four possible source implementations passed to the unmarshaller:
- DOMSource
- StAXSource
- SAXSource
- StreamSource
For a DOMSource, the XML has already been parsed by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE.
For a StAXSource, the XMLStreamReader has already been created by user code and that code is responsible for protecting
against XXE.
For SAXSource and StreamSource instances, Spring processed external entities by default thereby creating this
vulnerability.
The issue was resolved by disabling external entity processing by default and adding an option to enable it for those
users that need to use this feature when processing XML from a trusted source.

It was also identified that Spring MVC processed user provided XML with JAXB in combination with a StAX XMLInputFactory
without disabling external entity resolution. External entity resolution has been disabled in this case.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:
- Users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.4 or later
- Users of 4.x should upgrade to 4.0.0.RC1 or later once released
Note the Spring OXM issue is fixed in 4.0.0.M2

Credit:
These issues were identified by Alvaro Munoz of the HP Enterprise Security Team.

# RHSA-2014:0212 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 roll up patch 4, which fixes two security
issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process
automation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform allows IT to leverage
existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future (EDA and
CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business process
execution speed and quality.

This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss SOA
Platform 5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security
issues are also fixed with this release:

A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
XML signature via a specially-crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

It was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property
for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
application server. The patch for this flaw disables external entity
processing by default, and provides a configuration directive to re-enable
it. (CVE-2013-4152)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1001326#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-26 22:02:32 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that:  "The Apache Hadoop RPC protocol is intended to provide bidirectional authentication between clients and servers. However, a malicious server or network attacker can unilaterally disable these authentication checks. This allows for potential reduction in the configured quality of protection of the RPC traffic, and privilege escalation if authentication credentials are passed over RPC."  This flaw only affects users who have enabled Hadoop's kerberos security features.  This is corrected in upstream versions 0.23.9, 1.2.1, and 2.0.6-alpha.

## Synopsis

Important: activemq security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0245)

## Topic

An updated activemq package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Apache ActiveMQ provides a SOA infrastructure to connect processes across
heterogeneous systems.

A flaw was found in Apache Camel's parsing of the FILE\_NAME header.
A remote attacker able to submit messages to a Camel route, which would
write the provided message to a file, could provide expression language
(EL) expressions in the FILE\_NAME header, which would be evaluated on the
server. This could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context
of the Camel server process. (CVE-2013-4330)

It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

It was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property
for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
application server. The patch for this flaw disables external entity
processing by default, and provides a configuration directive to re-enable
it. (CVE-2013-4152)

The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
in /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
custom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these
native libraries with malicious versions during the window between when
HawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

The CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat
Product Security Team, and the CVE-2014-0003 issue was discovered by David
Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

All users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.0 are advised to upgrade to
this updated package, which corrects these issues.

# XXE Injection in Spring Framework

---

*From*: "MustLive" <mustlive () websecurity com ua>

*Date*: Sat, 2 Nov 2013 16:04:59 +0200

---

```

Hello!

```
I'll give you additional information concerning advisory XML External Entity
(XXE) Injection in Spring Framework
(<http://securityvulns.ru/docs29758.html>).
```

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

- 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 (Spring OXM & Spring MVC)
- 4.0.0.M1 (Spring OXM)
- 4.0.0.M1-4.0.0.M2 (Spring MVC)
- Earlier unsupported versions may also be affected

-------------------------
Affected vendors:
-------------------------

Spring by Pivotal.

----------
Details:
----------

```
The Spring OXM wrapper doesn't disable external entity resolution when using
the JAXB unmarshaller (SAXSource and StreamSource instances are vulnerable).
Also Spring MVC processes user provided XML with JAXB in combination with a
StAX XMLInputFactory without disabling external entity resolution.
```

```
Besides standard vectors of attacks with XXE Injection vulnerabilities (such
as local file inclusion), which are usually mentioned in advisories, XXE
Injection also allows to conduct attacks on other sites. And with using
DAVOSET (DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool) it's possible to
automate such attacks.
```

```
I wrote about such attacks in my 2012's article "Using XML External Entities
(XXE) for attacks on other sites"
(<http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2012-August/008481.html>)
and 2013's "Using XXE vulnerabilities for attacks on other sites"
(<http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-August/008887.html>).
As I described in my articles, XXE vulnerabilities can be used for
conducting CSRF and DoS attacks on other sites (and at using multiple web
sites it's possible to conduct DDoS attacks). And my tool DAVOSET can be
used for conducting such attacks via XXE vulnerabilities.
```

```
In October I released video demonstration of DAVOSET:
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKi35-f346I>
```

```
So all vulnerable web applications with affected versions of Spring
Framework can be used for attacks on other sites via XXE Injection.
```

Package        : libspring-java
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4152
Debian Bug     : 720902

Alvaro Munoz discovered a XML External Entity (XXE) injection in the
Spring Framework which can be used for conducting CSRF and DoS attacks
on other sites.

The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity
resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. There are four possible
source implementations passed to the unmarshaller:

DOMSource
StAXSource
SAXSource
StreamSource

For a DOMSource, the XML has already been parsed by user code
and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE.

For a StAXSource, the XMLStreamReader has already been created
by user code and that code is responsible for protecting
against XXE.

For SAXSource and StreamSource instances, Spring processed
external entities by default thereby creating this
vulnerability.

The issue was resolved by disabling external entity processing
by default and adding an option to enable it for those users
that need to use this feature when processing XML from a
trusted source.

It was also identified that Spring MVC processed user provided
XML with JAXB in combination with a StAX XMLInputFactory
without disabling external entity resolution. External entity
resolution has been disabled in this case.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.6.RELEASE-6+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.6.RELEASE-10.

We recommend that you upgrade your libspring-java packages.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# RHSA-2014:0400 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0, which fixes multiple security issues, several
bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Moderate security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat
JBoss Fuse 6.0.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
section, for a list of changes.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

Security fixes:

A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
XML signature via a specially crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

A flaw was found in the Apache Hadoop RPC protocol. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could possibly use this flaw to unilaterally disable bidirectional
authentication between a client and a server, forcing a downgrade to simple
(unidirectional) authentication. This flaw only affected users who have
enabled Hadoop's Kerberos security features. (CVE-2013-2192)

It was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property
for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
application server. (CVE-2013-4152)

It was discovered that the Apache Santuario XML Security for Java project
allowed Document Type Definitions (DTDs) to be processed when applying
Transforms even when secure validation was enabled. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system, causing a
denial of service. (CVE-2013-4517)

It was found that the Spring MVC SourceHttpMessageConverter enabled entity
resolution by default. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct XXE
attacks on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
application server. (CVE-2013-6429)

The Spring JavaScript escape method insufficiently escaped some characters.
Applications using this method to escape user-supplied content, which would
be rendered in HTML5 documents, could be exposed to cross-site scripting
(XSS) flaws. (CVE-2013-6430)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload
handled small-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a
multipart request, causing Apache Commons FileUpload to enter an infinite
loop when processing such an incoming request. (CVE-2014-0050)

It was found that fixes for the CVE-2013-4152 and CVE-2013-6429 XXE issues
in Spring were incomplete. Spring MVC processed user-provided XML and
neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable
them, possibly allowing a remote attacker to conduct XXE attacks.
(CVE-2014-0054)

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Spring Framework when
using Spring MVC. When the action was not specified in a Spring form, the
action field would be populated with the requested URI, allowing an
attacker to inject malicious content into the form. (CVE-2014-1904)

The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
in /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom
library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native
libraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI
writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way Apache Zookeeper stored
the password of an administrative user in the log files. A local user with
access to these log files could use the exposed sensitive information to
gain administrative access to an application using Apache Zookeeper.
(CVE-2014-0085)

The CVE-2013-6430 issue was discovered by Jon Passki of Coverity SRL and
Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team, the CVE-2013-2035
issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security
Team, and the CVE-2014-0085 issue was discovered by Graeme Colman of
Red Hat.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-22 21:52:38 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the Spring Framework suffered from several XML External Entity (XXE) flaws:  Versions Affected: - 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 (Spring OXM) - 3.2.0 to 3.2.3 (Spring MVC) - 4.0.0.M1 (Spring OXM) - 4.0.0.M1-4.0.0.M2 (Spring MVC) - Earlier unsupported versions may also be affected  Description: The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller.  There are four possible source implementations passed to the unmarshaller: - DOMSource - StAXSource - SAXSource - StreamSource For a DOMSource, the XML has already been parsed by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE. For a StAXSource, the XMLStreamReader has already been created by user code and that code is responsible for protecting  against XXE. For SAXSource and StreamSource instances, Spring processed external entities by default thereby creating this  vulnerability. The issue was resolved by disabling external entity processing by default and adding an option to enable it for those  users that need to use this feature when processing XML from a trusted source.  It was also identified that Spring MVC processed user provided XML with JAXB in combination with a StAX XMLInputFactory  without disabling external entity resolution. External entity resolution has been disabled in this case.   Mitigation: Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: - Users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.4 or later - Users of 4.x should upgrade to 4.0.0.RC1 or later once released Note the Spring OXM issue is fixed in 4.0.0.M2  [1] <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Aug/154>   External References:  <http://www.gopivotal.com/security/cve-2013-4152> <https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework/pull/317> <https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10806>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c4)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-02 16:32:55 UTC  ``` Further information on this was recently posted: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/14>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c5)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-23 22:04:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been split, MITRE has provided the following guidance on CVE names:  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2013-4152](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4152) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2013-4152](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4152) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4152> Assigned: 20130612 Reference: <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Aug/154> Reference: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/14> Reference: <http://www.gopivotal.com/security/cve-2013-4152> Reference: <https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/317/files> Reference: <https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10806>  The Spring OXM wrapper in Spring Framework before 3.2.4 and 4.0.0.M1, when using the JAXB marshaller, does not disable entity resolution, which allows context-dependent attackers to read arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks via an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference in a (1) DOMSource, (2) StAXSource, (3) SAXSource, or (4) StreamSource, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.    Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2013-7315](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7315) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2013-7315](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7315) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7315> Assigned: 20140123 Reference: <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Aug/154> Reference: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/14> Reference: <http://www.gopivotal.com/security/cve-2013-4152> Reference: <https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10806>  The Spring MVC in Spring Framework 3.2.x before 3.2.4 and 4.0.0.M1 through 4.0.0.M2 does not disable external entity resolution for the StAX XMLInputFactory, which allows context-dependent attackers to read arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks via crafted XML with JAXB, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue, and a different vulnerability than [CVE-2013-4152](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4152).

# CVE-2013-4152 XML eXternal Entity (XXE) injection in Spring Framework

HIGH | AUGUST 22, 2013 | CVE-2013-4152
# Description

The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. There are four possible source implementations passed to the unmarshaller: DOMSource, StAXSource, SAXSource and StreamSource.

For a DOMSource, the XML has already been parsed by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE.

For a StAXSource, the XMLStreamReader has already been created by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE.

For SAXSource and StreamSource instances, Spring processed external entities by default thereby creating this vulnerability.

The issue was resolved by disabling external entity processing by default and adding an option to enable it for those users that need to use this feature when processing XML from a trusted source.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* 3.0.0 to 3.2.3
* 4.0.0.M1
* Earlier unsupported versions may be affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:

* Users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.4 or later
* Users of 4.x should upgrade to 4.0.0.M2 or later

# Credit

These issues were identified by Alvaro Munoz of the HP Enterprise Security Team.

# References

* <https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework/pull/317>

# History

2013-Aug-22: Initial vulnerability report published.

* 2014-Jun-19: Updated to remove Spring MVC aspects which have been split off into CVE-2013-7315

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1011726#c0)  Chess Hazlett    2013-09-25 01:30:42 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Apache Camel's parsing of the FILE_NAME header. A remote attacker able to submit messages to a Camel route, which would write the provided message to a file, could provide expression language (EL) expressions in the FILE_NAME header, which would be evaluated on the server. This could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context of the Camel server process.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-22 21:52:38 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the Spring Framework suffered from several XML External Entity (XXE) flaws:  Versions Affected: - 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 (Spring OXM) - 3.2.0 to 3.2.3 (Spring MVC) - 4.0.0.M1 (Spring OXM) - 4.0.0.M1-4.0.0.M2 (Spring MVC) - Earlier unsupported versions may also be affected  Description: The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller.  There are four possible source implementations passed to the unmarshaller: - DOMSource - StAXSource - SAXSource - StreamSource For a DOMSource, the XML has already been parsed by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE. For a StAXSource, the XMLStreamReader has already been created by user code and that code is responsible for protecting  against XXE. For SAXSource and StreamSource instances, Spring processed external entities by default thereby creating this  vulnerability. The issue was resolved by disabling external entity processing by default and adding an option to enable it for those  users that need to use this feature when processing XML from a trusted source.  It was also identified that Spring MVC processed user provided XML with JAXB in combination with a StAX XMLInputFactory  without disabling external entity resolution. External entity resolution has been disabled in this case.   Mitigation: Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: - Users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.4 or later - Users of 4.x should upgrade to 4.0.0.RC1 or later once released Note the Spring OXM issue is fixed in 4.0.0.M2  [1] <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Aug/154>   External References:  <http://www.gopivotal.com/security/cve-2013-4152> <https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework/pull/317> <https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10806>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c4)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-02 16:32:55 UTC  ``` Further information on this was recently posted: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/14>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c5)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-23 22:04:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been split, MITRE has provided the following guidance on CVE names:  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2013-4152](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4152) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2013-4152](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4152) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4152> Assigned: 20130612 Reference: <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Aug/154> Reference: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/14> Reference: <http://www.gopivotal.com/security/cve-2013-4152> Reference: <https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/317/files> Reference: <https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10806>  The Spring OXM wrapper in Spring Framework before 3.2.4 and 4.0.0.M1, when using the JAXB marshaller, does not disable entity resolution, which allows context-dependent attackers to read arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks via an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference in a (1) DOMSource, (2) StAXSource, (3) SAXSource, or (4) StreamSource, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.    Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2013-7315](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7315) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2013-7315](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7315) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7315> Assigned: 20140123 Reference: <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Aug/154> Reference: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/14> Reference: <http://www.gopivotal.com/security/cve-2013-4152> Reference: <https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10806>  The Spring MVC in Spring Framework 3.2.x before 3.2.4 and 4.0.0.M1 through 4.0.0.M2 does not disable external entity resolution for the StAX XMLInputFactory, which allows context-dependent attackers to read arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks via crafted XML with JAXB, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue, and a different vulnerability than [CVE-2013-4152](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4152).  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT from [CVE-2013-4152](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4152) due to different affected versions.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-25 16:42:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1  Via RHSA-2014:0212 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0212.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-03 18:26:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEL 6 Version of OpenShift Enterprise 2.0  Via RHSA-2014:0245 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0245.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-05 19:05:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEL 6 Version of OpenShift Enterprise 1.2  Via RHSA-2014:0254 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0254.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-14 13:48:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss AM-Q 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2014:0401 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0401.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1000186#c12)  Chess Hazlett    2014-04-15 02:32:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2014:0400 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0400.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Important: activemq security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0254)

## Topic

An updated activemq package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.7.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Apache ActiveMQ provides a SOA infrastructure to connect processes across
heterogeneous systems.

A flaw was found in Apache Camel's parsing of the FILE\_NAME header.
A remote attacker able to submit messages to a Camel route, which would
write the provided message to a file, could provide expression language
(EL) expressions in the FILE\_NAME header, which would be evaluated on the
server. This could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context
of the Camel server process. (CVE-2013-4330)

It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

It was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property
for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
application server. The patch for this flaw disables external entity
processing by default, and provides a configuration directive to re-enable
it. (CVE-2013-4152)

The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
in /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
custom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these
native libraries with malicious versions during the window between when
HawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

The CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat
Product Security Team, and the CVE-2014-0003 issue was discovered by David
Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

All users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.7 are advised to upgrade to
this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution
