{
  "CVE-2013-4152": {
    "Description": "The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the application server.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Spring OXM wrapper did not have a property to disable entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. Spring MVC also processed user-provided XML with JAXB without disabling external entity resolution.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "XML External Entity (XXE) injection.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers could read arbitrary files on the application server, conduct CSRF attacks, and cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted XML document to a vulnerable application.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote attacker able to submit messages to a Camel route, or send crafted XML to an endpoint using JAXB. Access to a vulnerable web application or service is required."
