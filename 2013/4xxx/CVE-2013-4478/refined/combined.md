CVE-2013-4478 is for the issue specifically covered in
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Oct/att-272/whatsup.txt>

which is
<https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/commit/8b46cdbfc14e07ca07d403aa28b0e7bc1c544785>
(security: shellwords escape attachment file names to prevent remote
code execution).

I missed that they fixed a second issue:

<https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/commit/ca0302e0c716682d2de22e9136400c704cc93e42>
(security: prevent remote command injection in content_type)

Pleas use CVE-2013-4479 for this

Package        : sup-mail
Vulnerability  : command injection
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4478 CVE-2013-4479
Debian Bug     : 728232

joernchen of Phenoelit discovered two command injection flaws in Sup, a
console-based email client. An attacker might execute arbitrary command
if the user opens a maliciously crafted email.

CVE-2013-4478

    Sup wrongly handled the filename of attachments.

CVE-2013-4479

    Sup did not sanitize the content-type of attachments.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.11-2+nmu1+deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.1+git20120407.aaa852f-1+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sup-mail packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
