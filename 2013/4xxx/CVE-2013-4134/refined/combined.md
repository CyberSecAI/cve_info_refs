OpenAFS Security Advisory 2013-003
Topic: Brute force DES attack permits compromise of AFS cell
CVE-2013-4134
Issued:
Last Updated:
Affected: OpenAFS servers before 1.6.5 / 1.4.15
The small size of the DES key space permits an attacker to brute
force a cell's service key and then forge traffic from any user
within the cell. The key space search can be performed in under 1
day at a cost of around $100 using publicly available services.
SUMMARY
=======
OpenAFS uses Kerberos tickets to secure network traffic. For historical
reasons, it has only supported the DES encryption algorithm to encrypt
these tickets. The weakness of DES's 56 bit key space has long been
known, however it has recently become possible to use that weakness
to cheaply (around $100) and rapidly (approximately 23 hours) compromise
a service's long term key.
An attacker must first obtain a ticket for the cell. They may then use
a brute force attack to compromise the cell's private service key.
Once an attacker has gained access to the service key, they can use this
to impersonate any user within the cell, including the super user, giving
them access to all administrative capabilities as well as all user data.
Recovering the service key from a DES encrypted ticket is an issue
for any Kerberos service still using DES (and especially so for realms which
still have DES keys on their ticket granting ticket). The MIT Kerberos
Consortium is aware of this issue, and have produced a general guide
for sites wishing to migrate away from DES which is referenced below.
This vulnerability is a particular problem for OpenAFS because DES is the only
encryption algorithm supported in current releases.
IMPACT
======
An attacker may gain complete control over the targeted cell.
No publicly available exploits are currently known.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
All current releases of OpenAFS. This is all releases prior to 1.4.15, all
releases in the 1.6 series prior to 1.6.5 and all releases in the 1.7 series
prior to 1.7.26.
FIXES
=====
The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade to OpenAFS 1.6.5
or later. For those sites unable, or unwilling, to upgrade to the 1.6 series,
a final release in the 1.4 series, 1.4.15, is provided.
In addition to upgrading, some additional cell configuration is required. New
encryption types must be added to the afs@REALM or afs/cell@REALM principal in
the KDC, and extracted to a new file (rxkad.keytab) on each OpenAFS file or
database server. Links to more detailed upgrade documentation are given below.
For sites running with kaserver, there is no fix, since kaserver still
only supports single DES. Sites running kaserver must migrate to a
Kerberos 5 environment in addition to applying the fixes in this alert,
in order to fix this issue.
DETAILS
=======
These patches extend the rxkad security class with two modifications. The first,
rxkad-k5, adds support for non-DES service keys. The first modification is
sufficient to fix the immediate vulnerability. The software update must be
deployed on all OpenAFS database and file servers within a cell,
additional encryption types added to the cell's afs/cell@REALM or
afs@REALM principal, and extracted to the rxkad.keytab file on each server.
This modification requires that all OpenAFS servers are built with Kerberos
support, and that all server machines have Kerberos libraries installed.
With the first change applied, DES is still used for the Kerberos session key
shared between client and server and, as such, DES must still be enabled in
the realm's KDC.
In order to disable DES entirely a second change is required. This
modification, rxkad-kdf, permits the use of non-DES Kerberos session keys and
removes the dependency on DES in the KDC. Unfortunately, this modification
requires changes to the OpenAFS client software on every machine that
makes authenticated connections to the cell. Once DES support is removed in
the KDC, only updated clients will be able to connect.
Note that the client modifications to accommodate rxkad-kdf do not
require a restart of the OpenAFS client in order to take effect. The
modifications only affect the userspace tools used to acquire tokens.
To summarise: The immediate security issue may be resolved by a server upgrade and
configuration change. Sites who wish to turn off DES entirely in their KDCs must
also upgrade all of their clients.
FURTHER READING
===============
Detailed documentation about how to deploy these changes is available from
http://www.openafs.org/
The MIT Kerberos Consortium provides the following documentation on moving
other services away from DES:

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================
This issue was identified by Alex Chernyakhovsky, Christy Dennison,
Patrick Hurst and Peter Iannucci as part of the MIT Computer Systems Security
course.
These patches were developed by Derrick Brashear, Alexander Chernyakhovsky,
Andrew Deason, Chaskiel M Grundman and Benjamin Kaduk, with advice from
Mitch Berger, Adam Glasgall, Jeffrey Hutzelman, Tom Yu and Nickolai
Zeldovich.

Package        : openafs
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4134 CVE-2013-4135

OpenAFS, the implementation of the distributed filesystem AFS, has been
updated to no longer use DES for the encryption of tickets. Additional
migration steps are needed to fully set the update into effect. For more
information please see the upstream advisory:
<http://www.openafs.org/security/OPENAFS-SA-2013-003.txt>

In addition the 'encrypt' option to the 'vos' tool was fixed.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12.1+dfsg-4+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.1-3+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
