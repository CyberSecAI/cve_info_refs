{
  "CVE-2013-4222": {
    "description": "It was found that tokens issued to a tenant were not invalidated when that tenant was disabled in Keystone. This could allow users assigned to a disabled tenant to retain access to resources they should no longer be able to access.",
    "root_cause": "Keystone did not properly purge or invalidate tokens associated with a disabled tenant.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper token invalidation"
    ],
    "impact": "Users of a disabled tenant could retain access to cloud resources that they should no longer have access to, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with a valid token for a tenant, that is later disabled by an admin, can continue to access resources associated with the tenant.",
    "required_capabilities": "A valid token for a tenant. An administrator must then disable the tenant."
