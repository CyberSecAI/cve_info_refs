| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=995598#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-08-09 19:59:48 UTC  ``` ### Summary ### When a tenant is disabled in Keystone, tokens that have been issued to that tenant are not invalidated. This can result in users having access to your cloud after you have attempted to revoke them.  ### Affected Services / Software ### Keystone  ### Discussion ### It appears that Keystone does not purge the tokens given out to tenants when a tenant is disabled. In some scenarios this could be very important to cloud providers. Take the case where a cloud provider must a tenant's access because of some legal investigation. Even though the tenant is disabled it would be possible for them to terminate VMs / delete Swift files etc. - There are many other abuse-cases...  ### Recommended Actions ### How the tokens are stored depends on your cloud deployment. If you deploy using Memcache to back Keystone then flushing the cash when disabling a token would resolve this issue for you, at the cost of other token lookups which are no longer in the cash requiring Keystone interaction.  It is of course possible to script something to remove tokens from any backend DB or cache but there is no 'official' way to do this.  ### Contacts / References ### Proposed Fix : <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/39878/> This OSSN : [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1179955](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/%2Bbug/1179955) OpenStack Security ML : openstack-security at lists.openstack.org OpenStack Security Group : <https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg>  References: <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-security/2013-August/000263.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=995598#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-08-09 20:06:12 UTC  ```  Created openstack-keystone tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 995601](show_bug.cgi?id=995601 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4222 openstack-keystone: OpenStack: Keystone disabling a tenant does not disable a user token [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 995602](show_bug.cgi?id=995602 "CLOSED CANTFIX - CVE-2013-4222 openstack-keystone: OpenStack: Keystone disabling a tenant does not disable a user token [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=995598#c3)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-23 00:28:52 UTC  ``` openstack-keystone-2013.2-0.9.b3.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

# restarting memcached loses revoked token list

Bug #1182920 reported by

on 2013-05-22

### Bug Description

With the memcached backend to tokens, the revoked token list only lasts as long as the memcached server is up and running. Thus, if the Keystone server is restarted, all token revocations are dropped, and they will not show up in later token revocation list requests.

To reproduce:

0. Set up keystone using the memcached backend to tokens

1. Create a token and ensure that it can be used via auth\_token middleware

2. Revoke the token

3. fetch the revocation list and ensure that the token is listed

4. restart Keystone

5. fetch the revocation list and see that the token is not listed

6. wait until the token revocation list has timed out and reissue request to a different remote service, token will be processed as valid.

There are some mitigating factors. Just submitting the revoked token to the same service after keystone has restarted will not show the error if the service is using memcached to hold the revocation list. Restarting the memcache instance used by the remote server will dump the revocation list, and the problem will then appear.

I have not yet verified this problem, but it follows from memcache.

Keystone uses a local memcache instance. If it were to be set up to use a remote memcache service, it would take restarting memcache to trigger the problem, and not keystone.

This affects PKI tokens only. UUID tokens are not affected: restarting memcached will drop them all, and they will report as invalid tokens.

The KVS backend is affected as well.

That sounds like a vulnerability, but it seems to derive from the very concept of storing revocation lists on volatile storage... So is it a implementation issue or an architectural issue ? (can we fix it ?)

To make sure I got it right... this means that revocation lists are valid only as long as you don't restart storage on both middleware and keystone servers... and this affects PKI tokens with either memcache or KVS backends ?

Agree; I'm not sure what the solution to this would be, other than not using using volatile storage. Perhaps issuing guidance to use a much shorter default [token] expiration (current default is 86400 seconds) in combination with PKI tokens?

I think a security note is most appropriate.

There might be ways to mitigate in the future, such as running memcached on multiple machines to ensure redundancy should the Keystone server fail. In a clustered environment, it will only be an issue if all of the memcached machines shutdown.

Memcachedb might also be a potential way to mitigate.

<http://memcachedb.org/>

It might also be possible to record the revocation list upon update, and to read that value in on start up. It depend on how common revocation events are whether that will have a negative impact, but I suspect it would be negligible.

Restarting memcached loses revoked token list

----

### Summary ###

When a cloud is deployed using Memcache as a backend for Keystone tokens there is a security concern that restarting Memcached will loose the list of revoked tokens, potentially allowing bad tokens / users to access the system after they had been revoked.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Keystone, Memcache

### Discussion ###

There might be ways to mitigate in the future, such as running memcached on multiple machines to ensure redundancy should the Keystone server fail. In a clustered environment, it will only be an issue if all of the memcached machines shutdown.

Memcachedb might also be a potential way to mitigate. <http://memcachedb.org/>

NOTE: Some deployments may intentionally flush Memcached in response to [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1179955](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/%2Bbug/1179955) - please exercise caution when considering how to approach this problem.

### Recommended Actions ###

This is a fundamental problem with using in-memory ephemeral storage for security information. If your deployment has strong security requirements or a reliance on up-to-date revoked token information we suggest you consider using an on-disk DB such as MySQL / PostgreSQL or perhaps look into Memcachedb.

A new blueprint for addressing this issue has been registered: [https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/revocation-backend](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/%2Bspec/revocation-backend)

The plan is to split the token persistence driver from the revocation list to ensure the revocation list uses a stable-storage backend instead of the volatile memcached/kvs backends.

Memcachedb might also be a potential way to mitigate. http://memcachedb.org/
NOTE: Some deployments may intentionally flush Memcached in response to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1179955 - please exercise caution when considering how to approach this problem.
### Recommended Actions ###
This is a fundamental problem with using in-memory ephemeral storage for security information. If your deployment has strong security requirements or a reliance on up-to-date revoked token information we suggest you consider using an on-disk DB such as MySQL / PostgreSQL or perhaps look into Memcachedb.

With regards to using "memcached" backend, there isn't a whole lot we can do to prevent this. There are initiatives to remove the persistence of tokens completely (revocation events, and non-persistent tokens).

I don't see how Keystone can otherwise address a fundamental issue with the persistent store for tokens / revocation list.

I am marking this as Invalid as it is not something we directly can address. It would be possible (with the new dogpile system for KVS token backends) to leverage Redis or other storage systems that potentially have a disk-back to restore from when restarting the external service.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# RHSA-2013:1524 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-keystone security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1524)

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
Catalog, and Policy services.

It was found that tokens issued to a tenant were not invalidated when that
tenant was disabled in Keystone. This could allow users assigned to a
disabled tenant to retain access to resources they should no longer be able
to access. (CVE-2013-4222)

These updated packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2013.1.4,
which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1021641)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* WebOb 1.0 has been removed from the Red Hat Openstack 3.0 package

requirements; all packages now use WebOb 1.2.3. (BZ#1012694)

All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted
automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

### Bug Description

Using keystone/python-keystoneclient master as of today when disabling a tenant would not disable the users attached to the and would still have access.

I would not mind to fix it but I want to make sure first if this is something done by design or I am missing something.

Here is a transcript of my tests :

# Here is the list of my tenants all enabled and nice (devstack default)

chmouel@vm:~$ keystone tenant-list

the json reply when validating token says that the tenant is still enabled even if it's disabled :

Adding Keystone core devs to discuss.

There has been some bugs files already about disabling / deleting tenants and how that should propagate to tenant-related resources, so I'm not 100% sure that would constitute a vulnerability.

FYI: I have just figured out that my tokens were stored in mysql DB so clearing them (or using memcached tokens) would get the tokens properly invalided after update.

I still believe there is a bug that we need to delete the token belonging to the tenants when we update it in :

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/identity/controllers.py#L108>

like done for users :

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/identity/controllers.py#L220>

I think we can remove the security issue tag (but that's definitvely a bug) since this can be workarounded but I would like some feedback from keystone core devs first.

If the token is tenant scoped .. would make sense to disable token?

Title:

  Disabling a tenant would not disable a user token

Status in OpenStack Identity (Keystone):

  In Progress

Bug description:

  Using keystone/python-keystoneclient master as of today when disabling

  a tenant would not disable the users attached to the and would still

  have access.

I would not mind to fix it but I want to make sure first if this is

  something done by design or I am missing something.

Here is a transcript of my tests :

If the token is tenant scoped .. would make sense to disable token?

the json reply when validating token says that the tenant is still
enabled even if it's disabled :
u'tenant': {u'description': None, u'enabled': True, u'id':
u'b39f8b007abe472b93ebb5c7fdd80c98', u'name': u'demo'}}

Triple-checking the need for a public OSSA on this

Is there a way for the admin to disable all tokens already issued for a tenant he wants to disable ? Then I'd tend to consider this a poor feature with potential security consequences (requiring information) rather than a vulnerability.

There's no convenient way to revoke the correct subset of tokens through the API or through the backend itself (even the SQL driver doesn't index by tenant/project). Depending on the actual driver in use, I'd suggest a brute force solution to wipe \*all\* tokens:

SQL: delete from token;

memcache: Restart memcache

KVS: Restart keystone

It's always wise to tread lightly where authentication behavior and the principle of least surprise are concerned. I don't think this warrants an OSSA, but might benefit from an OSSG security note with recommendations for how deployers can work around this shortcoming in production (whether that's clearing all active tokens or something more targeted).

Yeah, we can cut an OSSN for this. I'm not a keystone expert though so I'd like some better guidance here before we write the note, who should I reach out to for more info?

Does this get fixed when PKI-Tokens are used more (They seem to either support ephemeral i.e short-life tokens and/or revocation)

[DRAFT]

Disabling a tenant does not disable a user token

----

### Summary ###

When a tenant is disabled in Keystone, tokens that have been issued to that tenant are not invalidated. This can result in users having access to your cloud after you have attempted to revoke them.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Keystone

### Discussion ###

It appears that Keystone does not purge the tokens given out to tenants when a tenant is disabled. In some scenarios this could be very important to cloud providers. Take the case where a cloud provider must a tenant's access because of some legal investigation. Even though the tenant is disabled it would be possible for them to terminate VMs / delete Swift files etc. - There are many other abuse-cases...

### Recommended Actions ###

How the tokens are stored depends on your cloud deployment. If you deploy using Memcache to back Keystone then flushing the cash when disabling a token would resolve this issue for you, at the cost of other token lookups which are no longer in the cash requiring Keystone interaction.

It is of course possible to script something to remove tokens from any backend DB or cache but there is no 'official' way to do this.

I suggest removing "It appears that " from the start of the discussion.

Also "Take the case where a cloud provider must a tenant's" should be "Take the case where a cloud provider must revoke a tenant's".

Also " - There are many other abuse-cases..." should be "There are many other abuse-cases."

### Summary ###

When a tenant is disabled in Keystone, tokens that have been issued to

that tenant are not invalidated. This can result in users having access

to your cloud after you have attempted to revoke them.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Keystone

### Discussion ###

It appears that Keystone does not purge the tokens given out to tenants

when a tenant is disabled. In some scenarios this could be very

important to cloud providers. Take the case where a cloud provider must

a tenant's access because of some legal investigation. Even though the

tenant is disabled it would be possible for them to terminate VMs /

delete Swift files etc. - There are many other abuse-cases...

### Recommended Actions ###

How the tokens are stored depends on your cloud deployment. If you

deploy using Memcache to back Keystone then flushing the cash when

disabling a token would resolve this issue for you, at the cost of other

token lookups which are no longer in the cash requiring Keystone

interaction.

It is of course possible to script something to remove tokens from any

backend DB or cache but there is no 'official' way to do this.

Rob -- did you issue this OSSN already? If not ..

May need to clarify Memcache without DB backend ( in "If you deploy using Memcache .." ), where flushing cache would resolve the issue. If there is a DB behind it, your next paragraph with DB script necessary to clean up.

And given Chmouel's fix has been committed .. please add

"Patch <https://review.openstack.org/39878> addresses the issue and will be part of the next official release of OpenStack/Keystone. "

### Bug Description

Using keystone/python-keystoneclient master as of today when disabling a tenant would not disable the users attached to the and would still have access.

I would not mind to fix it but I want to make sure first if this is something done by design or I am missing something.

Here is a transcript of my tests :

the json reply when validating token says that the tenant is still enabled even if it's disabled :

u'tenant': {u'description': None, u'enabled': True, u'id': u'b39f8b007abe472b93ebb5c7fdd80c98', u'name': u'demo'}}

Adding Keystone core devs to discuss.

There has been some bugs files already about disabling / deleting tenants and how that should propagate to tenant-related resources, so I'm not 100% sure that would constitute a vulnerability.

FYI: I have just figured out that my tokens were stored in mysql DB so clearing them (or using memcached tokens) would get the tokens properly invalided after update.

I still believe there is a bug that we need to delete the token belonging to the tenants when we update it in :

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/identity/controllers.py#L108>

like done for users :

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/identity/controllers.py#L220>

I think we can remove the security issue tag (but that's definitvely a bug) since this can be workarounded but I would like some feedback from keystone core devs first.

the json reply when validating token says that the tenant is still
enabled even if it's disabled :

Triple-checking the need for a public OSSA on this

Is there a way for the admin to disable all tokens already issued for a tenant he wants to disable ? Then I'd tend to consider this a poor feature with potential security consequences (requiring information) rather than a vulnerability.

There's no convenient way to revoke the correct subset of tokens through the API or through the backend itself (even the SQL driver doesn't index by tenant/project). Depending on the actual driver in use, I'd suggest a brute force solution to wipe \*all\* tokens:

SQL: delete from token;

memcache: Restart memcache

KVS: Restart keystone

It's always wise to tread lightly where authentication behavior and the principle of least surprise are concerned. I don't think this warrants an OSSA, but might benefit from an OSSG security note with recommendations for how deployers can work around this shortcoming in production (whether that's clearing all active tokens or something more targeted).

Yeah, we can cut an OSSN for this. I'm not a keystone expert though so I'd like some better guidance here before we write the note, who should I reach out to for more info?

Does this get fixed when PKI-Tokens are used more (They seem to either support ephemeral i.e short-life tokens and/or revocation)

[DRAFT]

Disabling a tenant does not disable a user token

----

### Summary ###

When a tenant is disabled in Keystone, tokens that have been issued to that tenant are not invalidated. This can result in users having access to your cloud after you have attempted to revoke them.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Keystone

### Discussion ###

It appears that Keystone does not purge the tokens given out to tenants when a tenant is disabled. In some scenarios this could be very important to cloud providers. Take the case where a cloud provider must a tenant's access because of some legal investigation. Even though the tenant is disabled it would be possible for them to terminate VMs / delete Swift files etc. - There are many other abuse-cases...

### Recommended Actions ###

How the tokens are stored depends on your cloud deployment. If you deploy using Memcache to back Keystone then flushing the cash when disabling a token would resolve this issue for you, at the cost of other token lookups which are no longer in the cash requiring Keystone interaction.

It is of course possible to script something to remove tokens from any backend DB or cache but there is no 'official' way to do this.

Also "Take the case where a cloud provider must a tenant's" should be "Take the case where a cloud provider must revoke a tenant's".

Looks like patch was merged into upstream master. Not certain whether it's been released anywhere.

Disabling a tenant does not disable a user token

----

### Summary ###

When a tenant is disabled in Keystone, tokens that have been issued to that tenant are not invalidated. This can result in users having access to your cloud after you have attempted to revoke them.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Keystone

### Discussion ###

Keystone does not purge the tokens given out to tenants when a tenant is disabled. In some scenarios this could be very important to cloud providers. Take the case where a cloud provider must a revoke tenant's access because of some legal investigation. Even though the tenant is disabled it would be possible for them to terminate VMs / delete Swift files etc. There are many other abuse-cases.

### Recommended Actions ###

How the tokens are stored depends on your cloud deployment. If you deploy using Memcache to back Keystone then flushing the cash when disabling a token would resolve this issue for you, at the cost of other token lookups which are no longer in the cash requiring Keystone interaction.

It is of course possible to script something to remove tokens from any backend DB or cache but there is no 'official' way to do this.

NOTE: Flushing memcache can result in loosing token revocation information as addressed in [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1182920](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/%2Bbug/1182920)

Rob -- did you issue this OSSN already? If not ..

May need to clarify Memcache without DB backend ( in "If you deploy using Memcache .." ), where flushing cache would resolve the issue. If there is a DB behind it, your next paragraph with DB script necessary to clean up.

And given Chmouel's fix has been committed .. please add

"Patch <https://review.openstack.org/39878> addresses the issue and will be part of the next official release of OpenStack/Keystone. "

Malini

I should revise my own comment #22 as it's not very clear. What I meant to say was:

> While this has been addressed for havana, we will \*likely\* be taking a new approach to revocation during icehouse

ok, it is a grizzly issue. Also, upstream is 50/50 on whether or not they will backport.

# USN-2002-1: Keystone vulnerabilities

23 October 2013

Keystone would improperly grant access to invalid tokens under certain
circumstances.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [keystone](/security/cves?package=keystone) - OpenStack identity service

## Details

Chmouel Boudjnah discovered that Keystone did not properly invalidate user

tokens when a tenant was disabled which allowed an authenticated user to

retain access via the token. ([CVE-2013-4222](/security/CVE-2013-4222))

Kieran Spear discovered that Keystone did not properly verify PKI tokens

when performing revocation when using the memcache and KVS backends. An

authenticated attacker could exploit this to bypass intended access

restrictions. ([CVE-2013-4294](/security/CVE-2013-4294))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [python-keystone](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone)
  -
  [1:2013.1.3-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone/1%3A2013.1.3-0ubuntu1.1)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Overview:

The OpenStack Security SIG actively works to improve OpenStack security through improvements to code, architecture and various documentation efforts including vulnerability management (through the Vulnerability Management Team) and issuing of Security Notes.

The primary focus points for the security team are:

(1) Securing the OpenStack code base

(2) Providing deployers with the documentation needed to make sound security choices when deploying or consuming OpenStack

(3) Helping address security needs in a cross project collaborative way.

Author and maintain the OpenStack Security Guide:

\* <http://docs.openstack.org/sec/>

The security team conducts all non-confidential business on the openstack-sig mailing list with the [Security] tag.

\* Subscribe: <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-sigs>

We previously used the openstack-security mailing list

\* Archive: <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-sigs/>

Advisory Activities:

\* Act as a consultancy group for OpenStack developers

\* The Vulnerability Management Team (VMT) exists as a subset of the Security SIG

\* VMT confidentially handles vulnerability disclosures

\* The wider security SIG can confirm vulnerability severity at the request of the VMT

Security Guidance:

\* OpenStack Security Notes provide Security Guidance on OpenStack Configuration and Usage: <https://launchpad.net/ossn/>

\* Issued Security Notes: <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security_Notes>

Research Activities:

\* Exploits / Proofs of Concept

\* Vulnerability Research

\* Threat Verification

\* Hardening

\* Security Architecture

\* Secure OpenStack Provisioning

\* Documenting Security Features

\* Configuration Management

\* Site Survey Functionality / Security Dashboard

\* More

Membership:

In April 2015 the Security SIG became an official part of OpenStack. Previously the security team was comprised of two separate organisations; the VMT and the OSSG. The VMT was a small team handling critical vulnerability reports and remediation whereas the OSSG formed the bulk of the remaining security activities within OpenStack. In early 2015 these teams merged, this was quickly followed by the Security team being accepted into OpenStack.

History of the OSSG:

Originally instigated in 2012 by HP and Nebula, the OSSG initially sought to work on an invite only basis, seeking to draw in contributors from large OpenStack teams such as Rackspace, Ubuntu and Red Hat. The team has grown significantly in size and function and now works on a moderated list model, we're open to contributors of all types and the list is moderated simply to keep out spammers.

In early 2018 what was the Security Project became the Security SIG

Security GIG Code of Ethics:

Members of the security team agree that the goals of the group are to improve the security of OpenStack. Information made available to the security team may at times be sensitive and should always be treated as confidential, not to be shared outside of the group. Members are expressly prohibited from profiting by sharing vulnerability or exploit information obtained from the security team with a third party. All group members agree to abide by industry best practices in responsible disclosure, including providing proper attribution for any technical contributions.

Leadership:

The security SIG has no formal leadership, instead it has chairs, with the current chairs being Luke Hinds (Red Hat) and Gage Hugo (AT&T).

Leadership Functions:

\* Formal liaison with OpenStack teams

\* Security team co-ordination

\* Driving Security Awareness

\* Providing Suggestions for Research Direction

\* More

Ongoing Tasks for the Security SIG:

\* Recruiting security talent

\* Evangelizing security within the community

\* Document current best practices - useful as a documentation exercise and for understanding next steps. (e.g., if best practices involve strongly isolating a particular component b/c it is riddled with security issues, then that will help reveal where we should be working)

\* Develop stress tests that can be integrated with current testing
