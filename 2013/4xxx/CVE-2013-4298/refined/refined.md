Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-4298:

*   **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow (memory corruption)
*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of comments in GIF images within the `ReadGIFImage` function in `coders/gif.c`. Specifically, the code allocated memory for comments but did not properly ensure null termination, leading to out-of-bounds write. Raw memory handling functions were used instead of `ConcatenateString`.
*   **Affected Versions:** ImageMagick versions before 6.7.8-8.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (application crash due to memory corruption).
    *   Potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   A remote attacker can cause the vulnerability by crafting a malicious GIF image with a specially crafted comment.
    *   The user or an automated system is tricked into opening the crafted GIF image using ImageMagick.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to create or modify GIF images.
    *   Ability to deliver the crafted GIF image to a target user or system that processes it with ImageMagick.
*   **Affected Systems:** Systems using ImageMagick to process GIF images.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed by properly handling comments in `coders/gif.c`, specifically by ensuring correct memory allocation and null termination. The fix involved replacing raw memory handling functions with `ConcatenateString`.
*   **Debian:** The issue was assigned Debian bug 721273 and was fixed in several versions including `8:6.6.0.4-3+squeeze3`, `8:6.7.7.10-5+deb7u2`, and `8:6.7.7.10-6`.
*   **Ubuntu:** Fixed in `8:6.7.7.10-2ubuntu4.1` (Quantal) and `8:6.7.7.10-5ubuntu3` (Saucy).
*   **Unaffected Systems:** Debian Squeeze is listed as not affected because the code was not vulnerable.
