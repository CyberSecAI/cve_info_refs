# Glance allows user to create images and add other tenants as members (CVE-2013-4354)

Bug #1226078 reported by

on 2013-09-16

### Bug Description

It's well known that Glance does not perform any check on tenants. This has been a behavior we kept as-is to avoid increasing requests needed in the image management process, however, after some tests, I think this behavior can be a security issue.

Scenario:

- Create an image using user1

- Pick tenant's id of user2 and add it as a member of the image user1 just created

- Use user2 to list images. This will list the image user1 created.

I think this is an issue because it allows user from other tenants to sneak images with a backdoor to other tenants.

I assume this behavior has been exploitable back at least as far as essex? When you say well-known, is the choice not to check tenant membership on these operations publically documented (not just buried in the source code or hinted at in mailing list archives)? Are there scenarios where this could reasonably compromise tenant security or is it simply a means of bypassing resource limits/restrictions? I'm basically trying to work out whether this warrants an advisory, and if so what risks it presents to whom.

Following an E-mail discussion with Flavio and Kurt from Red Hat, I'm making this bug public to expedite broader discussion and mitigation. Also, per Kurt, this affects at least Folsom, Grizzly and presumably Havana (no word yet on whether it extends back as far as Essex).

The trick here is that "fixing" this would significantly alter the behavior of Glance by preventing something that was always supported so far (and could be used for good reasons)... We could document the risk and address it in future API releases, but that would not address the "vulnerability". Thoughts ?

I think this bug has been well understood for some time.

We however could not \*fix\* it without breaking backwards compatibility in v1. Hence, we held off on memberships in v2.0, and then only added them in v2.1 when we were sure that we could prevent this kind of griefing/spamming.

In v2.1+, when you add a tenant id as a member to an image, the membership starts out in the "pending" state. "Pending" memberships can be viewed by users in that tenant by querying specifically for "membership-status=pending", however, they must be "accepted" before they show up in the default listing. This puts in place a two step solution that IMO generally resolves the security issue.

In addition, it is possible for deployers to limit image sharing to specific roles, in case more control is required.

So I'm not sure if this bug is "invalid", "fix released", or "wontfix" at this point.

It is true that this issue was fixed in v2.1 but it still exists in previous versions of the API. I agree on the fact that this behavior has been well understood for some time but I'm not sure people is aware of this vulnerability, though.

I agree with Thierry's idea of documenting the vulnerability somewhere without changing the way Glance works. I also prefer to keep Glance the way it is today, if we all agree that documenting this is enough to close this bug.

Thank you all!

This is what OSSNs (security notes) have been designed to solve -- informing the public of security best practices around OpenStack, when patching the code does not fully address all concerns.

My suggestion would be for an OSSN to mention the potential image sneaking in previous versions, and to encourage people to run havana glance with enable\_v1\_api=False if they can ?

Glance allows sharing of images between projects without consumer project approval

---

### Summary ###

Glance allows images to be shared between projects. In certain API versions, images can be shared without the consumer project's approval. This allows potentially malicious images to show up in a project's image list.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Glance, Image Service, Diablo, Essex, Folsom, Grizzly, Havana

### Discussion ###

Since the OpenStack Diablo release, Glance allows images to be shared between projects. To share an image, the producer of the image adds the consumer project as a member of the image. When using the Image Service API v2.0 and earlier, the image producer is able to share an image with a consumer project without their approval. This results in the shared image showing up in the image list for the consumer project. This can mislead users with roles in the consumer project into running a potentially malicious image.

The Image Service API v2.1 makes image sharing a two-step process. An image producer must add a consumer as a member of the image, and the consumer must accept the shared image before it shows up in their image list. This additional approval process allows a consumer to control what images show up in their image list, thus preventing potentially malicious images being used without the consumers knowledge

### Recommended Actions ###

In the OpenStack Diablo, Essex, and Folsom releases, Glance supports image sharing using the Image Service API v2.0 or earlier. There is no way to require approval of a shared image by consumer projects. Users should be cautioned to be careful when using images from their image list, as they may be using an image that was shared with them without their knowledge.

In the OpenStack Grizzly and Havana releases, Glance supports the Image Service API v2.1 or later. Support is still provided for Image Service API v1, which allows image sharing between projects without consumer project approval. It is recommended to disable v1 of the Image Service API if possible. This can be done by setting the following directive in the glance-api.conf configuration file:

---- begin example glance-api.conf snippet ----

enable\_v1\_api = False

---- end example glance-api.conf snippet ----

This looks very good. I do, however, have one correction I would like to submit. In v2.0 of the images api, we simply did not include image sharing--so the vulnerability does not exist there. It is only part of the v1 series.

I think it would be nice to mention that this is a non-issue in 2.0 b/c image sharing isn't available. Otherwise, people reading this may see v1 and v2.1 and not know what to do with v2.0.

This looks good, but I do agree with Bryan's suggestion. I suspect it could be added as a small clarification to the second paragraph of the discussion section (which looks to need a trailing period as well.)

Glance allows images to be shared between projects. In certain API versions, images can be shared without the consumer project's approval. This allows potentially malicious images to show up in a project's image list.
### Affected Services / Software ###
Glance, Image Service, Diablo, Essex, Folsom, Grizzly, Havana
### Discussion ###
Since the OpenStack Diablo release, Glance allows images to be shared between projects. To share an image, the producer of the image adds the consumer project as a member of the image. When using the Image Service API v1, the image producer is able to share an image with a consumer project without their approval. This results in the shared image showing up in the image list for the consumer project. This can mislead users with roles in the consumer project into running a potentially malicious image.
The Image Service API v2.0 does not allow image sharing between projects, so a project is not susceptible to running unauthorized images shared by other projects. The Image Service API v2.1 allows image sharing using a two-step process. An image producer must add a consumer as a member of the image, and the consumer must accept the shared image before it shows up in their image list. This additional approval process allows a consumer to control what images show up in their image list, thus preventing potentially malicious images being used without the consumers knowledge.
### Recommended Actions ###
In the OpenStack Diablo, Essex, and Folsom releases, Glance supports image sharing using the Image Service API v1. There is no way to require approval of a shared image by consumer projects. Users should be cautioned to be careful when using images from their image list, as they may be using an image that was shared with them without their knowledge.
In the OpenStack Grizzly and Havana releases, Glance supports the Image Service API v2.1 or later. Support is still provided for Image Service API v1, which allows image sharing between projects without consumer project approval. It is recommended to disable v1 of the Image Service API if possible. This can be done by setting the following directive in the glance-api.conf configuration file:
---- begin example glance-api.conf snippet ----
enable\_v1\_api = False
---- end example glance-api.conf snippet ----

# Glance allows user to create images and add other tenants as members (CVE-2013-4354)

Bug #1226078 reported by
[Flavio Percoco](https://launchpad.net/~flaper87)
on 2013-09-16

### Bug Description

It's well known that Glance does not perform any check on tenants. This has been a behavior we kept as-is to avoid increasing requests needed in the image management process, however, after some tests, I think this behavior can be a security issue.

Scenario:

- Create an image using user1

- Pick tenant's id of user2 and add it as a member of the image user1 just created

- Use user2 to list images. This will list the image user1 created.

I think this is an issue because it allows user from other tenants to sneak images with a backdoor to other tenants.

I assume this behavior has been exploitable back at least as far as essex? When you say well-known, is the choice not to check tenant membership on these operations publically documented (not just buried in the source code or hinted at in mailing list archives)? Are there scenarios where this could reasonably compromise tenant security or is it simply a means of bypassing resource limits/restrictions? I'm basically trying to work out whether this warrants an advisory, and if so what risks it presents to whom.

Following an E-mail discussion with Flavio and Kurt from Red Hat, I'm making this bug public to expedite broader discussion and mitigation. Also, per Kurt, this affects at least Folsom, Grizzly and presumably Havana (no word yet on whether it extends back as far as Essex).

The trick here is that "fixing" this would significantly alter the behavior of Glance by preventing something that was always supported so far (and could be used for good reasons)... We could document the risk and address it in future API releases, but that would not address the "vulnerability". Thoughts ?

I think this bug has been well understood for some time.

We however could not \*fix\* it without breaking backwards compatibility in v1. Hence, we held off on memberships in v2.0, and then only added them in v2.1 when we were sure that we could prevent this kind of griefing/spamming.

In v2.1+, when you add a tenant id as a member to an image, the membership starts out in the "pending" state. "Pending" memberships can be viewed by users in that tenant by querying specifically for "membership-status=pending", however, they must be "accepted" before they show up in the default listing. This puts in place a two step solution that IMO generally resolves the security issue.

In addition, it is possible for deployers to limit image sharing to specific roles, in case more control is required.

So I'm not sure if this bug is "invalid", "fix released", or "wontfix" at this point.

It is true that this issue was fixed in v2.1 but it still exists in previous versions of the API. I agree on the fact that this behavior has been well understood for some time but I'm not sure people is aware of this vulnerability, though.

I agree with Thierry's idea of documenting the vulnerability somewhere without changing the way Glance works. I also prefer to keep Glance the way it is today, if we all agree that documenting this is enough to close this bug.

Thank you all!

This is what OSSNs (security notes) have been designed to solve -- informing the public of security best practices around OpenStack, when patching the code does not fully address all concerns.

My suggestion would be for an OSSN to mention the potential image sneaking in previous versions, and to encourage people to run havana glance with enable\_v1\_api=False if they can ?

This looks very good. I do, however, have one correction I would like to submit. In v2.0 of the images api, we simply did not include image sharing--so the vulnerability does not exist there. It is only part of the v1 series.

I think it would be nice to mention that this is a non-issue in 2.0 b/c image sharing isn't available. Otherwise, people reading this may see v1 and v2.1 and not know what to do with v2.0.

This looks good, but I do agree with Bryan's suggestion. I suspect it could be added as a small clarification to the second paragraph of the discussion section (which looks to need a trailing period as well.)

Glance allows sharing of images between projects without consumer project approval

---

### Summary ###

Glance allows images to be shared between projects. In certain API versions, images can be shared without the consumer project's approval. This allows potentially malicious images to show up in a project's image list.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Glance, Image Service, Diablo, Essex, Folsom, Grizzly, Havana

### Discussion ###

Since the OpenStack Diablo release, Glance allows images to be shared between projects. To share an image, the producer of the image adds the consumer project as a member of the image. When using the Image Service API v1, the image producer is able to share an image with a consumer project without their approval. This results in the shared image showing up in the image list for the consumer project. This can mislead users with roles in the consumer project into running a potentially malicious image.

The Image Service API v2.0 does not allow image sharing between projects, so a project is not susceptible to running unauthorized images shared by other projects. The Image Service API v2.1 allows image sharing using a two-step process. An image producer must add a consumer as a member of the image, and the consumer must accept the shared image before it shows up in their image list. This additional approval process allows a consumer to control what images show up in their image list, thus preventing potentially malicious images being used without the consumers knowledge.

### Recommended Actions ###

In the OpenStack Diablo, Essex, and Folsom releases, Glance supports image sharing using the Image Service API v1. There is no way to require approval of a shared image by consumer projects. Users should be cautioned to be careful when using images from their image list, as they may be using an image that was shared with them without their knowledge.

In the OpenStack Grizzly and Havana releases, Glance supports the Image Service API v2.1 or later. Support is still provided for Image Service API v1, which allows image sharing between projects without consumer project approval. It is recommended to disable v1 of the Image Service API if possible. This can be done by setting the following directive in the glance-api.conf configuration file:

---- begin example glance-api.conf snippet ----

enable\_v1\_api = False

---- end example glance-api.conf snippet ----

# Glance allows user to create images and add other tenants as members (CVE-2013-4354)

Bug #1226078 reported by
[Flavio Percoco](https://launchpad.net/~flaper87)
on 2013-09-16

[10](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

### Bug Description

It's well known that Glance does not perform any check on tenants. This has been a behavior we kept as-is to avoid increasing requests needed in the image management process, however, after some tests, I think this behavior can be a security issue.

Scenario:

- Create an image using user1

- Pick tenant's id of user2 and add it as a member of the image user1 just created

- Use user2 to list images. This will list the image user1 created.

I think this is an issue because it allows user from other tenants to sneak images with a backdoor to other tenants.

I assume this behavior has been exploitable back at least as far as essex? When you say well-known, is the choice not to check tenant membership on these operations publically documented (not just buried in the source code or hinted at in mailing list archives)? Are there scenarios where this could reasonably compromise tenant security or is it simply a means of bypassing resource limits/restrictions? I'm basically trying to work out whether this warrants an advisory, and if so what risks it presents to whom.

Following an E-mail discussion with Flavio and Kurt from Red Hat, I'm making this bug public to expedite broader discussion and mitigation. Also, per Kurt, this affects at least Folsom, Grizzly and presumably Havana (no word yet on whether it extends back as far as Essex).

The trick here is that "fixing" this would significantly alter the behavior of Glance by preventing something that was always supported so far (and could be used for good reasons)... We could document the risk and address it in future API releases, but that would not address the "vulnerability". Thoughts ?

I think this bug has been well understood for some time.

We however could not \*fix\* it without breaking backwards compatibility in v1. Hence, we held off on memberships in v2.0, and then only added them in v2.1 when we were sure that we could prevent this kind of griefing/spamming.

In v2.1+, when you add a tenant id as a member to an image, the membership starts out in the "pending" state. "Pending" memberships can be viewed by users in that tenant by querying specifically for "membership-status=pending", however, they must be "accepted" before they show up in the default listing. This puts in place a two step solution that IMO generally resolves the security issue.

In addition, it is possible for deployers to limit image sharing to specific roles, in case more control is required.

So I'm not sure if this bug is "invalid", "fix released", or "wontfix" at this point.

It is true that this issue was fixed in v2.1 but it still exists in previous versions of the API. I agree on the fact that this behavior has been well understood for some time but I'm not sure people is aware of this vulnerability, though.

I agree with Thierry's idea of documenting the vulnerability somewhere without changing the way Glance works. I also prefer to keep Glance the way it is today, if we all agree that documenting this is enough to close this bug.

Thank you all!

This is what OSSNs (security notes) have been designed to solve -- informing the public of security best practices around OpenStack, when patching the code does not fully address all concerns.

My suggestion would be for an OSSN to mention the potential image sneaking in previous versions, and to encourage people to run havana glance with enable\_v1\_api=False if they can ?

This looks very good. I do, however, have one correction I would like to submit. In v2.0 of the images api, we simply did not include image sharing--so the vulnerability does not exist there. It is only part of the v1 series.

I'd like to see Mark's comment addressed. Otherwise, this looks good to me.

Thanks for the feedback Mark! Here is an updated draft that corrects the issue you pointed out. If this looks good to you and Bryan, I'll get it sent out.

Glance allows sharing of images between projects without consumer project approval

---

### Summary ###

Glance allows images to be shared between projects. In certain API versions, images can be shared without the consumer project's approval. This allows potentially malicious images to show up in a project's image list.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Glance, Image Service, Diablo, Essex, Folsom, Grizzly, Havana

### Discussion ###

Since the OpenStack Diablo release, Glance allows images to be shared between projects. To share an image, the producer of the image adds the consumer project as a member of the image. When using the Image Service API v1, the image producer is able to share an image with a consumer project without their approval. This results in the shared image showing up in the image list for the consumer project. This can mislead users with roles in the consumer project into running a potentially malicious image.

The Image Service API v2.1 makes image sharing a two-step process. An image producer must add a consumer as a member of the image, and the consumer must accept the shared image before it shows up in their image list. This additional approval process allows a consumer to control what images show up in their image list, thus preventing potentially malicious images being used without the consumers knowledge

### Recommended Actions ###

In the OpenStack Diablo, Essex, and Folsom releases, Glance supports image sharing using the Image Service API v1. There is no way to require approval of a shared image by consumer projects. Users should be cautioned to be careful when using images from their image list, as they may be using an image that was shared with them without their knowledge.

In the OpenStack Grizzly and Havana releases, Glance supports the Image Service API v2.1 or later. Support is still provided for Image Service API v1, which allows image sharing between projects without consumer project approval. It is recommended to disable v1 of the Image Service API if possible. This can be done by setting the following directive in the glance-api.conf configuration file:

---- begin example glance-api.conf snippet ----

enable\_v1\_api = False

---- end example glance-api.conf snippet ----

I think it would be nice to mention that this is a non-issue in 2.0 b/c image sharing isn't available. Otherwise, people reading this may see v1 and v2.1 and not know what to do with v2.0.

This looks good, but I do agree with Bryan's suggestion. I suspect it could be added as a small clarification to the second paragraph of the discussion section (which looks to need a trailing period as well.)

This adds a clarification about API v2.0 to the second paragraph of the discussion section. It also corrects the missing period at the end of that paragraph.

Subject: OpenStack: Glance image creation in other tenant accounts (CVE-2013-4354)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

With apologies, I was supposed to send this out yesterday but missed
it. I spoke with upstream and we agreed that making this public does
not present a major risk.

- From <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-4354>

==========
Dafna Ron of Red Hat reports:

Description of problem:

when I try to create an image with tenant name and not tenant ID, the
image is not created and no errors are issued.
you simply cannot find the image.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

openstack-glance-2013.1.3-1.el6ost.noarch

How reproducible:

100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install AIO with local tgt storage (using packstack)
2. create a tenant and a user
3. create an image for the tenant using the tenant name
4. run glance image-list while logging in with user
5. run the same create command using tenant ID
6. run glance image-list while logging in with the user

Actual results:

image is no created with tenant name.
no errors or indicators that the image was not created.

Expected results:

image should be created with tenant name
if we decided not to allow create of image with tenant name we should
block the command from running with missing param error

========

Upon further investigation Flavio Percoco of Red Hat reports:

Ayal suggested this could also be a security issue. I went ahead and
tested current behavior and indeed, this behavior could be used to
inject images to other users.

Scenario:
- - Create an image using user1
- - Pick tenant's id of user2 and add it as a member of the image user1
just created
- - Use user2 to list images. This will list the image user1 created.

I think this is an issue because it allows user from other tenants to
sneak images with a backdoor to other tenants.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1008615#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-09-16 17:16:30 UTC  ```  Dafna Ron of Red Hat reports:  Description of problem:  when I try to create an image with tenant name and not tenant ID, the image is not created and no errors are issued.  you simply cannot find the image.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  openstack-glance-2013.1.3-1.el6ost.noarch  How reproducible:  100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. install AIO with local tgt storage (using packstack) 2. create a tenant and a user  3. create an image for the tenant using the tenant name 4. run glance image-list while logging in with user  5. run the same create command using tenant ID 6. run glance image-list while logging in with the user  Actual results:  image is no created with tenant name.  no errors or indicators that the image was not created.   Expected results:  image should be created with tenant name if we decided not to allow create of image with tenant name we should block the command from running with missing param error   ========  Upon further investigation Flavio Percoco of Red Hat reports:  Ayal suggested this could also be a security issue. I went ahead and tested current behavior and indeed, this behavior could be used to inject images to other users.  Scenario: - Create an image using user1 - Pick tenant's id of user2 and add it as a member of the image user1 just created - Use user2 to list images. This will list the image user1 created.  I think this is an issue because it allows user from other tenants to sneak images with a backdoor to other tenants.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1008615#c2)  Lon Hohberger    2013-10-07 17:51:08 UTC  ``` This was discussed upstream.  The analysis seems to be:  * this is actually a feature which has been present since the Glance version 1.0 API  * retroactively fixing this would break previous expected behavior which has beneficial uses  * this has been resolved in the version 2.1 API via a two-step process: a user can create an image for another tenant, which then goes in to a 'pending state' and must be accepted by the other tenant in order to be used.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1008615#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-10-07 20:31:56 UTC  ``` The risks associated with fixing this bug in OpenStack 3.0 are greater than its security impact as it would require default behavior to be changed. A future release of OpenStack may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1008615#c4)  Flavio Percoco    2013-11-22 17:07:42 UTC  ``` As Lon mentioned, this was discussed upstream and a OSSN[0] was recently released.  I propose closing this bug as 'won't fix' based on the points raised by Lon, since this is not present in API v2 and will be fully supported by the client as part of Icehouse - RHOS 5.0.  [0]  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1226078/comments/11](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/%2Bbug/1226078/comments/11)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1008615#c5)  Perry Myers    2013-12-03 18:19:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to Flavio Percoco from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1008615#c4)) > I propose closing this bug as 'won't fix' based on the points raised by Lon, > since this is not present in API v2 and will be fully supported by the > client as part of Icehouse - RHOS 5.0.  Kurt, any objections to fpercoco's plan here?   ``` |  |

## [“OpenStack Security SIG” team](https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg)

* Overview
* [Code](https://code.launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg)
* [Bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg)
* [Blueprints](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg)
* [Translations](https://translations.launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg)
* [Answers](https://answers.launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg)

Overview:

The OpenStack Security SIG actively works to improve OpenStack security through improvements to code, architecture and various documentation efforts including vulnerability management (through the Vulnerability Management Team) and issuing of Security Notes.

The primary focus points for the security team are:

(1) Securing the OpenStack code base

(2) Providing deployers with the documentation needed to make sound security choices when deploying or consuming OpenStack

(3) Helping address security needs in a cross project collaborative way.

Author and maintain the OpenStack Security Guide:

\* <http://docs.openstack.org/sec/>

The security team conducts all non-confidential business on the openstack-sig mailing list with the [Security] tag.

\* Subscribe: <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-sigs>

We previously used the openstack-security mailing list

\* Archive: <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-sigs/>

Advisory Activities:

\* Act as a consultancy group for OpenStack developers

\* The Vulnerability Management Team (VMT) exists as a subset of the Security SIG

\* VMT confidentially handles vulnerability disclosures

\* The wider security SIG can confirm vulnerability severity at the request of the VMT

Security Guidance:

\* OpenStack Security Notes provide Security Guidance on OpenStack Configuration and Usage: <https://launchpad.net/ossn/>

\* Issued Security Notes: <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security_Notes>

Research Activities:

\* Exploits / Proofs of Concept

\* Vulnerability Research

\* Threat Verification

\* Hardening

\* Security Architecture

\* Secure OpenStack Provisioning

\* Documenting Security Features

\* Configuration Management

\* Site Survey Functionality / Security Dashboard

\* More

Membership:

In April 2015 the Security SIG became an official part of OpenStack. Previously the security team was comprised of two separate organisations; the VMT and the OSSG. The VMT was a small team handling critical vulnerability reports and remediation whereas the OSSG formed the bulk of the remaining security activities within OpenStack. In early 2015 these teams merged, this was quickly followed by the Security team being accepted into OpenStack.

History of the OSSG:

Originally instigated in 2012 by HP and Nebula, the OSSG initially sought to work on an invite only basis, seeking to draw in contributors from large OpenStack teams such as Rackspace, Ubuntu and Red Hat. The team has grown significantly in size and function and now works on a moderated list model, we're open to contributors of all types and the list is moderated simply to keep out spammers.

In early 2018 what was the Security Project became the Security SIG

Security GIG Code of Ethics:

Members of the security team agree that the goals of the group are to improve the security of OpenStack. Information made available to the security team may at times be sensitive and should always be treated as confidential, not to be shared outside of the group. Members are expressly prohibited from profiting by sharing vulnerability or exploit information obtained from the security team with a third party. All group members agree to abide by industry best practices in responsible disclosure, including providing proper attribution for any technical contributions.

Leadership:

The security SIG has no formal leadership, instead it has chairs, with the current chairs being Luke Hinds (Red Hat) and Gage Hugo (AT&T).

Leadership Functions:

\* Formal liaison with OpenStack teams

\* Security team co-ordination

\* Driving Security Awareness

\* Providing Suggestions for Research Direction

\* More

Ongoing Tasks for the Security SIG:

\* Recruiting security talent

\* Evangelizing security within the community

\* Document current best practices - useful as a documentation exercise and for understanding next steps. (e.g., if best practices involve strongly isolating a particular component b/c it is riddled with security issues, then that will help reveal where we should be working)

\* Develop stress tests that can be integrated with current testing
