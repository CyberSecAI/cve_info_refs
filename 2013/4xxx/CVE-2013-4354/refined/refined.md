```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Glance did not perform checks on tenants during image sharing, allowing a user to add other tenants as members to their images without the consumer tenant's approval using the Image Service API v1.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of tenant validation during image sharing in Glance's Image Service API v1.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user from one tenant can share a potentially malicious image with another tenant, causing it to appear in the target tenant's image list. This could lead users in the target tenant to run the malicious image, potentially compromising their environment.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with an account in one tenant creates a malicious image, then adds a user from another tenant as a member of the image via the Glance API v1. This causes the malicious image to appear in the target tenant's image list.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a valid user account within an OpenStack deployment and the ability to use the Glance API v1."
