- **Root cause of vulnerability:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerability in the gadget renderer of the PHP version of Apache Shindig.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The gadget renderer processes XML without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to XXE injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious gadget author can construct paths to content on the gadget rendering server, causing the server to display the content in the gadget iframe. This can lead to information disclosure of sensitive data present on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious gadget author crafts a malicious gadget that includes an external entity reference in its XML, which is then processed by the vulnerable gadget renderer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create and upload a malicious gadget and have it rendered by a vulnerable instance of Apache Shindig.
