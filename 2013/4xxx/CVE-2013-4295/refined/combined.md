# Shindig Security Issues[¶](#shindig-security-issues "Permanent link")

Please note that, except in rare circumstances, binary patches are not produced for individual vulnerabilities. To obtain the binary fix for a particular
vulnerability you should upgrade to an Apache Shindig version where that vulnerability has been fixed.

Source patches, usually in the form of references to SVN commits, may be provided in either in a vulnerability announcement and/or the vulnerability
details listed on these pages. These source patches may be used by users wishing to build their own local version of Shindig with just that security
patch rather than upgrade.

### Shindig 2.5.0 Vulnerabilities[¶](#shindig-250-vulnerabilities "Permanent link")

This was fixed in revision [1526307](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1526307).

This issue was discovered by Kousuke Ebihara on 12 Aug 2013 and made public on 21 Oct 2013.
