Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The TinyBox module for Drupal, which uses the TinyBox modal window script, does not properly filter user-supplied text before displaying it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's output, which will then be executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Steal cookies or session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the website.
    *   Perform other malicious actions within the user's browser context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the application's web interface.
*   An attacker could inject malicious scripts into fields that are subsequently displayed to other users by the TinyBox module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the "administer tinybox" permission to exploit this vulnerability. This means a lower privileged user would need to gain administrator access, or an administrator with the permission would have to be the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered "Moderately critical" according to Drupal's security risk levels.
*   The vulnerability affects TinyBox module versions 7.x-2.x prior to 7.x-2.1.
*   The issue is fixed in version 7.x-2.2.
