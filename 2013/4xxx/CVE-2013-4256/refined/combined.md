Hamid Zamani discovered multiple security problems (buffer overflows,
format string vulnerabilities and missing input sanitising), which
could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.2-4squeeze1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.3-5wheezy1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in

Subject: nas: Multiple Vulnerabilities in nas 1.9.3
Package: nas
Version: 1.9.3-5

Dear Maintainer,

Recently i found some vulnerabilities that described below.
Some of them maybe are not so effective but it's better to be fixed.
information, i'll send you at this bugreport
If i can help in the process please let me know.

NAS Multiple Vulnerabilities

========================================================================
Buffer OverFlow can be happend at wrong display command  argument

File : server/os/utils.c
Function : ProcessCommandLine

    for (i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
        if (argv[i][0] == ':') {
            display = argv[i];
            display++;

PoC$ nasd :$(python -c 'print "A"*200')
=> overflow ...

---------------------------

File : server/os/access.c
Function : ResetHosts

...
    char fname[32];
...
    strcpy(fname, "/etc/X");
    strcat(fname, display);
    strcat(fname, ".hosts");

---------------------------

File : server/os/connection.c
Function : open_unix_socket

...
        struct utsname systemName;
        static char oldLinkName[256];
...
        uname(&systemName);
        strcpy(oldLinkName, OLD_UNIX_DIR);
        if (!mkdir(oldLinkName, 0777))
            chown(oldLinkName, 2, 3);
        strcat(oldLinkName, "/");
        strcat(oldLinkName, systemName.nodename); // strcat is not safe
        strcat(oldLinkName, display);  // strcat is not safe
        unlink(oldLinkName);
        symlink(unsock.sun_path, oldLinkName);

---------------------------

Function :  open_isc_local

..
    char path[64];
..
    strcat(path, display);

---------------------------

Function :  open_xsight_local

...
    char pathS[64], pathR[64];
...
    sprintf(pathS, "%s%sS", AUDIO_XSIGHT_PATH, display);
    sprintf(pathR, "%s%sR", AUDIO_XSIGHT_PATH, display);

---------------------------

Function : open_att_local
...
    char path[64];
...
    strcpy(path, AUDIO_STREAMS_PATH);
    strcat(path, display);

---------------------------

Function : open_att_svr4_local
...
        char path[64];
...
    strcpy(path, AUDIO_NSTREAMS_PATH);
    strcat(path, display);

========================================================================
Buffer OverFlow can be happend at using getenv and not checking its size

File : server/os/connection.c
Function : CreateWellKnownSockets
...
    char host[100];
...
        if (AuServerHostName == NULL)
            AuServerHostName = getenv("AUDIOHOST");
...
        sprintf(host, "%s/%s:%s", DEF_AUSVRDIR, AuServerHostName,
                0 /* port */ );

---------------------------

Function : AmoebaTCPConnectorThread
...
    char name[BUFSIZ];
...
        sprintf(name, "%s/%s", TCP_SVR_NAME, AuTcpServerName);

========================================================================
Heap OverFlow may happen at using getenv and not checking its size

File : server/os/connection.c
Function : AmoebaConnectorThread

...
    if ((repb = (char *) malloc(REPLY_BUFSIZE)) == NULL)
...
        case STD_INFO:
            rep.h_status = STD_OK;
            sprintf(repb, "audio server on %s", AuServerHostName);
...

========================================================================
Format String Vulnerability may occur at misusing functions like syslog

File : server/os/aulog.c: +40
Function : osLogMsg
...
        openlog("nas", LOG_PID, LOG_DAEMON);
        syslog(LOG_DEBUG, buf); // possible format string vulnerability  ,
syslog(LOG_DEBUG, %s, buf)
        closelog();

========================================================================
Possible Buffer OverFlow may occur when the size of buffer is not checked.

File : server/os/aulog.c:: +27
Function : osLogMsg

 ...
     static char buf[LOG_BUFSIZE];
...
    (void) vsprintf(buf, fmt, ap); // it's highly recomended to use
functions
like vsnprintf

========================================================================
Possible Race Condition and symlink attack:

File : server/os/connection.c:

    tcp_dev = getenv("TCP_DEVICE"); // Need check
    if (tcp_dev == NULL)
        tcp_dev = TCP_DEVICE;

    fd = open(tcp_dev, O_RDWR); // O_RDWR => results corrupting data

Ok so we got a total of three kinds of vulns, so same
version/researcher I'm CVE MERGEing them:

Buffer Overflows please use CVE-2013-4256
Heap Overflow please use CVE-2013-4257
Format String please use CVE-2013-4258

As for "Possible Race Condition and symlink attack:" can we confirm
it's a security issue?
