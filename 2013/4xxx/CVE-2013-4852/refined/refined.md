{
  "CVE-2013-4852": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow during the SSH handshake due to improper bounds checking of the length parameter received from the SSH server when processing RSA key signatures.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Heap-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (crash) and possibly arbitrary code execution. A remote attacker can crash the client by sending a malicious RSA key signature with a negative size value.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious SSH server or a man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RSA key signature during the SSH handshake.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or establish an SSH connection with a vulnerable client."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Negative string length in public-key signatures.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Integer Overflow"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Integer overflow can cause memory overwrite, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.",
        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the SSH handshake, when the client parses a signature from the server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a malicious SSH server or a man-in-the-middle attacker between the client and the server."
