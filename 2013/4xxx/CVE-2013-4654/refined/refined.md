        "Buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the ACSD service.",
        "The service runs with root privileges, amplifying the impact of the overflow."

      "impact": "Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow allows an attacker to gain full administrative control over the router by executing arbitrary code with root permissions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote unauthenticated attack by sending a crafted command to the vulnerable ACSD service."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the router and have the ability to send network traffic to port TCP/5916 to exploit the ACSD service."

      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a misconfiguration in the SMB service that allows the creation of symbolic links.",

        "Misconfigured SMB service that allows symbolic links to traverse outside of the intended share.",
        "Lack of proper access controls on the file system, allowing read and write access to sensitive files."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can use the SMB symlink traversal vulnerability to access sensitive system files (like passwd) or to write files to arbitrary locations on the router, which can lead to full control of the router.",

      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the router and be able to send SMB requests."

      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a PHP file inclusion vulnerability and a race condition when the router executes shell scripts.",

         "PHP file inclusion vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.",
         "Race condition when creating and executing shell scripts, allowing an attacker to overwrite the script."

     "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a combination of insecure default settings, a misconfigured SMB service, and improper file permissions.",
