{
  "CVE-ID": "CVE-2013-4786",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The IPMI 2.0 specification's RAKP authentication protocol is vulnerable. During the authentication process, the BMC sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the requested user's password to the client before the client authenticates. This hash can be captured and cracked offline.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The RAKP protocol leaks password hashes.",
      "The IPMI 2.0 specification mandates the transmission of password hashes, making it inherently vulnerable."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, specifically the password hashes, potentially enabling unauthorized access if the hashes are cracked.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network access to the IPMI interface."
    ],
    "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to communicate with the IPMI interface of a NetApp product. No specific privileges are required initially, but a valid IPMI account name is needed to trigger the vulnerability. Furthermore, strong cryptography and passwords, or network isolation, are recommended to reduce the effectiveness of offline dictionary attacks"
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H610C",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H610S",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H615C",
    "NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)",
    "StorageGRID Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)"
  ],
    "remediation": "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) have no plans to address this vulnerability. For StorageGRID Baseboard Management Controller (BMC), remote IPMI access can be disabled. Workarounds include restricting access to the BMC management interface to secure and trusted networks, physically disconnecting the BMC from the network, or isolating IPMI traffic over UDP port 623. Utilizing strong cryptography and passwords can reduce the effectiveness of offline dictionary attacks."
