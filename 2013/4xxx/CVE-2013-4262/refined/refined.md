- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `svnwcsub.py` and `irkerbridge.py` scripts, when using the `--pidfile` option, do not properly validate if the provided pidfile path is a symlink. They overwrite the file pointed to by the path. This can lead to a symlink attack.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Symlink vulnerability:** The scripts do not check if the pidfile path is a symlink before writing to it.
    - **Insecure file handling:** The scripts use `open(self.pidfile, 'w').write('%d\n' % pid)` which truncates the file before writing. 
    - **Improper daemonization:** The `daemonize.py` module, used by the scripts, also suffers from this symlink vulnerability.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Privilege escalation:** An attacker can create a symlink to a file owned by a more privileged user, and the script, when run, will overwrite that file with its process ID. This can lead to various consequences, including the corruption of system files, altering application configurations, or execution of arbitrary code.
    - **Denial of service:** An attacker can make the pid file point to a critical file, causing the script to overwrite it. This can impact other services and programs that depend on the targeted file. 
    - **Process killing:** When stopping the service, scripts might try to kill the process using the content of the pidfile. If the pidfile has been changed to point to another process, the wrong process may get killed, leading to denial of service.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Local access:** An attacker needs local access to the machine where the tools are running.
    - **Writable directory:** The attacker needs write access to the directory where the pid file is located.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have local access to the server where the vulnerable scripts are being executed.
    - The attacker needs to have write permissions to the directory where the pidfile is stored.
    - The vulnerable scripts must be invoked using the `--pidfile` option.
