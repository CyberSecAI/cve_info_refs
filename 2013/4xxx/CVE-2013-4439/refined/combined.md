See also [#7353](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/7353)

The master currently allows any minion with an accepted key to send commands to the master as any other minion. This pull request requires that commands sent from a minion to the master include a token encrypted with the minion's public key.

Unfortunately, requiring this token breaks backwards compatibility with all previous minion versions. I have added "require\_aes\_tokens: False" to the master config, and the master will allow old minions to send commands without a token unless require\_aes\_tokens is set to True. I gave it a warn\_until version 0.20 to allow for salt admins to upgrade their minions to at least 0.17 (assuming this pull request gets included in 0.17)

I think salt should, by default, not trust the minions as much as possible. This greatly reduces the ability of evil minions to do nasty things.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| We should not refer to the token as aes and the verify as rsa, since these are routines that can be updated in the future and they are not cryptographic per-say. This is just a simple id challenge. Also, this warning will FLOOD the logs and be a very bad thing. This warning should just be posted once when the master starts up |

| [@thatch45](https://github.com/thatch45) you're right. I renamed them to be properly descriptive and moved the log deprecation so it only logs once, but I think I'm going to close this and refactor some things on a new branch. |
