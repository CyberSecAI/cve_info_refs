The provided content is related to multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager, including CVE-2013-3402, CVE-2013-3403, CVE-2013-3404, CVE-2013-3412, CVE-2013-3433 and CVE-2013-3434. This advisory describes multiple vulnerabilities that, when combined, could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gather user credentials, escalate privileges, and execute commands.

Here is a breakdown of each individual vulnerability mentioned within the advisory:

**1. Blind SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-3404, CVE-2013-3412):**
   - **Root Cause:** Failure to properly validate user-supplied requests before using them to form an SQL query.
    - **Vulnerability:** SQL injection.
   - **Impact:** An attacker could disclose or modify arbitrary information in the database.
   - **Attack Vector:**  Remote, via the default management ports, TCP ports 8080 or 8443.
   - **Required Capabilities:**
        - **CVE-2013-3404:** Unauthenticated remote attacker. Allows attacker to recreate encrypted information including credentials using metadata.
        - **CVE-2013-3412:** Authenticated remote attacker. Allows attacker to modify or insert data into certain database tables.

**2. Hard-Coded Encryption Key (no CVE mentioned):**
   - **Root Cause:** Use of a static symmetric encryption key in all Cisco Unified CM versions.
   - **Vulnerability:** Hard-coded encryption key.
   - **Impact:** An attacker could decrypt sensitive data, including user credentials. Could be used in combination with other vulnerabilities
   - **Attack Vector:** Exploitation requires access to the system or data.
   - **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs the hardcoded key and access to encrypted data or CTI communication.

**3. Command Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2013-3402):**
   - **Root Cause:** Improper validation of user-supplied input.
   - **Vulnerability:** Command injection.
   - **Impact:** An authenticated remote attacker could execute commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the database user.
   - **Attack Vector:** Remote, authenticated attacker submitting malicious input to the affected function.
   - **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated remote access to the vulnerable function.

**4. Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-3403, CVE-2013-3434, CVE-2013-3433):**
   - **Root Cause:** Improper file permissions, environment variables, and relative paths in privileged system scripts or binaries.
   - **Vulnerability:** Privilege escalation.
   - **Impact:** An authenticated local attacker could gain complete control of the affected system by modifying certain system scripts.
   - **Attack Vector:** Local access, modifying system scripts.
   - **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated local access.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1(x)
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.5(x)
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.6(x)
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0(x)
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.1(x)
- Cisco Unified Presence Server/IM & Presence Service versions 9.1(2) and prior (affected by hard-coded encryption key issue)
