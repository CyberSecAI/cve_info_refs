How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=== Security Advisory ===

ldap-account-manager-4.3 - PreAuth XSS
------------------------------------------------------------

Affected Version
================
ldap-account-manager-4.3, ldap-account-manager-4.2.1
and possibly others

Problem Overview
================
Technical Risk: medium
Likelihood of Exploitation: medium
Vendor: Debian / Roland Gruber
Reported by: Eric Sesterhenn <snakebyte@gmx.de>
Advisory updates: <http://www.rusty-ice.de/advisory/advisory_2013001.txt>
Advisory Status: Private

Problem Impact
==============
While taking a quick lock at the ldap account manager,
a XSS issue has been found. It is possible to execute JavaScript
in a victims' browser after tricking the victim to post certain data
to the website.

Problem Description
===================
The file "./templates/login.php" contains an Cross-Site-Scripting
Issue on line 122. When the parameter current_language is set to
malicious input (e.g. foo%3A"><script>alert(1)</script>%3Abar)
JavaScript is executed in the victims' browser.
The parameter current_language is retrieved
from $_SESSION['language'] in line 119, which
is a copy of $_POST['language'] (line 117).

Temporary Workaround and Fix
============================
Apply the following patch to properly encode the variable:

--- templates/login.php.orig    2013-09-25 07:53:03.107208062 +0200
+++ templates/login.php 2013-09-25 07:53:20.715207533 +0200

thanks

Hi

As the attack vector includes that malicious data via POST I think
it's safe to downgrade the severity to important.

p.s.: I have requested a CVE for this issue on the oss-security list.

Salvatore

thanks for the quick reply. The patch looks good to me, even if this
issue is still exploitable with a malicious cookie (but I dont see a way
to place such data into a cookie for an attacker).

To nitpick, the description "E.g. it is not sufficient to click on a link."
is not correct, if the victim clicks on a link to a different
web-site, which contains a web form and JavaScript to submit this form automatically
this can be exploited without requiring more user interaction.

Regards, Eric
