Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-4567:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Incomplete blacklist in the CSS sanitizer function of MediaWiki.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Vertical Tab Bypass:** The CSS sanitizer could be bypassed by using a vertical tab character (`\b`, ASCII 11) within the CSS code, specifically in the `url()` function. This allows attackers to inject malicious URLs.
-   **Blacklist Approach:** The use of a blacklist, instead of a whitelist, made it difficult to anticipate and prevent all possible malicious inputs, making the sanitizer fragile.
-   **Encoding Issues:**  The use of fullwidth characters, superscript/subscript parentheses and other special characters to inject malicious expressions.
-   **Browser Inconsistencies:** IE6 interprets certain Unicode characters differently, allowing bypass of blacklist.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious CSS, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This allows them to perform actions as that user, steal cookies, deface the website, and more.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **CSS injection:** The primary attack vector is injecting malicious CSS code via a style attribute.
-   **Wikitext:** The attacker injects the malicious CSS within wikitext, which is then processed and rendered by MediaWiki.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Ability to edit wikitext:** The attacker needs to be able to input wikitext, including CSS styling, to a MediaWiki instance. This could be done through normal page editing or via other input mechanisms that allow CSS.
-   **Knowledge of bypass techniques:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific bypasses for the CSS sanitizer, such as the vertical tab, fullwidth characters, etc.

**Additional Technical Details (From Bugzilla):**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when `$wgUseTidy = true` for the vertical tab bypass, but the fullwidth and small caps attacks against IE6 work regardless of the setting.
*   The issue is related to how IE6 handles character encoding and string parsing, allowing substitution of special characters for parts of "expression" and other function names, which are then executed.
*   Multiple unicode characters (e.g., U+207D, U+208D, U+3031, U+309D, U+30FC, U+30FD, U+FE7C, U+FE7D, U+FF70)  can be used to bypass the blacklist.
*   The fix involves adding checks for the vertical tab and these special characters to prevent the injection.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of MediaWiki (1.19.x, 1.20.x, 1.21.x)
*   The fix was backported to the relevant versions of MediaWiki.
