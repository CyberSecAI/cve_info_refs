Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which aligns with CVE-2013-4788:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the glibc's failure to properly initialize the "pointer guard" with a random value when generating statically compiled executables. Instead, it is always set to zero. This is a problem in versions of glibc from 2.4 (06-Mar-2006) to 2.17.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Randomization:** The pointer guard, which is intended to be a random value used in pointer mangling, is set to zero in statically linked executables. This effectively disables the pointer mangling protection.
- **Vulnerable Pointer Mangling:** The PTR_MANGLE and PTR_DEMANGLE macros, used to protect sensitive pointers like those in `jmp_buf`, rely on XORing with the pointer guard value. If the guard is zero, the XOR operation becomes a no-op, leaving pointers unprotected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can redirect the program's execution flow. When a function like `longjmp()` is called, the attacker can control the destination address, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability can be leveraged when a buffer overflow or similar memory corruption vulnerability exists. This allows the attacker to overwrite the "env" structure, a structure used by `longjmp`, with a crafted address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system to execute the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to cause a buffer overflow:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger a buffer overflow or similar vulnerability that lets him overwrite memory that is used by the `longjmp` function.
- **Understanding of pointer mangling:** The attacker needs to understand the details of pointer mangling and how `longjmp` is used to redirect execution flow.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects statically linked applications compiled with glibc and eglibc, regardless of the operating system distribution. Dynamic executables are not affected.
- A proof-of-concept exploit exists, demonstrating how to redirect execution flow to a shell. Exploits were created for x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) and ARM architectures.
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of glibc from 2.4 to 2.17.
- A patch has been created to correctly initialize the pointer guard in static executables. However, to fully mitigate the issue, all existing static executables need to be recompiled.
