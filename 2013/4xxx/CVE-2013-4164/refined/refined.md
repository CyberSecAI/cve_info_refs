Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow flaw exists in the way Ruby parses floating-point numbers from their text representation. Specifically, the `strtod` implementation within Ruby is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap overflow vulnerability due to improper parsing of floating point numbers.
- Lack of input sanitization.
- Integer overflow issue in LibYAML's handling of YAML tags can lead to further issues if the application is using YAML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the application to crash via segmentation faults, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application that is using the vulnerable Ruby library, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through specially crafted strings that are converted to floating-point values.
- Any application that accepts external input, parses this input, and converts it to floating-point values is potentially vulnerable. This particularly impacts applications that parse formats like JSON, XML or YAML.
- Can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted string that is then converted to a floating point number by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2009-0689.
- Affects Ruby 1.8 versions after Ruby 1.8.6 patchlevel 230, all Ruby 1.9 versions prior to Ruby 1.9.3 patchlevel 484, all Ruby 2.0 versions prior to Ruby 2.0.0 patchlevel 353, all Ruby 2.1 versions prior to Ruby 2.1.0 preview2 and before trunk revision 43780.
- The issue is not present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as its Ruby is based on an older upstream version, where the vulnerable strtod implementation wasn't used.
- Fix was backported to affected versions.
- This vulnerability is triggered within the strtod function.
- There was a follow up patch to fix additional bugs discovered during the analysis of the fix.

**Summary of Affected Software:**

- Red Hat OpenStack 3.0
- Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.x
- Red Hat Software Collections 1 for RHEL
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (various versions and architectures)
- Ubuntu Linux (various versions)
- SUSE Studio Onsite 1.3
- openSUSE (versions 12.2, 12.3, and 13.1)
- Debian (squeeze, wheezy, sid)
- OS X Server v4.0 (Profile Manager)
