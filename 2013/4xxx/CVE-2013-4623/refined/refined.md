Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the logic of parsing PEM-encoded certificates within the `x509parse_crt()` function of the PolarSSL library. Specifically, an issue occurs when handling PEM formatted data, leading to an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The core weakness is the potential for an infinite loop during the parsing process of PEM encoded certificates. This occurs due to the way `x509parse_crt()` handles PEM formatted data, which can be triggered by maliciously crafted certificate data

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The infinite loop consumes excessive CPU resources, rendering the affected system unresponsive or severely degraded in performance. This can affect systems acting as TLS/SSL servers using the vulnerable version of the PolarSSL library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Certificates:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted, malicious PEM-encoded certificate to a vulnerable application or service that uses PolarSSL. The vulnerability is triggered when the application/service attempts to parse this malformed certificate.
- **Network Attacks:** A remote attacker could trigger this vulnerability on a TLS/SSL server by providing the malicious PEM data during the handshake process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have a way to send the malicious certificate data to the vulnerable system/service. This typically involves network connectivity.
- **TLS/SSL Handshake Trigger:** For TLS/SSL servers, the attack can be triggered during the handshake process when the server attempts to parse the provided certificate.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by directly calling  `x509parse_crt_der()`  instead of the wrapper function `x509parse_crt()`.
- The vulnerability was corrected in PolarSSL versions 1.1.7 and 1.2.8.
- The vulnerability exists in versions prior to the fixed versions.
