| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=997767#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-08-16 07:55:56 UTC  ``` From the PolarSSL Security Advisory 2013-03 advisory:  "A bug in the logic of the parsing of PEM encoded certificates in x509parse_crt() can result in an infinite loop, thus hogging processing power."  A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server using PolarSSL consume an excessive amount of CPU.  This issue was corrected in PolarSSL versions 1.1.7 and 1.2.8. (Versions prior to these are affected.)

Package        : polarssl
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4623 CVE-2013-5914 CVE-2013-5915

Multiple security issues have been discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight
crypto and SSL/TLS library:

CVE-2013-4623

    Jack Lloyd discovered a denial of service vulnerability in the
    parsing of PEM-encoded certificates.

CVE-2013-5914

    Paul Brodeur and TrustInSoft discovered a buffer overflow in the
    ssl_read_record() function, allowing the potential execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2013-5915

    Cyril Arnaud and Pierre-Alain Fouque discovered timimg attacks against
    the RSA implementation.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed in
version 1.2.9-1~deb6u1 soon (due to a technical limitation the updates
cannot be released synchronously).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.9-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.
