Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing NULL pointer check within the FreeRDP server-side code. Specifically, the code attempts to use a pointer without verifying if it's valid, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is the lack of a check for a NULL pointer before it's used. This missing check can lead to a crash when the pointer is NULL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability causes a server crash, leading to a denial of service for legitimate clients trying to connect.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specifically crafted packets to a vulnerable FreeRDP server. This could happen during the RDP handshake or session establishment phase.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the targeted FreeRDP server.
*   **RDP Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the RDP protocol to craft the malicious packets that trigger the vulnerability, specifically related to decryption and security flags.
*   **No Authentication:**  The vulnerability can be triggered without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a NULL pointer check in `security.c` before `rc4_decrypt_key` pointer is used.
*   The vulnerability is server-side, meaning it affects the FreeRDP server component, not the client.
*   The SUSE security advisory indicates a moderate severity level.

In summary, CVE-2013-4118 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the FreeRDP server caused by a missing NULL pointer check. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets, leading to a server crash.
