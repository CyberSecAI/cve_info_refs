```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Simplenews module for Drupal does not sufficiently sanitize email addresses before outputting them. While forms provided by the module validate email addresses, the API can be used to add email addresses directly without validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper email address sanitization before outputting it."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the email addresses stored in the database. When these addresses are displayed in the application, the scripts will be executed in the browsers of users, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves adding malicious code within an email address via the Simplenews module's API. This bypasses the validation performed by forms provided by the module.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to utilize the Simplenews API through another module (custom or contributed). This likely requires an understanding of how the Simplenews API is designed to register subscribers."
