# [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-080 - Simplenews - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

---

*From*: security-news () drupal org

*Date*: Wed, 16 Oct 2013 18:59:05 +0000 (UTC)

---

```
View online: <https://drupal.org/node/2113515>

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-080
  * Project: Simplenews [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-Month-DD
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to publish and send newsletters to lists of
subscribers.
The module also includes an API that other modules can use to register
subscribers.
The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize e-mail addresses prior to
outputting. The provided forms (sign-up, mass import, ..) validate and only
allow valid e-mail addresses, but e-mail addresses could also be added
directly through the API, which does not validate.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the Simplnews module
performs input validation which prevents known attacks, so the injection
vector must be added another module (custom or contributed) without
validating the email address using the Simplenews API .

-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

  * Simplenews 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.5.
  * Simplenews 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Simplenews [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Simplenews module for Drupal 6.x-1.x, upgrade to Simplenews
    6.x-1.5 [5]
  * If you use the Simplenews module for Drupal 7.x-1.x, upgrade to Simplenews
    7.x-1.1 [6]

Also see the Simplenews [7] project page.

-------- REPORTED BY
---------------------------------------------------------

  * Pat Redmond [8]

-------- FIXED BY
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Sascha Grossenbacher [9] the module maintainer

-------- COORDINATED BY
------------------------------------------------------

  * Greg Knaddison [10] and Lee Rowlands [11] of the Drupal Security Team

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
