{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Verizon Wireless Network Extender models SCS-26UC4 and SCS-2U01 have vulnerabilities that allow console access using a custom HDMI cable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "**SCS-26UC4:** Exploitable Uboot bootloader delay.",
      "**SCS-2U01:** Exploitable SysReq interrupt.",
      "Lack of CAVE Authentication: Only uses ESN and MIN for cellular phone authentication.",
      "Published root password."
    ],
    "impact": "Compromise of the device allows an attacker to run custom code and eavesdrop on voice, text and data communication for mobile devices connected to the network extender. Additionally, attackers can clone phones within range due to the lack of proper authentication.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Local access to the device using a custom HDMI cable is required to exploit console access vulnerabilities.",
       "Sniffing registration packets or obtaining physical access to a phone is required for phone cloning."
     ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs physical access to the device and the ability to create a custom HDMI cable to exploit the vulnerabilities. For phone cloning, the attacker needs either physical access to a phone or the ability to sniff registration packets."
