Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within specific `.swf` files distributed with the Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) library. These files, particularly those associated with the `IO Utility` and `Uploader` components, were susceptible to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is that the affected `.swf` files did not properly sanitize or validate input. Specifically, they allowed arbitrary strings to be passed in and executed as JavaScript within the context of the hosted `.swf` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL targeting a vulnerable `.swf` file. When a user accessed this crafted URL, the injected JavaScript would execute within the security context of the domain hosting the `.swf` file.
*   **Cookie and Sensitive Information Exposure:** By executing JavaScript, the attacker could potentially steal session cookies, access other sensitive information belonging to the user, or perform unauthorized actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector involves a crafted URL specifically designed to exploit the vulnerability. This URL would directly access the vulnerable `.swf` file and inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Files:** The attacker must know which specific `.swf` files are vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to create malicious URLs that target the vulnerable `.swf` files and include the malicious JavaScript.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker would need to entice or trick a user into clicking the malicious URL.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affected all versions of YUI from 3.0.0 through 3.10.0 and resurfaced in version 3.10.2 for `io.swf` only.
*   The affected files include `io.swf`, `uploader.swf`, and `flashuploader.swf`.
*   The vulnerability is also tracked under [CVE-2013-4939](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4939), [CVE-2013-4940](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4940), [CVE-2013-4941](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4941), and [CVE-2013-4942](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4942).
*   The issue was reported by Aleksandr Dobkin and Sebastian Roschke of the Google Security Team.
*   Patched versions of the files are provided for download, and the vulnerability is resolved on the Yahoo! CDN.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Moodle as part of MDL-39678.
