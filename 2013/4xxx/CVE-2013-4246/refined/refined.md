Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation in how Subversion's FSFS (File System File System) repository handles the packing of revision properties (revprops). Specifically, when a packed revprop is modified with larger data, Subversion might split the existing pack file. The logic to update the manifest file, which tracks which revisions are in which pack files, contains a flaw, causing it to delete the wrong pack file and incorrectly map revisions to pack files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incorrect Pack File Deletion:** When a pack file needs to be split due to a size increase in revprops, the code incorrectly identifies the pack file to be deleted. Instead of removing the pack file containing the modified revision, it may delete the first pack file in the sequence, resulting in data loss.
2.  **Incorrect Manifest Mapping:** After splitting, the manifest file is updated with the incorrect mappings of revisions to pack files. This causes the system to return the wrong data when queried.
3.  **Inconsistent state**: After revprop update, the manifest and packed files are in an inconsistent state. This leads to other issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Data Loss:** Deletion of the wrong pack file leads to the loss of revision property data for earlier revisions.
2.  **Data Corruption:** Incorrect mappings in the manifest file cause the system to retrieve and return wrong revision properties, leading to data corruption.
3.  **Service Disruption:**
    *   Export or checkout operations may fail or return incorrect results due to corrupted commit time stamps in the revprops.
    *   'svn log' may report log messages and other revprops for the wrong revisions, potentially leaking confidential information through bypassing authorization filters.
4.  **Access to Confidential Information:** Because revprops can hold confidential data, the incorrect mapping can lead to unauthorized access to it.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
2.  **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have commit access and write permissions to revision properties (revprops). This implies that the attacker would already need to be a legitimate user of the SVN repository with specific permissions.
3.  **Revision Property Modification:** The attacker needs to modify revision properties, especially with large data, which triggers the pack splitting logic.
4.  **Packing Required:** The repository must use the FSFS format introduced with Subversion 1.8, must have been packed using `svnadmin pack` , and the administrator has to enable the ability to modify revprops, and the pack splitting logic must be invoked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Commit Access:** The attacker must have commit access to the Subversion repository.
2.  **Write Access to Revprops:**  The attacker must have the ability to modify revision properties, which is an opt-in setting and has to be configured.
3.  **Packed Repository:** The repository must be an FSFS repository, created or upgraded to the 1.8 format, and have been packed using 'svnadmin pack'.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Subversion servers versions 1.8.0 and 1.8.1.
*   It only affects FSFS repositories created with Subversion 1.8 or upgraded to that format. BDB repositories are not vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Subversion 1.8.2 and later.
*   The provided patch highlights that the issue involves incorrect indexing into the `manifest` array when updating the manifest. The `start_revision` variable was being used directly as the index while it should have been offset by `manifest_start`.
