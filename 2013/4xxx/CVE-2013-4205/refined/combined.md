# USN-1974-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

27 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Vince Weaver discovered a flaw in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel on

ARM platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4254](/security/CVE-2013-4254))

A memory leak was discovered in the user namespace facility of the Linux

kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (memory consumption)

via the CLONE\_NEWUSER unshare call. ([CVE-2013-4205](/security/CVE-2013-4205))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-31-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.8.0-31.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.8.0-31.46)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

userns: unshare\_userns(&cred) should not populate cred on failure

```
unshare_userns(new_cred) does *new_cred = prepare_creds() before
create_user_ns() which can fail. However, the caller expects that
it doesn't need to take care of new_cred if unshare_userns() fails.

We could change the single caller, sys_unshare(), but I think it
would be more clean to avoid the side effects on failure, so with
this patch unshare_userns() does put_cred() itself and initializes
*new_cred only if create_user_ns() succeeeds.

iwlwifi: dvm: don't send BT\_CONFIG on devices w/o Bluetooth
commit 707aee401d2467baa785a697f40a6e2d9ee79ad5 upstream.
The BT\_CONFIG command that is sent to the device during
startup will enable BT coex unless the module parameter
turns it off, but on devices without Bluetooth this may
cause problems, as reported in Redhat BZ 885407.
Fix this by sending the BT\_CONFIG command only when the
device has Bluetooth.

iwlwifi: mvm: set SSID bits for passive channels
commit bb963c4a43eb5127eb0bbfa16c7a6a209b0af5db upstream.
Set SSID bitmap for direct scan even on passive channels,
for the passive-to-active feature. Without this patch only
the SSID from probe request template is sent on passive
channels, after passive-to-active switching, causing us to
not find all desired networks.
Remove the unused passive scan mask constant.

Slaves get the 64B CQE/EQE state from QUERY\_HCA, not from the module parameter.
If the parameter is set to zero, the slave outputs an incorrect/irrelevant

net/mlx4\_core: Don't give VFs MAC addresses which are derived from the PF MAC
[ Upstream commit 0508ad646836007e6e6b62331eee7356844eac3d ]
If the user has not assigned a MAC address to a VM, then don't give it MAC which
is based on the PF one. The current derivation scheme is wrong and leads to VM
MAC collisions when the number of cards/hypervisors becomes big enough.
Instead, just give it zeros and let them figure out what to do with that.

It showed several backtraces arising for dma\_map\_\* usage without checking the
return code on the mapping. Add the check and abort the rx/tx operation if its
failed. Untested as I have no hardware and the reporter has wandered off, but
seems pretty straightforward.

atl1c: use custom skb allocator
[ Upstream commit 7b70176421993866e616f1cbc4d0dd4054f1bf78 ]
We had reports ( https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=54021 )
that using high order pages for skb allocations is problematic for atl1c
We do not know exactly what the problem is, but we suspect that crossing
4K pages is not well supported by this hardware.
Use a custom allocator, using page allocator and 2K fragments for
optimal stack behavior. We might make this allocator generic
in future kernels.

usbnet: do not pretend to support SG/TSO
[ Upstream commit 20f0170377264e8449b6987041f0bcc4d746d3ed ]
usbnet doesn't support yet SG, so drivers should not advertise SG or TSO
capabilities, as they allow TCP stack to build large TSO packets that
need to be linearized and might use order-5 pages.
This adds an extra copy overhead and possible allocation failures.
Current code ignore skb\_linearize() return code so crashes are even
possible.
Best is to not pretend SG/TSO is supported, and add this again when/if
usbnet really supports SG for devices who could get a performance gain.

userns: unshare\_userns(&cred) should not populate cred on failure
commit 6160968cee8b90a5dd95318d716e31d7775c4ef3 upstream.
unshare\_userns(new\_cred) does \*new\_cred = prepare\_creds() before
create\_user\_ns() which can fail. However, the caller expects that
it doesn't need to take care of new\_cred if unshare\_userns() fails.
We could change the single caller, sys\_unshare(), but I think it
would be more clean to avoid the side effects on failure, so with
this patch unshare\_userns() does put\_cred() itself and initializes
\*new\_cred only if create\_user\_ns() succeeeds.

workqueue: copy workqueue\_attrs with all fields
commit 2865a8fb44cc32420407362cbda80c10fa09c6b2 upstream.
$echo '0' > /sys/bus/workqueue/devices/xxx/numa
$cat /sys/bus/workqueue/devices/xxx/numa
I got 1. It should be 0, the reason is copy\_workqueue\_attrs() called
in apply\_workqueue\_attrs() doesn't copy no\_numa field.
Fix it by making copy\_workqueue\_attrs() copy ->no\_numa too. This
would also make get\_unbound\_pool() set a pool's ->no\_numa attribute
according to the workqueue attributes used when the pool was created.
While harmelss, as ->no\_numa isn't a pool attribute, this is a bit
confusing. Clear it explicitly.

The find\_next\_bit\_left function is broken if used with an offset which
is not a multiple of 64. The shift to mask the bits of a 64-bit word
not to search is in the wrong direction, the result can be either a

Btrfs: fix crash regarding to ulist\_add\_merge
commit 35f0399db6658f465b00893bdd13b992a0acfef0 upstream.
Several users reported this crash of NULL pointer or general protection,
the story is that we add a rbtree for speedup ulist iteration, and we
use krealloc() to address ulist growth, and krealloc() use memcpy to copy
old data to new memory area, so it's OK for an array as it doesn't use
pointers while it's not OK for a rbtree as it uses pointers.
So krealloc() will mess up our rbtree and it ends up with crash.

commit 084457f284abf6789d90509ee11dae383842b23b upstream.
cgroup\_cfts\_commit() uses dget() to keep cgroup alive after cgroup\_mutex

xen-blkfront: use a different scatterlist for each request
commit b7649158a0d241f8d53d13ff7441858539e16656 upstream.
In blkif\_queue\_request blkfront iterates over the scatterlist in order
to set the segments of the request, and in blkif\_completion blkfront
iterates over the raw request, which makes it hard to know the exact
position of the source and destination memory positions.
This can be solved by allocating a scatterlist for each request, that
will be keep until the request is finished, allowing us to copy the
data back to the original memory without having to iterate over the
raw request.

PCI: Retry allocation of only the resource type that failed
commit aa914f5ec25e4371ba18b312971314be1b9b1076 upstream.
Ben Herrenschmidt reported the following problem:
- The bus has space for all desired MMIO resources, including optional
space for SR-IOV devices
- We attempt to allocate I/O port space, but it fails because the bus
has no I/O space
- Because of the I/O allocation failure, we retry MMIO allocation,
requesting only the required space, without the optional SR-IOV space
This means we don't allocate the optional SR-IOV space, even though we
could.
This is related to 0c5be0cb0e ("PCI: Retry on IORESOURCE\_IO type
allocations").
This patch changes how we handle allocation failures. We will now retry
allocation of only the resource type that failed. If MMIO allocation
fails, we'll retry only MMIO allocation. If I/O port allocation fails,
we'll retry only I/O port allocation.

PCI: pciehp: Fix null pointer deref when hot-removing SR-IOV device
commit 29ed1f29b68a8395d5679b3c4e38352b617b3236 upstream.
Hot-removing a device with SR-IOV enabled causes a null pointer dereference
in v3.9 and v3.10.
This is a regression caused by ba518e3c17 ("PCI: pciehp: Iterate over all
devices in slot, not functions 0-7"). When we iterate over the
bus->devices list, we first remove the PF, which also removes all the VFs
from the list. Then the list iterator blows up because more than just the
current entry was removed from the list.
ac205b7bb7 ("PCI: make sriov work with hotplug remove") works around a
similar problem in pci\_stop\_bus\_devices() by iterating over the list in
reverse, so the VFs are stopped and removed from the list first, before the
PF.
This patch changes pciehp\_unconfigure\_device() to iterate over the list in
reverse, too.

Revert "cpuidle: Quickly notice prediction failure for repeat mode"
commit 148519120c6d1f19ad53349683aeae9f228b0b8d upstream.
Revert commit 69a37bea (cpuidle: Quickly notice prediction failure for
repeat mode), because it has been identified as the source of a
significant performance regression in v3.8 and later as explained by
Jeremy Eder:
We believe we've identified a particular commit to the cpuidle code
that seems to be impacting performance of variety of workloads.
The simplest way to reproduce is using netperf TCP\_RR test, so
we're using that, on a pair of Sandy Bridge based servers. We also
have data from a large database setup where performance is also
measurably/positively impacted, though that test data isn't easily
share-able.
Included below are test results from 3 test kernels:
kernel reverts
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) vanilla upstream (no reverts)
2) perfteam2 reverts e11538d1f03914eb92af5a1a378375c05ae8520c
3) test reverts 69a37beabf1f0a6705c08e879bdd5d82ff6486c4
e11538d1f03914eb92af5a1a378375c05ae8520c
In summary, netperf TCP\_RR numbers improve by approximately 4%
after reverting 69a37beabf1f0a6705c08e879bdd5d82ff6486c4. When
69a37beabf1f0a6705c08e879bdd5d82ff6486c4 is included, C0 residency
never seems to get above 40%. Taking that patch out gets C0 near
100% quite often, and performance increases.
The below data are histograms representing the %c0 residency @
1-second sample rates (using turbostat), while under netperf test.
- If you look at the first 4 histograms, you can see %c0 residency
almost entirely in the 30,40% bin.
- The last pair, which reverts 69a37beabf1f0a6705c08e879bdd5d82ff6486c4,
shows %c0 in the 80,90,100% bins.
Below each kernel name are netperf TCP\_RR trans/s numbers for the
particular kernel that can be disclosed publicly, comparing the 3
test kernels. We ran a 4th test with the vanilla kernel where
we've also set /dev/cpu\_dma\_latency=0 to show overall impact
boosting single-threaded TCP\_RR performance over 11% above
baseline.

cpufreq: Fix cpufreq driver module refcount balance after suspend/resume
commit 2a99859932281ed6c2ecdd988855f8f6838f6743 upstream.
Since cpufreq\_cpu\_put() called by \_\_cpufreq\_remove\_dev() drops the
driver module refcount, \_\_cpufreq\_remove\_dev() causes that refcount
to become negative for the cpufreq driver after a suspend/resume
cycle.
This is not the only bad thing that happens there, however, because
kobject\_put() should only be called for the policy kobject at this
point if the CPU is not the last one for that policy.
Namely, if the given CPU is the last one for that policy, the
policy kobject's refcount should be 1 at this point, as set by
cpufreq\_add\_dev\_interface(), and only needs to be dropped once for
the kobject to go away. This actually happens under the cpu == 1
check, so it need not be done before by cpufreq\_cpu\_put().
On the other hand, if the given CPU is not the last one for that
policy, this means that cpufreq\_add\_policy\_cpu() has been called
at least once for that policy and cpufreq\_cpu\_get() has been
called for it too. To balance that cpufreq\_cpu\_get(), we need to
call cpufreq\_cpu\_put() in that case.
Thus, to fix the described problem and keep the reference
counters balanced in both cases, move the cpufreq\_cpu\_get() call
in \_\_cpufreq\_remove\_dev() to the code path executed only for
CPUs that share the policy with other CPUs.

Revert "cpuidle: Quickly notice prediction failure in general case"
commit 228b30234f258a193317874854eee1ca7807186e upstream.
Revert commit e11538d1 (cpuidle: Quickly notice prediction failure in
general case), since it depends on commit 69a37be (cpuidle: Quickly
notice prediction failure for repeat mode) that has been identified
as the source of a significant performance regression in v3.8 and
later.

ACPI / battery: Fix parsing \_BIX return value
commit 016d5baad04269e8559332df05f89bd95b52d6ad upstream.
The \_BIX method returns extended battery info as a package.
According the ACPI spec (ACPI 5, Section 10.2.2.2), the first member
of that package should be "Revision". However, the current ACPI
battery driver treats the first member as "Power Unit" which should
be the second member. This causes the result of \_BIX return data
parsing to be incorrect.
Fix this by adding a new member called 'revision' to struct
acpi\_battery and adding the offsetof() information on it to
extended\_info\_offsets[] as the first row.

zram: protect sysfs handler from invalid memory access
commit 5863e10b441e7ea4b492f930f1be180a97d026f3 upstream.
Use zram->init\_lock to protect access to zram->meta, otherwise it
may cause invalid memory access if zram->meta has been freed by
zram\_reset\_device().
This issue may be triggered by:

zram: avoid access beyond the zram device
commit 12a7ad3b810e77137d0caf97a6dd97591e075b30 upstream.
Function valid\_io\_request() should verify the entire request are within
the zram device address range. Otherwise it may cause invalid memory
access when accessing/modifying zram->meta->table[index] because the
'index' is out of range. Then it may access non-exist memory, randomly

zram: use zram->lock to protect zram\_free\_page() in swap free notify path
commit 57ab048532c0d975538cebd4456491b5c34248f4 upstream.
zram\_slot\_free\_notify() is free-running without any protection from
concurrent operations. So there are race conditions between
zram\_bvec\_read()/zram\_bvec\_write() and zram\_slot\_free\_notify(),
and possible consequences include:
1) Trigger BUG\_ON(!handle) on zram\_bvec\_write() side.
2) Access to freed pages on zram\_bvec\_read() side.
3) Break some fields (bad\_compress, good\_compress, pages\_stored)
in zram->stats if the swap layer makes concurrently call to
zram\_slot\_free\_notify().
So enhance zram\_slot\_free\_notify() to acquire writer lock on zram->lock
before calling zram\_free\_page().

zram: avoid invalid memory access in zram\_exit()
commit 6030ea9b35971a4200062f010341ab832e878ac9 upstream.
Memory for zram->disk object may have already been freed after returning
from destroy\_device(zram), then it's unsafe for zram\_reset\_device(zram)
to access zram->disk again.
We can't solve this bug by flipping the order of destroy\_device(zram)
and zram\_reset\_device(zram), that will cause deadlock issues to the
zram sysfs handler.
So fix it by holding an extra reference to zram->disk before calling
destroy\_device(zram).

This patch fixes an issue wherein association would fail on P2P
interfaces. This happened because we are checking priv->mode
against NL80211\_IFTYPE\_STATION. While this check is correct for
infrastructure stations, it would fail P2P clients for which mode
is NL80211\_IFTYPE\_P2P\_CLIENT.
Better check would be bss\_role which has only 2 values: STA/AP.

rt2x00: fix stop queue
commit e2288b66fe7ff0288382b2af671b4da558b44472 upstream.
Since we clear QUEUE\_STARTED in rt2x00queue\_stop\_queue(), following
call to rt2x00queue\_pause\_queue() reduce to noop, i.e we do not
stop queue in mac80211.
To fix that introduce rt2x00queue\_pause\_queue\_nocheck() function,
which will stop queue in mac80211 directly.
Note that rt2x00\_start\_queue() explicitly set QUEUE\_PAUSED bit.
Note also that reordering operations i.e. first call to
rt2x00queue\_pause\_queue() and then clear QUEUE\_STARTED bit, will race
with rt2x00queue\_unpause\_queue(), so calling ieee80211\_stop\_queue()
directly is the only available solution to fix the problem without
major rework.

Bluetooth: fix wrong use of PTR\_ERR() in btusb
commit d9c78e9738ccd0017b10b8f44462aafb61904a4a upstream.
PTR\_ERR() returns a signed long type value which is limited by IS\_ERR(),
it must be a negative number whose range is [-MAX\_ERRNO, 0).
The bug here returns negative numbers as error codes, then check it by
"if (ret < 0)", but -PTR\_ERR() is actually positive. The wrong use here
leads to failure as below, even panic.

As reported in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=60514,
the station loop never initialises 'sinfo' and therefore adds up
a stack values, leaking stack information (the number of times it
adds values is easily obtained another way.)
Fix this by initialising the sinfo for each station to add.

mac80211: fix duplicate retransmission detection
commit 6b0f32745dcfba01d7be33acd1b40306c7a914c6 upstream.
The duplicate retransmission detection code in mac80211
erroneously attempts to do the check for every frame,
even frames that don't have a sequence control field or
that don't use it (QoS-Null frames.)
This is problematic because it causes the code to access
data beyond the end of the SKB and depending on the data
there will drop packets erroneously.
Correct the code to not do duplicate detection for such
frames.
I found this error while testing AP powersave, it lead
to retransmitted PS-Poll frames being dropped entirely
as the data beyond the end of the SKB was always zero.

serial/mxs-auart: increase time to wait for transmitter to become idle
commit 079a036f4283e2b0e5c26080b8c5112bc0cc1831 upstream.
Without this patch the driver waits ~1 ms for the UART to become idle. At
115200n8 this time is (theoretically) enough to transfer 11.5 characters
(= 115200 bits/s / (10 Bits/char) \* 1ms). As the mxs-auart has a fifo size
of 16 characters the clock is gated too early. The problem is worse for
lower baud rates.
This only happens to really shut down the transmitter in the middle of a
transfer if /dev/ttyAPPx isn't opened in userspace (e.g. by a getty) but
was at least once (because the bootloader doesn't disable the transmitter).
So increase the timeout to 20 ms which should be enough for 9600n8, too.
Moreover skip gating the clock if the timeout is elapsed.

ALSA: hda - Fix missing fixup for Mac Mini with STAC9221
commit 697aebab78a88c6b164cfb74d19b86817d2ccd82 upstream.
A fixup for Apple Mac Mini was lost during the adaption to the generic
parser because the fallback for the generic ID 8384:7680 was dropped,
and it resulted in the silence output (and maybe other problems).
Unfortunately, just adding the missing subsystem ID wasn't enough, in
this case. The subsystem ID of this machine is 0000:0100 (what Apple
thought...?), and since snd\_hda\_pick\_fixup() doesn't take the vendor
id zero into account, the driver ignored this entry. Now it's fixed
to regard the vendor id zero as a valid value.

commit dd5e6d6a3db09b16b7c222943977865eead88cc3 upstream.
We can't use dev->mod\_index for selecting the interrupt routing entry,
because it's not an index into interrupt routing table. It will be even
wrong on a machine with 2 CPUs (4 cores). But all needed information is
contained in the PAT entries for the serial ports. mod[0] contains the
iosapic address and mod\_info has some indications for the interrupt
input (at least it looks like it). This patch implements the searching
for the right iosapic and uses this interrupt input information.

pfn\_valid() is false, there is no "struct page" backing. Otherwise, they
are treated as normal pages.
The FireGL driver uses the VM\_MIXEDMAP without a backing "struct page".
This treatment caused a panic due to a TLB data miss in
update\_mmu\_cache. This appeared to be in the code generated for
page\_address(). We were in fact using a very circular bit of code to
determine the physical address of the PFN in various cache routines.
This wasn't valid when there was no "struct page" backing. The needed
address can in fact be determined simply from the PFN itself without
using the "struct page".
The attached patch updates update\_mmu\_cache(), flush\_cache\_mm(),
flush\_cache\_range() and flush\_cache\_page() to check pfn\_valid() and to
directly compute the PFN physical and virtual addresses.

parisc: agp/parisc-agp: allow binding of user memory to the AGP GART
commit 06f0cce43a32bd2357cea1d8733bba48693d556b upstream.
Allow binding of user memory to the AGP GART on systems with HP
Quicksilver AGP bus. This resolves 'bind memory failed' error seen in
dmesg:
[29.365973] [TTM] AGP Bind memory failed.

The system doesn't more fail to bind the memory, and hence not falling
back to the PCI mode (if other failures aren't detected).

powerpc: VPHN topology change updates all siblings
commit 3be7db6ab45b21345386d1a466da133b19cde5e4 upstream.
When an associativity level change is found for one thread, the
siblings threads need to be updated as well. This is done today
for PRRN in stage\_topology\_update() but is missing for VPHN in
update\_cpu\_associativity\_changes\_mask(). This patch will correctly
update all thread siblings during a topology change.
Without this patch a topology update can result in a CPU in
init\_sched\_groups\_power() getting stuck indefinitely in a loop.
This loop is built in build\_sched\_groups(). As a result of the thread
moving to a node separate from its siblings the struct sched\_group will
have its next pointer set to point to itself rather than the sched\_group
struct of the next thread. This happens because we have a domain without
the SD\_OVERLAP flag, which is correct, and a topology that doesn't conform
with reality (threads on the same core assigned to different numa nodes).
When this list is traversed by init\_sched\_groups\_power() it will reach
the thread's sched\_group structure and loop indefinitely; the cpu will
be stuck at this point.
The bug was exposed when VPHN was enabled in commit b7abef0 (v3.9).

ARM: 7791/1: a.out: remove partial a.out support
commit acfdd4b1f7590d02e9bae3b73bdbbc4a31b05d38 upstream.
a.out support on ARM requires that argc, argv and envp are passed in
r0-r2 respectively, which requires hacking load\_aout\_binary to
prevent argc being clobbered by the return code. Whilst mainline kernels
do set the registers up in start\_thread, the aout loader has never
carried the hack in mainline.
Initialising the registers in this way actually goes against the libc
expectations for ELF binaries, where argc, argv and envp are passed on
the stack, with r0 being used to hold a pointer to an exit function for
cleaning up after the dynamic linker if required. If the pointer is
NULL, then it is ignored. When execing an ELF binary, Linux currently
zeroes r0, then sets it to argc and then finally clobbers it with the
return value of the execve syscall, so we actually end up with:
r0 = 0
stack[0] = argc
r1 = stack[1] = argv
r2 = stack[2] = envp
libc treats r1 and r2 as undefined. The clobbering of r0 by sys\_execve
works for user-spawned threads, but when executing an ELF binary from a
kernel thread (via call\_usermodehelper), the execve is performed on the
ret\_from\_fork path, which restores r0 from the saved pt\_regs, resulting
in argc being presented to the C library. This has horrible consequences
when the application exits, since we have an exit function registered
using argc, resulting in a jump to hyperspace.
This patch solves the problem by removing the partial a.out support from
arch/arm/ altogether.

ARM: 7790/1: Fix deferred mm switch on VIVT processors
commit bdae73cd374e28db544fdd9b77de689a36e3c129 upstream.
As of commit b9d4d42ad9 (ARM: Remove \_\_ARCH\_WANT\_INTERRUPTS\_ON\_CTXSW on
pre-ARMv6 CPUs), the mm switching on VIVT processors is done in the
finish\_arch\_post\_lock\_switch() function to avoid whole cache flushing
with interrupts disabled. The need for deferred mm switch is stored as a
thread flag (TIF\_SWITCH\_MM). However, with preemption enabled, we can
have another thread switch before finish\_arch\_post\_lock\_switch(). If the
new thread has the same mm as the previous 'next' thread, the scheduler
will not call switch\_mm() and the TIF\_SWITCH\_MM flag won't be set for
the new thread.
This patch moves the switch pending flag to the mm\_context\_t structure
since this is specific to the mm rather than thread.

ARM: 7784/1: mm: ensure SMP alternates assemble to exactly 4 bytes with Thumb-2
commit bf3f0f332f76a85ff3a0b393aaded5a8533769c0 upstream.
Commit ae8a8b9553bd ("ARM: 7691/1: mm: kill unused TLB\_CAN\_READ\_FROM\_L1\_CACHE
and use ALT\_SMP instead") added early function returns for page table
cache flushing operations on ARMv7 SMP CPUs.
Unfortunately, when targetting Thumb-2, these `mov pc, lr' sequences
assemble to 2 bytes which can lead to corruption of the instruction
stream after code patching.
This patch fixes the alternates to use wide (32-bit) instructions for
Thumb-2, therefore ensuring that the patching code works correctly.

powerpc/windfarm: Fix noisy slots-fan on Xserve (rm31)
commit fe956a1d4081ce1a959f87df397a15e252201f10 upstream.
slots-fan on G5 Xserve is always running at full speed with windfarm\_rm31
driver, resulting in a very high acoustic noise level. It seems the fan
parameters are incorrect, and have been copied from the Drive Bay fan
(RPM, not present on rm31) of the legacy therm\_pm72 driver. This patch
changes the parameters to match the Slots fan (PWM) of therm\_pm72. With
the patch, slots-fan speed drops from 99% to 19% during normal use,
and slots-temp settle to ~42'C.

# USN-1971-1: Linux kernel (Raring HWE) vulnerabilities

27 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-raring](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-raring) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Raring

## Details

Vince Weaver discovered a flaw in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel on

ARM platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4254](/security/CVE-2013-4254))

A memory leak was discovered in the user namespace facility of the Linux

kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (memory consumption)

via the CLONE\_NEWUSER unshare call. ([CVE-2013-4205](/security/CVE-2013-4205))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-31-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-31.46~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-31.46~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
