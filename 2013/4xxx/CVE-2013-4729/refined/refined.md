Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `import.php` script in phpMyAdmin was susceptible to a global variable scope injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Global Variable Injection:** The script did not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary values into global variables. This could overwrite existing variables, including configuration parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Configuration Manipulation:** By injecting malicious values into global variables, an attacker could alter phpMyAdmin's configuration settings. This could lead to various severe consequences, potentially including:
    - Unauthorized access to the database server.
    - Data breaches and exfiltration.
    - Denial of service attacks.
    - Further exploitation of the server and system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability could be exploited via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `import.php` script. The malicious data would likely target the form parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of phpMyAdmin. The token protection prevents non-logged-in users from directly accessing the vulnerable form.
- **Knowledge of phpMyAdmin Configuration Parameters**: The attacker needs to know the phpMyAdmin's configuration parameters in order to overwrite them.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2013-4729 and is associated with CWE-621 and CWE-661.
- The vulnerability was fixed in phpMyAdmin version 4.0.4.1. The fix included checking the format parameter and using a `post_patterns` array.
- The vulnerability was reported by Markus Wulftange of Daimler TSS.
- The provided commit `012464268420e53a9cd81cbb4a43988d70393c36` addresses this vulnerability.
