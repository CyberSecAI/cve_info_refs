- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in HP System Management Homepage due to a malformed request using the `iprange` parameter in `/proxy/DataValidation`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by crashing a listener child process, overwriting EIP, and corrupting the stack.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a malformed request to the listener service via the `/proxy/DataValidation` endpoint, using the `iprange` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the listener service without authentication (anonymous access).
