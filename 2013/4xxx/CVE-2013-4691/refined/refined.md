- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `connect.methodOverride()` middleware overwrites `req.method` with the value of `req.body['_method']`. When an error occurs that is not properly handled, the application responds with a default error message that includes the unsanitized `req.method` and `req.originalUrl` values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The error message includes user-controlled input (`req.method`) that is not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML response, which allows injection of malicious JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the error page, which will then execute in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a request with a `_method` parameter in the body containing the malicious JavaScript, which will be reflected in the error response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server. The server also must be using the vulnerable `connect.methodOverride()` middleware and not properly handle specific errors to trigger the vulnerable code path.
