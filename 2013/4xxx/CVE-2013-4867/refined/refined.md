{
  "CVE-2013-4867": {
    "Root cause": "Python module hijacking during the setup process of the Karotz device.",
    "Weaknesses": "The Karotz device's autorunwifi script loads modules from the same directory as the script, making it vulnerable to module hijacking.",
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary Python code by placing a malicious module (e.g., simplejson.py) in the same directory as the autorunwifi script. This allows for arbitrary code execution and potential extraction of sensitive information like the decryption key for the root filesystem.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs physical access to the Karotz device and must insert a USB flash drive containing the malicious module and the autorunwifi script.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to physically plug a USB drive into the Karotz device and power cycle the device."
