Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-4997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in multiple parts of the phpMyAdmin application. Specifically:
    - Unescaped JavaScript event handlers in crafted URL hashes.
    - Unescaped HTML in chart titles.
    - Unescaped query parameters in server status monitor.
    - Unescaped logo URLs
    - Unescaped input from ajax validation

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist. These include:
    - Reflected XSS in `setup/index.php` using a crafted # hash with a JavaScript event.
    - Reflected XSS in chart display view via an unescaped HTML title.
    - Stored XSS in server status monitor through unescaped query parameters.
    - Stored XSS through malicious logo link in navigation sidebar.
    - Reflected XSS in setup through unescaped input from ajax validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking/stealing cookies.
    - Defacement of the phpMyAdmin interface.
    - Phishing attacks.
    - Other malicious activities depending on the attacker's payload.

**Attack Vectors:**
    - Crafted URL hash values with JavaScript events in `setup/index.php`.
    - Embedding HTML tags in a chart title
    - Creating databases or users with HTML tags in their name and then issuing a sleep query
    - Configuring a malicious URL for the phpMyAdmin logo link.
    - Inputting arbitrary HTML code into the setup field for "List of trusted proxies for IP allow/deny."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - For the reflected XSS vulnerabilities:
       - The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a phpMyAdmin user into clicking it.
   - For the stored XSS vulnerabilities:
       - The attacker needs to be logged into phpMyAdmin with permissions to create database or users.
       - The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the phpMyAdmin logo link.
       - For the setup vulnerability, the attacker needs to be logged in to phpMyAdmin and able to access the setup page.

**Additional Notes:**
    - The severity is considered "non critical" due to the fact that a user must be logged in to phpMyAdmin for the stored XSS attacks to be successful.
    - The setup vulnerabilities require user interaction and crafted input values.
    - The issue is fixed in phpMyAdmin versions 3.5.8.2, 4.0.4.2 or newer.
    - The content also lists CVE-2013-4996 as part of the same security announcement PMASA-2013-9
