- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Huawei Access Router (AR) fails to properly parse a special field present in DHCP request packets from certain IP phones. This failure leads to an anomaly, causing the AR to reset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper parsing of specific fields within DHCP request packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause the AR to reset, leading to network paralysis (denial of service).
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted DHCP request packets to the AR.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the LAN and able to send DHCP packets to the AR acting as a DHCP server. They may need knowledge of the special field used by specific IP phones.
