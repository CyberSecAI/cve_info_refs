The provided content is related to CVE-2013-4806 as it is the same vulnerability described under the CVE ID CVE-2013-0149 (which is referenced in this document as well), just with a different identifier.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The OSPF protocol does not specify that the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields need to match when a router receives an OSPF Link State Advertisement (LSA). During the routing table calculation, a LSA is queried using only the Link State ID. This allows an attacker to inject a malformed duplicate entry with a false Link State ID, potentially subverting the routing table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier (CWE-694): The OSPF protocol uses the Link State ID as a non-unique identifier when querying LSAs.
- Lack of proper validation/matching of 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields in OSPF LSAs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Traffic re-routing, allowing the attacker to intercept or redirect network traffic, thus compromising confidentiality.
- Denial of service (DoS) attack by dropping the entire routing table, causing service disruption.
- Arbitrary poisoning of the routing tables of other routers in the Autonomous System (AS) leading to traffic subversion or black hole attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted illegal OSPF router LSAs (type-1) where the link state ID and router ID do not match.
- Spoofing a legitimate OSPF peer to send the crafted LSA.
- Sending crafted router LSAs to an interface where an OSPF peer is already present.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control of a router within the same Autonomous System (AS).
- The attacker needs to be able to send OSPF link-state update (LSU) packets to an OSPF interface of the victim router.
- The OSPF interface of the targeted router should not be using MD5 authentication.
- Access list or firewall filters on physical interfaces should not limit access to the router via OSPF.
