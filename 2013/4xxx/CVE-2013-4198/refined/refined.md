Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the Plone content management system's password change mechanism. Specifically, the system failed to properly restrict password changes for users who were explicitly prohibited from doing so by policy settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is that Plone did not enforce its own password policy correctly.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The "forgotten password" functionality could be used to bypass restrictions on password changes for unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An authenticated user could alter their password despite policy settings disallowing it.
*   This could lead to security policy violations within the Plone system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An authenticated Plone user could use the "forgotten password" functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user within the Plone system.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was located in the `mail_password.py` script.
* Red Hat's Bugzilla entry for this CVE indicates that it was closed with a "WONTFIX" status, implying the issue may not be directly addressed in the affected version.
* This vulnerability allows a user to bypass password policy restrictions, but it is not a method to bypass authentication.
