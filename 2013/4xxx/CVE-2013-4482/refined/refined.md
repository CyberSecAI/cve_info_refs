{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The luci service uses python-paste-script/paster to start its web application. Paster searches the current working directory (CWD) and parent directories for Python *.egg-info files or directories. These are used to define additional commands or add paths to sys.path. Luci failed to force a safe CWD, thus if started from an untrusted directory, a local user with write access to that directory could inject code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of current working directory during service initialization.",
      "Dependency on untrusted files in the CWD and parent directories due to paster."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the luci service (root or luci user).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user with write access to the directory from which the luci service is started."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local write access to the directory from which the luci service is started. The system administrator needs to start the service from an untrusted, writable directory such as /tmp."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "fix_details": "The service init script was changed to set current working directory to a safe location before starting luci.",
