Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in LightDM's incorrect application of the AppArmor security profile when a guest session is initiated. Specifically, the guest session was no longer being run through the intended wrapper, which enforces the AppArmor profile.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Guest Wrapper:** LightDM's configuration change in version 1.7.5 made the guest wrapper configurable, but the Ubuntu package was not setting it, meaning the guest session was launched without the intended AppArmor confinement.
*   **Incorrect Configuration:** The `create_guest_session()` function in `seat.c` was using the general `session-wrapper` config instead of the specific `lightdm-guest-session-wrapper`.
*   **Lack of DBus Permissions:** The AppArmor profile for the guest account was not correctly adjusted for DBus communications which are needed to run a desktop environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the intended AppArmor restrictions for guest sessions.
*   **Access to Home Directories:** Guest users could gain unauthorized read access to other users' home directories, which they should not be able to access.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** The vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to gain further unauthorized access or privileges if the guest session is not adequately confined.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have physical or remote access to the system where LightDM is running.
*   **Guest Session Initiation:** The attacker would initiate a guest session through the LightDM login screen, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to log in to the system, either physically or remotely.
*   **Basic User Privileges:** The attacker does not need any special user privileges other than the ability to log in as a guest.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the AppArmor profile is not being properly applied to the guest session.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was fixed by re-enabling the guest wrapper functionality in LightDM and updating the AppArmor profile with appropriate DBus access.
*   The fix was implemented in LightDM versions 1.8.4 and 1.9.2.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2013-4459.
*   The `disable-guest-wrapper` configuration option was removed.
*   The fix also involved adding a configuration file to `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d` to set the guest session wrapper to `/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm/lightdm-greeter-session`.
