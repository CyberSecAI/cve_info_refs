- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Gemini JPEG encoder and the Jpeg1.0 common encoder/decoder engines of the camera driver do not properly initialize all members of a structure before copying it to user space.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure due to uninitialized memory. Specifically, the vulnerability is categorized as CWE-200 (information exposure).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via ioctl system calls to the camera driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the device nodes to interact with the camera driver through ioctl calls.
