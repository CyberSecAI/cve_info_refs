  "CVE-2013-4497": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack Nova. When migrating or resizing an instance, including live migration, existing security groups may not be reapplied after the operation completes. This can lead to unintentional network exposure for virtual machines. Only setups using the XenAPI backend are affected.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The XenAPI backend in OpenStack Nova was missing code to reapply security group rules after a VM migration or resize operation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incomplete security group enforcement during VM migration and resize.",
	"Missing code in finish_migration() to apply security group rules"
      ],
      "impact": "Unintentional network exposure for virtual machines due to missing security group enforcement after migration or resize. This could allow unauthorized access to the VM.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Performing a VM migration or resize operation using OpenStack Nova's XenAPI backend"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with the ability to trigger a VM migration or resize operation within the OpenStack environment."

      "fix_description": "The fix ensures that security groups are re-applied to the VM once it reached the destination and been started. This leaves a small amount of time during live-migration where the VM is not protected. There is a further bug raised to close the rest of this hole.",

     "The vulnerability affects both migration and live-migration.",
