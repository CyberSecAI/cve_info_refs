- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web management application fails to restrict URL access to certain areas. Specifically, accessing the `/filesystem/` URL causes a denial-of-service condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to insufficient access control on the web management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a switch reboot or crash, causing a loss of network connectivity for all devices connected to the switch.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a simple HTTP GET request to the affected switch's web management interface at the `/filesystem/` URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs network access to the affected switch's web management interface. Authentication is not required.
