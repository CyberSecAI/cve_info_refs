CVE-2013-4775: Unauthenticated startup-config disclosure
The web management application fails to restrict URL access to different application areas.
Remote, unauthenticated attackers could exploit this issue to download the device’s startup-
config, which contains administrator credentials in encrypted form.

Proof of Concept
The vulnerability can be exploited with a simple HTTP (GET) request.
Open a browser and visit http://Target-IP/filesystem/startup-config

CVE-2013-4776: Denial of Service vulnerability
The affected products are prone to a Denial of Service vulnerability. Remote, unauthenticated
attackers could exploit this issue to cause a switch reboot or crash, resulting in a loss of
network connectivity for all devices connected to the switch.

Proof of Concept
The vulnerability can be exploited with a simple HTTP (GET) request.
Open a browser and visit http://Target-IP/filesystem/
