#### Synopsis

A web application on the remote web server has multiple vulnerabilities.
#### Description

The version of AjaXplorer hosted on the remote web server is earlier than 5.0.1. It is, therefore, affected by multiple command execution vulnerabilities in the following plugins:

 - File System Standard Plugin (access.fs)
 - Power FS Plugin (action.powerfs)
 - Subversion Repository Plugin (meta.svn)

The plugins above are installed and enabled in the default installation except for the Power FS plugin, which is installed but not enabled by default.
#### Solution

Upgrade to AjaXplorer version 5.0.1 or later.
