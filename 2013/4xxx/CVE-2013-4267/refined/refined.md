Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-4267:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **inadequate sanitization** of user-controlled input before passing it to shell commands, specifically through the `popen()`, backticks (` `), and `system()` functions in PHP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided data, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands. This is a classic example of CWE-78.
*   The following plugins were affected:
    *   **"Power FS" (action.powerfs):** The `archive_name` variable is directly used in a `zip` command executed with `popen()`.
    *   **"File System (Standard)" (access.fs):** The `file` variable is used within `stat`, `ls -1s` and `ls -l` commands executed using backticks.
    *   **"Subversion Repository" (meta.svn):** The `revision` parameter is used in `svn cat` command within a system call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable application, allowing them to gain control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of the AjaXplorer application. The vulnerabilities are present in specific functionalities of the application's plugins.
*   For the "Power FS" plugin, the attacker needs to select files, choose compress, and insert the malicious command into the archive name.
*   For the "File System (Standard)" plugin, the attacker needs to create or rename a file and insert the malicious command into the name.
*  For the "Subversion Repository" plugin, the attacker needs to send a forged `revert_file` request with malicious `revision` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with sufficient privileges to access the affected functionalities in AjaXplorer.
*   The "Power FS" plugin does not need to be enabled by default, but can be enabled via the web interface.
*   The "Real Size Probing" option in the "File System (Standard)" plugin needs to be enabled, which is set to No by default.
*   The "Subversion Repository" plugin must be enabled and an SVN repository present.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided patch uses `escapeshellarg()` to sanitize user input before passing it to shell commands.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in AjaXplorer version 5.0.1.
