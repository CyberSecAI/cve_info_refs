The provided content includes a technical report that describes a vulnerability in the way Apple iOS generates default passwords for mobile hotspots. The vulnerability allows attackers to easily compromise iOS hotspots.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The default passwords generated by Apple iOS for mobile hotspots are based on a limited word list, which is combined with a four-digit number. The process of word selection is not random, resulting in a skewed frequency distribution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Weak Default Passwords:** iOS uses a small word list (1,842 entries) and a non-random selection process for generating default hotspot passwords.
- **Predictable Password Structure:** The passwords consist of a 4-6 character word from the list followed by a 4 digit number.
- **Skewed Frequency Distribution:** Some words are much more likely to be chosen than others.
- **No Password Complexity Enforcement:** The generated passwords are not complex, making them susceptible to brute force and dictionary attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Internet Access:** An attacker can gain access to the victim's internet connection.
- **Abuse of Data Plan:** An attacker could use the victim's data plan, potentially incurring extra charges or reducing the victim's bandwidth.
- **Access to Exposed Services:** The attacker can potentially access services running on the smart device, including file-sharing services or system services with default credentials.
- **Attacks on Connected Devices:** The attacker can potentially attack other devices connected to the compromised hotspot.
- **Eavesdropping:** The attacker can intercept communications between the mobile hotspot and connected devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Brute Force Attack:** An attacker captures the WPA2 handshake between a device and the hotspot, then uses brute-force or dictionary attacks to crack the password.
- **Dictionary Attack:** The attacker uses a pre-generated wordlist to attempt to crack the WPA2 PSK

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the mobile hotspot.
- **Packet Capturing:** The attacker needs to be able to capture the WPA2 4-way handshake.
- **Computational Resources:** The attacker needs sufficient computational resources (e.g., GPU cluster) to perform the password cracking process.
- **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs knowledge of network security and password cracking techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- The report details the reverse engineering process used to identify the word list and password generation method.
- The report highlights that the selection of words is not random with some words used much more often than others
- The report details the time needed to crack passwords using different hardware setups. A GPU cluster can crack an iOS hotspot default password in less than 50 seconds.
- The report mentions the creation of an app called "Hotspot Cracker" which automates some aspects of the attack.
- The report notes that other platforms may be affected by similar issues.
