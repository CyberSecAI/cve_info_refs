| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=314919#c0)  Sander Lepik    2013-02-11 17:37:17 UTC  ``` Blinking systray icons are causing X to leak memory and plasma-desktop is to blame:  uptime: 23h xrestop: res-base Wins  GCs Fnts Pxms Misc   Pxm mem  Other   Total   PID Identifier     2600000    64   63    0   87       54789   103910K   1287K 105197K  4300 plasma-desktop  In less than 24h it's using 100+ MB memory and the icon wasn't blinking most of the time. When the icon is not blinking then the used memory stays the same. As soon as icon starts to blink the memory usage in X also starts to grow.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start some application ((he)xchat for example) that has blinking systray icon. 2. Make the icon blink 3. Watch plasma-desktop memory usage in xrestop. Actual Results:   Memory starts to leak.  Expected Results:   X memory shouldn't leak.  I'm using nvidia driver and desktop effects are enabled (OpenGL). ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=314919#c1)  Sander Lepik    2013-03-05 15:27:44 UTC  ``` After few days X will be really slow and plasma-desktop crashes sometimes. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=314919#c2)  Mark Rogers    2013-04-04 11:35:38 UTC  ``` I am also affected by this. Eventually I find that /usr/bin/X CPU usage risesover a period of hours to ~100% and the whole system becomes unusable. Stopping whatever is causing the icon to animate causes CPU to return to ~0%, restarting the icon animation sends CPU back to 100%.  My scenario is with Dropbox: during synchronisation it animates between two icons indicating that the sync is in progress. If the sync fails (eg a file is unreadable) Dropbox continues to animate the icons forever, resulting in the continued memory loss and eventual high X CPU usage. Eg, with Dropbox installed (with ~/Dropbox as the Dropbox sync folder):  # Create file as root, Dropbox will sync it fine as it can still read it sudo touch ~/Dropbox/test.txt # Change permissions to prevent reads, Dropbox will animate forever sudo chmod 600 ~/Dropbox/test.txt # Monitor with xrestop to confirm memory leak. When X CPU reaches high levels, confirm that sudo chmod 644 ~/Dropbox/test.txt # .. allows CPU to drop, and  sudo chmod 600 ~/Dropbox/test.txt # .. sends CPU back off into space. Finally sudo rm ~/Dropbox/test.txt # .. to get your system back.  Note that in my case I had to leave the system running for upwards of 48hrs to really see the dramatic slowdown, although memory leakage is evident via xrestop immediately.  See also: <https://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=98835> <http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=110294>  I initially had this problem with KDE as shipped with Kubuntu 12.10 with onboard AMD graphics (FOSS drivers). Before narrowing the problem down I upgraded to Kubuntu 13.04 (beta), installed an nVidia G210 graphics card (first FOSS then proprietary drivers). All gave me the same symptoms so I don't think this is related to a graphics driver or specific hardware. My PC has 16GB RAM and never goes above about 8GB used even when the system has ground to a halt with X CPU usage at 100%.  In case this helps (probably not!): The Dropbox animation uses files from ~/.dropbox-dist/images/hicolor/16x16/status/. Removing one of the busy icons (eg dropboxstatus-busy2.png) and restarting dropbox (dropbox stop/dropbox start) generates the following exceptions: ---- Traceback (most recent call last):   File "arch/linux/tray_icon_wx.py", line 134, in busy_tick   File "wx/_windows.py", line 1657, in SetIcon wx._core.PyAssertionError: C++ assertion "Ok()" failed at ./src/gtk/bitmap.cpp(876) in GetPixbuf(): invalid bitmap ---- Triggering the sync issue (chmod 600 as above) results in the same exception repeatedly as the icons are animated. xrestop indicates that the memory leak is continuing to leak. However removing both of the busy icons and restarting Dropbox does not generate an exception and xrestop reports no memory loss when the sync issue is triggered.  I only mention this in case it indicates a problem in wx rather than plasma-desktop. I don't know whether the other apps that trigger this are also wx based. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=314919#c3)  Jekyll Wu    2013-04-07 02:19:16 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 317961](show_bug.cgi?id=317961 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - GTK apps in system tray leak X resources") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=314919#c4)  Eevee    2013-04-07 04:11:21 UTC  ``` Discoveries I reported in [bug 317961](show_bug.cgi?id=317961 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - GTK apps in system tray leak X resources"):  - This has been around a long time; at least a year. - It's not specifically blinking.  Any icon change leaks the old icon. - KDE apps don't seem to be affected.  I've observed the leak it in Pidgin, uim-toolbar-gtk-systray, and WhatPulse; other reports mention X-Chat derivatives, Dropbox, and VMWare.  All of these are GTK+ applications. - Use of desktop effects is irrelevant.  Suspect video card and drivers are, too; anyone with a non-nvidia card is welcome to prove me wrong. - Setting all GTK+ systray icons to Hidden, disabling their systray icons, or removing the system tray plasmoid all prevent further leaking. - `killall plasma-desktop && plasma-desktop` has been the simplest way I've found to reset the picture count and unsuck the desktop. - The most accessible way to reproduce is to run Pidgin, sign in, turn on its systray icon, and change status a few times.

I'm on KDE 4.10.1, kernel 3.7.10, knutclient 1.0.4, xorg-drivers 1.13, xf86-video-ati 7.0.0, mesa 9.0.1, with Gentoo as the distro.  I do not see this behavior with some other apps (e.g. vlc 2.0.5)  Another oddity, to reset the file-nr value back to "normal", I could logout/login to KDE, though when I do this, a later reboot via kexec (2.0.2) results in a kernel crash early in the boot process.  A reboot via kexec from the first login to KDE does not result in a kernel crash on boot. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=314919#c9)  Michael Lashkevich    2013-04-30 20:51:52 UTC  ``` I confirm the bug (OpenSUSE 12.3, xf86-video-intel, kde 4.10.2).

I think I got a new trigger to get it appear in a very reliable way.  Scenario: - ensure you have at least 2-3 icons hidden in the systray "Show hidden icons" (the up arrow before the hour) - open a konsole and run a xrestop into it. ensure this window is viewable, - click on the up arrow in the systray and slide between icons using your mouse (go up and down for a while)  Obervsations: - if you stop moving the mouse over hidden icons, the misc pixmaps count is somehow stable in xrestop for plasma-desktop. - if you move the mouse between icons, then the misc pixmap count is constantly increasing.  My 50 cents. Topaz ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=314919#c19)  yjcoshc    2013-06-26 03:36:44 UTC  ``` It seems that it has multiple memory leaks: 1.Blinking icons in the tray. 2.Show/Hidden calendar/kickoff.(While the calendar shows up, the pixmem usage increases, but it doesn't decrease when it is hidden.) 3.Switch windows.(I switch between firefox and konsole and each time the pixmem usage grows about 4K and never decreases.) ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=314919#c20)  mathew    2013-06-26 14:51:40 UTC  ``` I get chronic memory leakage in X which in my case seems to be something to do with Google Chrome and/or VMware Workstation — however, that could just be because those are the programs I leave running the longest. I too am using the nVidia proprietary driver.  Generally if I quit Chrome and VMware completely I can ameliorate the situation, but eventually X.org starts chewing 100% CPU and the only option is to restart.  Right now, running xrestop, plasma-desktop has 207620 in the Misc column, and it's increasing by 3 points every couple of seconds, even if I just sit and watch it. It certainly looks to me like there's a leak in plasma-desktop.  I'd love to help track down the bug, if there's anything I can do.  Kubuntu 12.04 LTS, plasma-desktop 4.10.4 via Ubuntu PPA.  Now at 207946... ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=314919#c21)  mathew    2013-06-26 15:06:11 UTC  ``` Aha! If I stop my VMware image, the leakage stops. If I use VMware Player instead of VMware Workstation, no leakage. One key difference between the two is that VMware Workstation puts an icon in the system tray to indicate the running state of the VM.  So this supports the idea that it's something to do with systray icons changing. My guess is that VMware updates the icon every second or two even if it doesn't strictly need to.  And in the mean time, if I use VMware Player for my VMs, I can hopefully avoid having to reboot so often... ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=314919#c22)  Rael Gugelmin Cunha    2013-06-26 16:37:20 UTC  ``` Any relation with this bug?

It also appears that [bug 216289](show_bug.cgi?id=216289 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - kopete makes plasma use much CPU power") is assigned to the Kopete developers, which isn't the right group to handle this (as _any_ animated systray icon triggers the issue).

The scenario is as follows:  - At system startup (monitoring with htop) VIRT usage by kdeinit4: plasma-desktop is just about 3000MB. RES about 300MB, SHR about 100MB - Memory usage keeps increasing. After some hours, VIRT can reach up to 16GB(!) which leads to high swap usage. However, xrestop doesn't show any increments. - I've not been able to relate it to any particular application, but it seems that 'heavy' ones (like Eclipse) take a high toll on memory usage.

Hi Jan et al.

Actually, issue #1's fix (CVE-2013-4132) just missed the
tag/release
deadline for 4.10.5 by a day or two. The FIXED-IN entry in the
revision comment is inaccurate.

Distribs, when upgrading to kde-workspace 4.10.5, should apply
<https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kde->
workspace/repository/revisions/45b7f137fbc0b942fd2c9b4e8d8c1f0293e64
ba7.

Best,

--mancha
