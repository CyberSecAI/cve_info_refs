Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4132:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a potential NULL pointer dereference in KDM (K Display Manager) and KCheckPass. This occurs when the `crypt(3)` function, or similar functions, return a NULL value and the code doesn't properly check for it before dereferencing the pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of NULL return values from the `crypt(3)` function or similar password hashing functions.
- Lack of a check for a NULL pointer before dereferencing, leading to a potential crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition, by crashing the KDM or KCheckPass processes. This would prevent users from logging into their systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves conditions that can cause `crypt(3)` to return a NULL value. This might include using specific glibc versions, such as 2.17 (eglibc 2.17), or systems configured with FIPS mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position to trigger the login process using KDM. This may not require local access as some systems might have this accessible through network.
- The attacker would need to create an environment that results in the `crypt(3)` function to return a NULL value, likely via specially crafted inputs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check for NULL return values from `crypt(3)` and related functions before attempting to use the return value
- This issue was addressed in kde-workspace. The fix was not included in the 4.10.5 release, and distros are instructed to manually apply the fix.
