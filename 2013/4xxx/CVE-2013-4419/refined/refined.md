  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `guestfish` utility, when started in server mode using the `--listen` option, insecurely created the temporary directory used to store the network socket.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary directory creation",
      "Predictable socket name"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could intercept and modify other users' `guestfish` commands, potentially leading to arbitrary guestfish actions with the privileges of another user (e.g., modifying virtual machines) or obtaining authentication credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `guestfish` is running in server mode."
