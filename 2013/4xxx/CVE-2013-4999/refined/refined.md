Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from calling certain phpMyAdmin scripts in an unexpected manner. This triggers PHP error messages, which inadvertently reveal the full server path where phpMyAdmin is installed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** The core weakness is the exposure of the server's full file path through PHP error messages. This is a form of information disclosure.
- Improper error handling: The application does not handle errors properly, which leads to the exposure of sensitive information

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of the full path to the phpMyAdmin installation.
- This information could potentially be leveraged by attackers in further attacks. While this is not considered a critical vulnerability, such information can be helpful for attackers in reconnaissance and exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unexpected Script Calls:** Attackers can trigger this vulnerability by calling specific phpMyAdmin scripts in a way that the application doesn't expect, leading to the display of error messages containing the path. The specific method is not detailed

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to make HTTP requests to the phpMyAdmin instance.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable scripts/parameters:** The attacker must be able to identify which scripts and what conditions will lead to the path disclosure.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is considered non-critical because it is only exposed when the PHP configuration setting `display_errors` is set to `on`, which goes against the recommendations in the PHP manual.
- Affected versions include phpMyAdmin 3.5.x (prior to 3.5.8.2) and 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.4.2).
- The issue is addressed in phpMyAdmin versions 3.5.8.2 and 4.0.4.2 and later, or via the provided patches.
- The provided text also lists the assigned CWEs as CWE-661 and CWE-200 which aligns with the Full Path Disclosure vulnerability description.
