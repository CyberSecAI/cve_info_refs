Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) dissector of Wireshark. A malformed RDP packet can cause a crash in the dissector due to an unspecified flaw in the parsing logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Crash Vulnerability:** The RDP dissector is vulnerable to crashing when processing a specially crafted RDP packet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service condition, where Wireshark becomes unresponsive or terminates unexpectedly. This prevents users from analyzing network traffic effectively.
- **Resource Consumption:** The provided info indicates excessive CPU resource consumption, which can lead to DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed RDP packet onto the network, targeting a user analyzing the traffic with a vulnerable version of Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can create a malicious capture file containing a malformed RDP packet and convince a user to open this file with a vulnerable version of Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject network packets or create a malicious packet capture file. This could be achieved by being on the same network segment or convincing a victim to open a crafted file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specifically within the RDP dissector.
- This issue was resolved in Wireshark version 1.8.8.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Laurent Butti.
