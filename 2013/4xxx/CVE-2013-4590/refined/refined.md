Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. Specifically, application-provided XML files such as `context.xml`, `web.xml`, `*.jspx`, `*.tagx`, or `*.tld` were parsed without proper restrictions on external entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The vulnerability stems from Tomcat's improper handling of external entity declarations within XML documents. This allows an attacker to define and use external entities within these XML files, potentially leading to malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially obtain "Tomcat internals" information by exploiting the XXE vulnerability. This might include sensitive configuration details, server files, and other internal data.
- **Security Manager Bypass (in some configurations):** The vulnerability is more impactful in environments where untrusted applications are run with a Security Manager configured. A malicious web application could use the XXE vulnerability to access files and data that the Security Manager would normally restrict, potentially impacting other web applications deployed in the same Tomcat instance.
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could exfiltrate sensitive information by leveraging the ability to specify external entities pointing to internal files, leading to their retrieval and exfiltration.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Untrusted Web Applications:** The primary attack vector is through deploying a malicious web application to Tomcat, especially in environments with shared hosting.
- **Manipulated XML Files:** An attacker can exploit the flaw by crafting malicious `context.xml`, `web.xml`, `*.jspx`, `*.tagx`, or `*.tld` XML files. These manipulated files are processed by Tomcat.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to deploy applications:** Attackers need the ability to deploy a web application that contains or can generate malicious XML files to the affected Tomcat server.
- **Untrusted environment:** The vulnerability is primarily exploitable when Tomcat is running web applications from untrusted sources, like a shared hosting environment, where there might not be full control or trust on the applications deployed.
- **Knowledge of internal structure:** While not strictly required to exploit the vulnerability, knowledge of internal Tomcat file paths and structures would make attacks more targeted and effective.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Apache Tomcat versions 6.0.39, 7.0.50 and 8.0.0-RC10.
- The fix implemented by the Apache Tomcat team involves adding an option to the `Context` to control blocking of XML external entities during parsing of XML files. This blocking is enabled by default, especially when a security manager is in place.
- Patches were made available to the affected products.
