## Updated tomcat package fixes security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 03 Apr 2014

Modification date: 03 Apr 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2013-4286](CVE-2013-4286.html)
,
[CVE-2013-4322](CVE-2013-4322.html)
,
[CVE-2013-4590](CVE-2013-4590.html)

## Description

```
Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.47, when an HTTP connector or AJP connector
is used, does not properly handle certain inconsistent HTTP request
headers, which allows remote attackers to trigger incorrect identification
of a request's length and conduct request-smuggling attacks via (1)
multiple Content-Length headers or (2) a Content-Length header and a
"Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header (CVE-2013-4286).

Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.50 processes chunked transfer coding without
properly handling (1) a large total amount of chunked data or (2)
whitespace characters in an HTTP header value within a trailer field,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by streaming
data  (CVE-2013-4322).

Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.50 allows attackers to obtain "Tomcat
internals" information by leveraging the presence of an untrusted web
application with a context.xml, web.xml, *.jspx, *.tagx, or *.tld XML
document containing an external entity declaration in conjunction with an
entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue
(CVE-2013-4590).

### Apache Tomcat 8.x vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat® 8.x. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
version with a question mark.

**Note:** Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.

**Please note that Tomcat 8.0.x has reached
[end of life](tomcat-80-eol.html) and is no longer supported.
Vulnerabilities reported after June 2018 were not checked against the
8.0.x branch and will not be fixed. Users should upgrade to 8.5.x or
later to obtain security fixes.**

Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to
apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the
Apache Tomcat version that you are using. For Tomcat 8.5 those are
[`building.html`](/tomcat-8.5-doc/building.html) and
[`BUILDING.txt`](/tomcat-8.5-doc/BUILDING.txt).
Both files can be found in the `webapps/docs` subdirectory
of a binary distributive. You may also want to review the
[Security Considerations](/tomcat-8.5-doc/security-howto.html)
page in the documentation.

If you need help on building or configuring Tomcat or other help on
following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed
here, please send your questions to the public
[Tomcat Users mailing list](lists.html)

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other
unexpected behaviour that has [security
impact](security-impact.html), or if the descriptions here are incomplete,
please report them privately to the
[Tomcat Security Team](security.html). Thank you.

### 2024-02-19 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.99

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2024-23672](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23672)

It was possible for a WebSocket client to keep a WebSocket connection
open leading to increased resource consumption.

This was fixed with commit
[3631adb1](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/3631adb1342d8bbd8598802a12b63ad02c37d591).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat Security Team on 17 January 2024.
The issue was made public on 13 March 2024.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.98

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2024-24549](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24549)

When processing an HTTP/2 request, if the request exceeded any of the
configured limits for headers, the associated HTTP/2 stream was not reset
until after all of the headers had been processed.

This was fixed with commit
[0cac540a](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/0cac540a882220231ba7a82330483cbd5f6b1f96).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 24 January 2024. The
issue was made public on 13 March 2024.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.98

### 2023-11-13 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.96

**Important: Request smuggling**
[CVE-2023-46589](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46589)

Tomcat did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A specially crafted
trailer header that exceeded the header size limit could cause Tomcat to
treat a single request as multiple requests leading to the possibility of
request smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.

This was fixed with commit
[aa92971e](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/aa92971e879a519384c517febc39fd04c48d4642).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 20 October 2023.
The issue was made public on 28 November 2023.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.95

### 2023-10-10 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.94

**Important: Request smuggling**
[CVE-2023-45648](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45648)

Tomcat did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A specially crafted,
invalid trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a single request as
multiple requests leading to the possibility of request smuggling when
behind a reverse proxy.

This was fixed with commit
[59583245](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/59583245639d8c42ae0009f4a4a70464d3ea70a0).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 12 September 2023.
The issue was made public on 10 October 2023.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.93

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2023-44487](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-44487)

Tomcat's HTTP/2 implementation was vulnerable to the rapid reset
attack. The denial of service typically manifested as an
`OutOfMemoryError`.

This was fixed with commit
[944332bb](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/944332bb15bd2f3bf76ec2caeb1ff0a58a3bc628).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 14 September 2023.
The issue was made public on 10 October 2023.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.93

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2023-42795](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-42795)

When recycling various internal objects, including the request and the
response, prior to re-use by the next request/response, an error could
cause Tomcat to skip some parts of the recycling process leading to
information leaking from the current request/response to the next.

This was fixed with commit
[30f8063d](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/30f8063d7a9b4c43ae4722f5e382a76af1d7a6bf).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat Security Team on 13 September
2023. The issue was made public on 10 October 2023.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.93

**Low: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2023-42794](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-42794)

Tomcat's internal fork of a Commons FileUpload included an unreleased, in
progress refactoring that exposed a potential denial of service on
Windows if a web application opened a stream for an uploaded file but
failed to close the stream. The file would never be deleted from disk
creating the possibility of an eventual denial of service due to the disk
being full.

This was fixed with commit
[c99ffc30](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/c99ffc30e95ddc4daede564d08cb5ea2b9a9da65).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 1 September
2023. The issue was made public on 10 October 2023.

Affects: 8.5.85 to 8.5.93

### 2023-08-25 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.93

**Moderate: Open redirect**
[CVE-2023-41080](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-41080)

If the ROOT (default) web application is configured to use FORM
authentication then it is possible that a specially crafted URL could be
used to trigger a redirect to an URL of the attackers choice.

This was fixed with commit
[4998ad74](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/4998ad745b67edeadefe541c94ed029b53933d3b).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 17 August 2023. The
issue was made public on 22 August 2023.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.92

### 2023-05-19 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.89

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2023-34981](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-34981)

The fix for bug [66512](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66512) introduced a regression that was fixed
as bug [66591](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66591). The regression meant that, if a response did not
have any HTTP headers set, no AJP `SEND_HEADERS` message would
be sent which in turn meant that at least one AJP based proxy
(mod\_proxy\_ajp) would use the response headers from the previous request
for the current request leading to an information leak.

This was fixed with commit
[2214c803](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/2214c8030522aa9b2a367dfa5d9acff1a03666ae).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 24 May 2023. The
issue was made public on 21 June 2023.

Affects: 8.5.88

### 2023-04-19 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.88

**Moderate: Apache Tomcat denial of service**
[CVE-2023-28709](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28709)

The fix for [CVE-2023-24998](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-24998) was incomplete. If non-default HTTP
connector settings were used such that the `maxParameterCount`
could be reached using query string parameters and a request was
submitted that supplied exactly `maxParameterCount` parameters
in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be
bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.

This was fixed with commit
[5badf94e](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/5badf94e79e5de206fc0ef3054fd536b1bb787cd).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 13 March 2023. The
issue was made public on 22 May 2023.

Affects: 8.5.85 to 8.5.87

### 2023-02-24 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.86

**Important: Apache Tomcat information disclosure**
[CVE-2023-28708](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28708)

When using the `RemoteIpFilter` with requests received from a
reverse proxy via HTTP that include the `X-Forwarded-Proto`
header set to `https`, session cookies created by Tomcat did not
include the secure attribute. This could result in the user agent
transmitting the session cookie over an insecure channel.

This was fixed with commit
[5b72c94e](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/5b72c94e8b2c4ada63a1d91dc527bf4d8fd1f510).

[66471](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66471) was reported publicly on 8 February 2023. The security
implications were identified by the Tomcat Security team on 9 February
2023. The issue was made public on 22 March 2023.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.85

### 2023-01-19 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.85

**Important: Apache Tomcat denial of service**
[CVE-2023-24998](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-24998)

Apache Tomcat uses a packaged renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload
to provide the file upload functionality defined in the Jakarta Servlet
specification. Apache Tomcat was, therefore, also vulnerable to the
Apache Commons FileUpload vulnerability [CVE-2023-24998](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-24998) as
there was no limit to the number of request parts processed. This
resulted in the possibility of an attacker triggering a DoS with a
malicious upload or series of uploads.

This was fixed with commit
[9ca96c8c](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/9ca96c8c1eba86c0aaa2e6be581ba2a7d4d4ae6e).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team on 11
December 2022. The issue was made public on 20 February 2023.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.84

### 2022-11-21 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.84

**Low: Apache Tomcat JsonErrorReportValve injection**
[CVE-2022-45143](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-45143)

The `JsonErrorReportValve` did not escape the
`type`, `message` or `description`
values. In some circumstances these are constructed from user provided
data and it was therefore possible for users to supply values that
invalidated or manipulated the JSON output.

This was fixed with commit
[0cab3a56](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/0cab3a56bd89f70e7481bb0d68395dc7e130dbbf).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security team on 2
September 2022. The issue was made public on 3 January 2023.

Affects: 8.5.83

### 2022-10-11 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.83

**Low: Apache Tomcat request smuggling**
[CVE-2022-42252](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-42252)

If Tomcat was configured to ignore invalid HTTP headers via setting
`rejectIllegalHeader` to `false` (the default),
Tomcat did not reject a request containing an invalid
`Content-Length` header making a request smuggling attack
possible if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that also failed to
reject the request with the invalid header.

This was fixed with commit
[a1c07906](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/a1c07906d8dcaf7957e5cc97f5cdbac7d18a205a).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team on 29
September 2022. The issue was made public on 31 October 2022.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.82

### 2022-08-13 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.82

**Low: Apache Tomcat XSS in examples web application**
[CVE-2022-34305](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34305)

The Form authentication example in the examples web application displayed
user provided data without filtering, exposing a XSS vulnerability.

This was fixed with commit
[5f6c88b0](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/5f6c88b054b0e4fbccff8b7f15974ed55d59a9f7).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team on 22 June
2022. The issue was made public on 23 June 2022.

Affects: 8.5.50 to 8.5.81

### 2022-05-23 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.79

**Low: Apache Tomcat EncryptInterceptor DoS**
[CVE-2022-29885](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-29885)

The documentation for the EncryptInterceptor incorrectly stated it
enabled Tomcat clustering to run over an untrusted network. This was not
correct. While the EncryptInterceptor does provide confidentiality and
integrity protection, it does not protect against all risks associated
with running over any untrusted network, particularly DoS risks.

This was fixed with commit
[b679bc62](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/b679bc627f5a4ea6510af95adfb7476b07eba890).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team by 4ra1n on 17
April 2022. The issue was made public on 10 May 2022.

Affects: 8.5.38 to 8.5.78

### 1 April 2022 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.78

**High: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2021-43980](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43980)

The simplified implementation of blocking reads and writes introduced in
Tomcat 10 and back-ported to Tomcat 9.0.47 onwards exposed a long
standing (but extremely hard to trigger) concurrency bug that could cause
client connections to share an Http11Processor instance resulting in
responses, or part responses, to be received by the wrong client.

This was fixed with commit
[4a00b0c0](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/4a00b0c0890538b9d3107eef8f2e0afadd119beb).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team by Adam
Thomas, Richard Hernandez and Ryan Schmitt on 11 November 2021. The issue
was made public on 28 September 2022.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.77

### 28 February 2022 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.76

**Important: Request mix-up**
[CVE-2022-25762](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25762)

If a web application sends a WebSocket message concurrently with the
WebSocket connection closing, it is possible that the application will
continue to use the socket after it has been closed. The error handling
triggered in this case could cause the a pooled object to be placed in
the pool twice. This could result in subsequent connections using the
same object concurrently which could result in data being returned to the
wrong use and/or other errors.

This was fixed with commit
[01f2cf25](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/01f2cf25b270a84d0daeefc4f215aa2f56e1df99).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 21
December 2021. The issue was made public on 12 May 2022.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.75

### 20 January 2022 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.75

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.74 but the
release vote for the 8.5.74 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 8.5.75 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for these issues, version 8.5.74 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Low: Local Privilege Escalation**
[CVE-2022-23181](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23181)

The fix for bug [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484) introduced a time of check, time
of use vulnerability that allowed a local attacker to perform actions
with the privileges of the user that the Tomcat process is using. This
issue is only exploitable when Tomcat is configured to persist sessions
using the FileStore.

This was fixed with commit
[97943959](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/97943959ba721ad5e8e8ba765a68d2b153348530).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team by Trung Pham
of Viettel Cyber Security on 10 December 2021. The issue was made public
on 26 January 2022.

Affects: 8.5.55 to 8.5.73

### 6 October 2021 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.72

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2021-42340](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42340)

The fix for bug [63362](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=63362) introduced a memory leak. The object
introduced to collect metrics for HTTP upgrade connections was not
released for WebSocket connections once the WebSocket connection was
closed. This created a memory leak that, over time, could lead to a
denial of service via an OutOfMemoryError.

This was fixed with commit
[d27535bd](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/d27535bdee95d252418201eb21e9d29476aa6b6a).

The memory leak was reported publicly via the users mailing list on 23
September 2021. The security implications were identified by the Tomcat
Security team the same day. The issue was made public on 14 October
2021.

Affects: 8.5.60 to 8.5.71

### 15 June 2021 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.68

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.67 but the
release vote for the 8.5.67 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 8.5.68 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for this issue, version 8.5.67 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Important: Request Smuggling**
[CVE-2021-33037](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-33037)

Apache Tomcat did not correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding request
header in some circumstances leading to the possibility of request
smuggling when used with a reverse proxy. Specifically: Tomcat
incorrectly ignored the transfer-encoding header if the client declared
it would only accept an HTTP/1.0 response; Tomcat honoured the identify
encoding; and Tomcat did not ensure that, if present, the chunked
encoding was the final encoding.

This was fixed with commits
[3202703e](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/3202703e6d635e39b74262e81f0cb4bcbe2170dc),

[8874fa02](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/8874fa02e9b36baa9ca6b226c0882c0190ca5a02).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team by Bahruz
Jabiyev, Steven Sprecher and Kaan Onarlioglu of NEU seclab on 7 May 2021.
The issue was made public on 12 July 2021.

This issue was identified and reported responsibly .

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.66

### 12 May 2021 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.66

**Low: Authentication weakness**
[CVE-2021-30640](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30640)

Queries made by the JNDI Realm did not always correctly escape
parameters. Parameter values could be sourced from user provided data (eg
user names) as well as configuration data provided by an administrator.
In limited circumstances it was possible for users to authenticate using
variations of their user name and/or to bypass some of the protection
provided by the LockOut Realm.

This was fixed with commits

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.65

### 6 April 2021 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.65

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2021-30639](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30639)

An error introduced as part of a change to improve error handling during
non-blocking I/O meant that the error flag associated with the Request
object was not reset between requests. This meant that once a
non-blocking I/O error occurred, all future requests handled by that
request object would fail. Users were able to trigger non-blocking I/O
errors, e.g. by dropping a connection, thereby creating the possibility
of triggering a DoS.

Applications that do not use non-blocking I/O are not exposed to this
vulnerability.

This was fixed with commit
[411caf29](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/411caf29ac1c16e6ac291b6e5543b2371dbd25e2).

This issue was reported publicly as [65203](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65203).

Affects: 8.5.64

### 10 March 2021 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.64

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2021-41079](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41079)

When Tomcat was configured to use NIO+OpenSSL or NIO2+OpenSSL for TLS, a
specially crafted packet could be used to trigger an infinite loop
resulting in a denial of service.

This was fixed with commit
[b90d4fc1](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/b90d4fc1ff44f30e4b3aba622ba6677e3f003822).

This issue was first reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by
Thomas Wozenilek on 26 February 2021 but could not be confirmed. A
speculative fix was applied on 3 March 2021. On 14 September 2021 David
Frankson of Infinite Campus independently reported the issue and included
a test case. This allowed both the issue and the speculative fix to be
verified. The issue was made public on 15 September 2021.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.63

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2024-21733](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21733)

Incomplete POST requests triggered an error response that could contain
data from a previous request from another user.

This was fixed with commit
[ce4b154e](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/ce4b154e7b48f66bd98858626347747cd2514311).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by xer0dayz
from Sn1perSecurity LLC on 20 December 2023. The issue was made public on
19 January 2024.

Affects: 8.5.7 to 8.5.63

### 2 February 2021 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.63

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.62 but the
release vote for the 8.5.62 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 8.5.63 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for these issues, version 8.5.62 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Low: Fix for [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484) was incomplete**
[CVE-2021-25329](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25329)

The fix for [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484) was incomplete. When using a
highly unlikely configuration edge case, the Tomcat instance was still
vulnerable to [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484). Note that both the previously
published prerequisites for [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484) and the previously
published non-upgrade mitigations for [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484) also apply to
this issue.

This was fixed with commit
[93f0cc40](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/93f0cc403a9210d469afc2bd9cf03ab3251c6f35).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team by Trung Pham
of Viettel Cyber Security on 12 January 2021. The issue was made public
on 1 March 2021.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.61

**Important: Request mix-up with h2c**
[CVE-2021-25122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25122)

When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat could
duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one
request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of
user A's request.

This was fixed with commit
[bb0e7c1e](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/bb0e7c1e0d737a0de7d794572517bce0e91d30fa).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security team on 11
January 2021. The issue was made public on 1 March 2021.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.61

### 17 November 2020 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.60

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2021-24122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24122)

When serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system
it was possible to bypass security constraints and/or view the source
code for JSPs in some configurations. The root cause was the unexpected
behaviour of the JRE API `File.getCanonicalPath()` which in
turn was caused by the inconsistent behaviour of the Windows API
(`FindFirstFileW`) in some circumstances.

This was fixed with commit
[920dddbd](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/920dddbdb981f92e8d5872a4bb126a10af5ca8a9).

This issue was reported the Apache Tomcat Security team by Ilja Brander
on 26 October 2020. The issue was made public on 14 January 2021.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.59

**Moderate: HTTP/2 request header mix-up**
[CVE-2020-17527](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-17527)

While investigating issue [64830](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=64830) it was discovered that Apache
Tomcat could re-use an HTTP request header value from the previous stream
received on an HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with the
subsequent stream. While this would most likely lead to an error and the
closure of the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could
leak between requests.

This was fixed with commit
[21e34086](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/21e3408671aac7e0d7e264e720cac8b1b189eb29).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security team on 10
November 2020. The issue was made public on 3 December 2020.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.59

### 15 September 2020 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.58

**Moderate: HTTP/2 request mix-up**
[CVE-2020-13943](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13943)

If an HTTP/2 client exceeded the agreed maximum number of concurrent
streams for a connection (in violation of the HTTP/2 protocol), it was
possible that a subsequent request made on that connection could contain
HTTP headers - including HTTP/2 pseudo headers - from a previous request
rather than the intended headers. This could lead to users seeing
responses for unexpected resources.

This was fixed with commit
[9d7def06](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/9d7def063b47407a09a2f9202beed99f4dcb292a).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security team on 23 July
2020. The issue was made public on 12 October 2020.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.57

### 5 July 2020 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.57

**Important: WebSocket DoS**
[CVE-2020-13935](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13935)

The payload length in a WebSocket frame was not correctly validated.
Invalid payload lengths could trigger an infinite loop. Multiple requests
with invalid payload lengths could lead to a denial of service.

This was fixed with commit
[12d71567](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/12d715676038efbf9c728af10163f8277fc019d5).

This issue was reported publicly via the Apache Bugzilla instance on 28
June 2020 and included references to high CPU but no specific reference
to denial of service. The associated DoS risks were identified by the
Apache Tomcat Security Team the same day. The issue was made public on 14
July 2020.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.56

**Moderate: HTTP/2 DoS**
[CVE-2020-13934](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13934)

An h2c direct connection did not release the HTTP/1.1 processor after the
upgrade to HTTP/2. If a sufficient number of such requests were made, an
OutOfMemoryException could occur leading to a denial of service.

This was fixed with commit
[923d8345](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/923d834500802a61779318911d7898bd85fc950e).

This issue was reported publicly via the Apache Tomcat Users mailing list
on 22 June 2020 without reference to the potential for DoS. After further
discussion to identify the steps necessary to reproduce the issue, the
root cause of the issue and the associated DoS risks were identified by
the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 26 June 2020. The issue was made
public on 14 July 2020.

Affects: 8.5.1 to 8.5.56

### 7 June 2020 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.56

**Important: HTTP/2 DoS**
[CVE-2020-11996](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11996)

A specially crafted sequence of HTTP/2 requests could trigger high CPU
usage for several seconds. If a sufficient number of such requests were
made on concurrent HTTP/2 connections, the server could become
unresponsive.

This was fixed with commit
[c8acd2ab](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/c8acd2ab7371e39aeca7c306f3b5380f00afe552).

This issue was reported publicly via the Apache Tomcat Users mailing list
on 21 May 2020 without reference to the potential for DoS. The DoS risks
were identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team the same day. The
issue was made public on 25 June 2020.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.55

### 11 May 2020 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.55

**Important: Remote Code Execution via session persistence**
[CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484)

If:

* an attacker is able to control the contents and name of a file on the
  server; and
* the server is configured to use the `PersistenceManager`
  with a `FileStore`; and
* the `PersistenceManager` is configured with
  `sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter="null"` (the default
  unless a `SecurityManager` is used) or a sufficiently lax
  filter to allow the attacker provided object to be deserialized;
  and
* the attacker knows the relative file path from the storage location
  used by `FileStore` to the file the attacker has control
  over;

then, using a specifically crafted request, the attacker will be able to
trigger remote code execution via deserialization of the file under their
control.

**Note:** All of conditions above must be true for the
attack to succeed.

As an alternative to upgrading to 8.5.35 or later, users may configure
the `PersistenceManager` with an appropriate value for
`sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter` to ensure that only
application provided attributes are serialized and deserialized.

This was fixed with commit
[ec08af18](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/ec08af18d0f9ddca3f2d800ef66fe7fd20afef2f).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by by jarvis
threedr3am of pdd security research on 12 April 2020. The issue was made
public on 20 May 2020.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.54

### 11 February 2020 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.51

**Important: AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution**
[CVE-2020-1938](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1938)

When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when
trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP
connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP
connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be
exploited in ways that may be surprising. Prior to Tomcat 8.5.51, Tomcat
shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all
configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security
guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required.

Prior to this vulnerability report, the known risks of an attacker being
able to access the AJP port directly were:

* bypassing security checks based on client IP address
* bypassing user authentication if Tomcat was configured to trust
  authentication data provided by the reverse proxy

This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed the
following:

* returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application
  including under the WEB-INF and META-INF directories or any other
  location reachable via ServletContext.getResourceAsStream()
* processing any file in the web application as a JSP

Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those
files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control
the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along
with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution
possible.

It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port
is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a
defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning
arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31
or later. Users should note that a number of changes were made to the
default AJP Connector configuration in 8.5.51 to harden the default
configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 8.5.51 or later
will need to make small changes to their configurations as a result.

This was fixed with commits

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 3 January
2020. The issue was made public on 24 February 2020.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.50

**Low: HTTP Request Smuggling**
[CVE-2020-1935](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1935)

The HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line (EOL)
parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This
led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was
located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid
Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is
considered unlikely.

This was fixed with commit
[8fbe2e96](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/8fbe2e962f0ea138d92361921643fe5abe0c4f56).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by @ZeddYu
on 25 December 2019. The issue was made public on 24
February 2020.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.50

**Low: HTTP Request Smuggling**
[CVE-2019-17569](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17569)

The refactoring in 8.5.48 introduced a regression. The result of the
regression was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were incorrectly
processed leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was
located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid
Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is
considered unlikely.

This was fixed with commit
[959f1dfd](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/959f1dfd767bf3cb64776b44f7395d1d8d8f7ab3).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by @ZeddYu
on 12 December 2019. The issue was made public on 24
February 2020.

Affects: 8.5.48 to 8.5.50

### 12 December 2019 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.50

**Low: Session fixation**
[CVE-2019-17563](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17563)

When using FORM authentication there was a narrow window where an
attacker could perform a session fixation attack. The window was
considered too narrow for an exploit to be practical but, erring on the
side of caution, this issue has been treated as a security
vulnerability.

This was fixed with commit
[e19a202e](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/e19a202ee43b6e2a538be5515ae0ab32d8ef112c).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by William
Marlow (IBM) on 19 November 2019. The issue was made public on 18
December 2019.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.49

### 21 November 2019 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.49

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.48 but the
release vote for the 8.0.48 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 8.0.49 to obtain a version that includes
the fix for this issue, version 8.0.48 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Moderate: Local Privilege Escalation**
[CVE-2019-12418](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12418)

When Tomcat is configured with the JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener, a local
attacker without access to the Tomcat process or configuration files is
able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack
to capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The
attacker can then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and
gain complete control over the Tomcat instance.

The JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener will be deprecated in future Tomcat
releases, will be removed for Tomcat 10 and may be removed from all
Tomcat releases some time after 31 December 2020.

Users should also be aware of [CVE-2019-2684](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-2684), a JRE
vulnerability that enables this issue to be exploited remotely.

This was fixed with commit
[a91d7db4](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/a91d7db4047d372b2f12999d3cf2bc3254c20d00).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by An Trinh of
Viettel Cyber Security on 10 October 2019. The issue was made public on 18
December 2019.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.47

### 13 May 2019 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.41

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2019-10072](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10072)

The fix for [CVE-2019-0199](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0199) was incomplete and did not address
HTTP/2 connection window exhaustion on write. By not sending
WINDOW\_UPDATE messages for the connection window (stream 0) clients were
able to cause server-side threads to block eventually leading to thread
exhaustion and a DoS.

This was fixed with commits
[0bcd69c9](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/0bcd69c9dd8ae0ff424f2cd46de51583510b7f35) and
[8d14c6f2](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/8d14c6f21d29768a39be4b6b9517060dc6606758).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by John
Simpson of Trend Micro Security Research working with Trend Micro's Zero
Day Initiative on 26 April 2019. The issue was made public on 20 June
2019.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.40

### 12 April 2019 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.40

**Important: Remote Code Execution on Windows**
[CVE-2019-0232](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0232)

When running on Windows with enableCmdLineArguments enabled, the CGI
Servlet is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to a bug in the way
the JRE passes command line arguments to Windows. The CGI Servlet is
disabled by default. For a detailed explanation of the JRE behaviour, see
[Markus
Wulftange's blog](https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2016/02/java-and-command-line-injections-in-windows.html) and this archived
[MSDN
blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/https%3A//blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/twistylittlepassagesallalike/2011/04/23/everyone-quotes-command-line-arguments-the-wrong-way/).

This was fixed with commit
[5bc4e6d7](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/5bc4e6d7b1c22dc1bf99f475b7e70594ebdd83b9).

This issue was identified by Nightwatch Cybersecurity Research and
reported to the Apache Tomcat security team via the bug bounty program
sponsored by the EU FOSSA-2 project on 3rd March 2019. The issue was made
public on 10 April 2019.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.39

**Low: XSS in SSI printenv**
[CVE-2019-0221](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0221)

The SSI printenv command echoes user provided data without escaping and
is, therefore, vulnerable to XSS. SSI is disabled by default. The
printenv command is intended for debugging and is unlikely to be present
in a production website.

This was fixed with commit
[4fcdf706](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/4fcdf706f3ecf35912a600242f89637f5acb32da).

This issue was identified by Nightwatch Cybersecurity Research and
reported to the Apache Tomcat security team via the bug bounty program
sponsored by the EU FOSSA-2 project on 7th March 2019. The issue was made
public on 17 May 2019.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.39

### 8 February 2019 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.38

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2019-0199](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0199)

The HTTP/2 implementation accepted streams with excessive numbers of
`SETTINGS` frames and also permitted clients to keep streams
open without reading/writing request/response data. By keeping streams
open for requests that utilised the Servlet API's blocking I/O, clients
were able to cause server-side threads to block eventually leading to
thread exhaustion and a DoS.

This was fixed in revisions [1852707](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1852707),
[1852711](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1852711),

[60a3af17](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/60a3af1738879ec06fac1ecb8a149608782f7cc9).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by Michal Karm
Babacek from Red Hat, Inc on 4 January 2019 with additional issues
identified by the Tomcat Security Team. The issue was made public on 25
March 2019.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.37

### 10 September 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.34

**Moderate: Open Redirect**
[CVE-2018-11784](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11784)

When the default servlet returned a redirect to a directory (e.g.
redirecting to `/foo/` when the user requested
`/foo`) a specially crafted URL could be used to cause the
redirect to be generated to any URI of the attackers choice.

This was fixed in revision [1840056](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1840056).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by Sergey
Bobrov on 28 August 2018 and made public on 3 October 2018.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.33

### 6 July 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.53

**Low: host name verification missing in WebSocket client**
[CVE-2018-8034](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8034)

The host name verification when using TLS with the WebSocket client was
missing. It is now enabled by default.

This was fixed in revision [1833759](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1833759).

This issue was reported publicly on 11 June 2018 and formally announced as
a vulnerability on 22 July 2018.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.52

**Low: CORS filter has insecure defaults**
[CVE-2018-8014](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8014)

The defaults settings for the CORS filter are insecure and enable
`supportsCredentials` for all origins. It is expected that
users of the CORS filter will have configured it appropriately for their
environment rather than using it in the default configuration. Therefore,
it is expected that most users will not be impacted by this issue.

This was fixed in revision [1831729](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1831729).

This issue was reported publicly on 1 May 2018 and formally announced as
a vulnerability on 16 May 2018.

### 26 June 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.32

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2018-8037](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8037)

If an async request was completed by the application at the same time as
the container triggered the async timeout, a race condition existed that
could result in a user seeing a response intended for a different user.
An additional issue was present in the NIO and NIO2 connectors that did
not correctly track the closure of the connection when an async request
was completed by the application and timed out by the container at the
same time. This could also result in a user seeing a response intended
for another user.

This was fixed in revisions [1833826](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1833826),
[1833832](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1833832),

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by Dmitry
Treskunov on 16 June 2018 and made public on 22 July 2018.

Affects: 8.5.5 to 8.5.31

**Low: host name verification missing in WebSocket client**
[CVE-2018-8034](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8034)

The host name verification when using TLS with the WebSocket client was
missing. It is now enabled by default.

This was fixed in revision [1833758](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1833758).

This issue was reported publicly on 11 June 2018 and formally announced as
a vulnerability on 22 July 2018.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.31

**Low: CORS filter has insecure defaults**
[CVE-2018-8014](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8014)

This issue was reported publicly on 1 May 2018 and formally announced as
a vulnerability on 16 May 2018.

### 08 May 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.52

**Important: A bug in the UTF-8 decoder can lead to DoS**
[CVE-2018-1336](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1336)

An improper handing of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder with
supplementary characters can lead to an infinite loop in the
decoder causing a Denial of Service.

This was fixed in revision [1830375](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1830375).

This issue was reported publicly on 6 April 2018 and formally announced as
a vulnerability on 22 July 2018.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.51

### 4 May 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.31

**Important: A bug in the UTF-8 decoder can lead to DoS**
[CVE-2018-1336](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1336)

An improper handing of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder with
supplementary characters can lead to an infinite loop in the
decoder causing a Denial of Service.

This was fixed in revision [1830374](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1830374).

This issue was reported publicly on 6 April 2018 and formally announced as
a vulnerability on 22 July 2018.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.30

### 13 February 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.50

**Important: Security constraint annotations applied too
late** [CVE-2018-1305](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1305)

Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets were only applied
once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in
this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that point, it was
possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded - for some
security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources
to users who were not authorised to access them.

This was fixed in revisions [1823319](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1823319) and
[1824359](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1824359).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security on 1 February
2018 and made public on 23 February 2018.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49

**Important: Security constraints mapped to context root are
ignored** [CVE-2018-1304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1304)

The URL pattern of "" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the
context root was not correctly handled when used as part of a security
constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was,
therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web
application resources that should have been protected. Only security
constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.

This was fixed in revision [1823308](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1823308).

This issue was reported publicly as [62067](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62067) on 31 January 2018
and the security implications identified by the Apache Tomcat Security
Team the same day. It was made public on 23 February 2018.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49

### 12 December 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.48

**Low: Incorrectly documented CGI search algorithm**
[CVE-2017-15706](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15706)

As part of the fix for bug [61201](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61201), the description of the
search algorithm used by the CGI Servlet to identify which script to
execute was updated. The update was not correct. As a result, some
scripts may have failed to execute as expected and other scripts may have
been executed unexpectedly. Note that the behaviour of the CGI servlet
has remained unchanged in this regard. It is only the documentation of
the behaviour that was wrong and has been corrected.

This was fixed in revision [1814827](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1814827).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by Jan Michael
Greiner on 17 September 2017 and made public on 31 January 2018.

Affects: 8.0.45 to 8.0.47

### 30 November 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.24

### 4 October 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.47

**Important: Remote Code Execution**
[CVE-2017-12617](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12617)

When running with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the
`readonly` initialisation parameter of the Default servlet to
false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially
crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it
contained would be executed by the server.

This was fixed in revision [1809921](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1809921).

This issue was first reported publicly followed by multiple reports to
the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 20 September 2017.

### 1 July 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.45

**Moderate: Cache Poisoning**
[CVE-2017-7674](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7674)

The CORS Filter did not add an HTTP Vary header indicating that the
response varies depending on Origin. This permitted client and server
side cache poisoning in some circumstances.

This was fixed in revision [1795815](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1795815).

The issue was reported as bug [61101](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61101) on 16 May 2017. The full
implications of this issue were identified by the Tomcat Security Team
the same day. This issue was made public on 10 August 2017.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.44

### 26 June 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.16

**Important: Security Constraint Bypass**
[CVE-2017-7675](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7675)

The HTTP/2 implementation bypassed a number of security checks that
prevented directory traversal attacks. It was therefore possible to
bypass security constraints using an specially crafted URL.

This was fixed in revision [1796091](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1796091).

The issue was originally reported as a failure to process URL path
parameters in bug [61120](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61120) on 24 May 2017. The full implications
of this issue were identified by the Tomcat Security Team the same day.

### 16 May 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.44

**Important: Security Constraint Bypass**
[CVE-2017-5664](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5664)

The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that,
when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the error that
occurred, the original request and response are forwarded to the error
page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the
original HTTP method.

If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve content
of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP
method. Tomcat's Default Servlet did not do this. Depending on the
original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for
static error pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to
permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page.

Notes for other user provided error pages:

* Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP method.
  JSPs used as error pages must ensure that they handle any error
  dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.
* By default, the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the
  HTTP method. Custom Servlets used as error pages must ensure that
  they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the
  actual method.

This was fixed in revisions [1793470](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1793470) and
[1793489](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1793489).

This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by
Aniket Nandkishor Kulkarni from Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Mumbai,
India as a vulnerability that allowed the restrictions on OPTIONS and
TRACE requests to be bypassed on 21 April 2017. The full implications of
this issue were identified by the Tomcat Security Team on 24 April 2017.
This issue was made public on 6 June 2017.

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2017-5647](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5647)

A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests when send file was used
resulted in the pipelined request being lost when send file processing of
the previous request completed. This could result in responses appearing
to be sent for the wrong request. For example, a user agent that sent
requests A, B and C could see the correct response for request A, the
response for request C for request B and no response for request C.

This was fixed in revision [1788999](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1788999).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 20
March 2017 and made public on 10 April 2017.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.42

### 30 March 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.13

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2017-5651](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5651)

The refactoring of the HTTP connectors for 8.5.x onwards, introduced a
regression in the send file processing. If the send file processing
completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the
processor cache twice. This could result in the same Processor being used
for multiple requests which in turn could lead to unexpected errors
and/or response mix-up.

This was fixed in revision [1788546](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1788546).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 24
March 2017 and made public on 10 April 2017.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.12

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2017-5650](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5650)

The handling of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close
streams associated with that connection that were currently waiting for a
WINDOW\_UPDATE before allowing the application to write more data. These
waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious client could
therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests that would consume all
available processing threads.

This was fixed in revision [1788480](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1788480).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by Chun Han
Hsiao on 11 March 2017 and made public on 10 April 2017.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.12

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2017-5647](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5647)

A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests when send file was used
resulted in the pipelined request being lost when send file processing of
the previous request completed. This could result in responses appearing
to be sent for the wrong request. For example, a user agent that sent
requests A, B and C could see the correct response for request A, the
response for request C for request B and no response for request C.

This was fixed in revision [1788932](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1788932).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 20
March 2017 and made public on 10 April 2017.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.12

### 14 March 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.42

**Low: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2017-5648](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5648)

While investigating bug 60718, it was noticed that some calls to
application listeners did not use the appropriate facade object. When
running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager, it was
therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a reference
to the request or response object and thereby access and/or modify
information associated with another web application.

This was fixed in revision [1785776](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1785776).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 20
March 2017 and made public on 10 April 2017.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.41

### 13 March 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.12

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.11

### 24 January 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.41

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.40 but the
release vote for the 8.0.40 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 8.0.41 to obtain a version that includes
the fix for this issue, version 8.0.40 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-8745](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8745)

A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP
connector resulted in the current Processor object being added to the
Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same
Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can
result in information leakage between requests including, but not limited
to, session ID and the response body.

This was fixed in revision [1777469](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1777469).

This issue was identified as affecting 8.0.x by the Apache Tomcat Security
Team on 3 January 2016 and made public on 5 January 2017.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.39

### 16 January 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.11

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.10 but the
release vote for the 8.5.10 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 8.5.11 to obtain a version that includes
the fix for this issue, version 8.5.10 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Moderate: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-8747](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8747)

The refactoring to make wider use of ByteBuffer introduced a regression
that could cause information to leak between requests on the same
connection. When running behind a reverse proxy, this could result in
information leakage between users. All HTTP connector variants are
affected but HTTP/2 and AJP are not affected.

This was fixed in revision [1774166](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1774166).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 14
December 2016 and made public on 13 March 2017.

Affects: 8.5.7 to 8.5.9

### 8 December 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.9

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-8745](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8745)

### 14 November 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.39

**Important: Remote Code Execution**
[CVE-2016-8735](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8735)

The `JmxRemoteLifecycleListener` was not updated to take
account of Oracle's fix for [CVE-2016-3427](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3427). Therefore, Tomcat
installations using this listener remained vulnerable to a similar remote
code execution vulnerability. This issue has been rated as important
rather than critical due to the small number of installations using this
listener and that it would be highly unusual for the JMX ports to be
accessible to an attacker even when the listener is used.

This was fixed in revision [1767656](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1767656).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 19 October
2016 and made public on 22 November 2016.

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-6816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816)

The code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters.
This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted
the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject
data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the
attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain
sensitive information from requests other then their own.

This was fixed in revision [1767653](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1767653).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 11
October 2016 and made public on 22 November 2016.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.38

### 8 November 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.8

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.7 but the
release vote for the 8.5.7 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 8.5.8 to obtain a version that includes
fixes for these issues, version 8.5.7 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Important: Remote Code Execution**

The HTTP/2 header parser entered an infinite loop if a header was
received that was larger than the available buffer. This made a denial of
service attack possible.

This was fixed in revision [1765798](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1765798).

This issue was reported as [60232](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60232) on 10 October 2016 and the

### 5 September 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.5 and 8.0.37

**Low: Unrestricted Access to Global Resources**
[CVE-2016-6797](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6797)

The ResourceLinkFactory did not limit web application access to global
JNDI resources to those resources explicitly linked to the web
application. Therefore, it was possible for a web application to access
any global JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been
configured or not.

This was fixed in revision [1757272](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1757272) for
8.5.x and revision [1757273](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1757273) for
8.0.x.

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 18
January 2016 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.4, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.36

**Low: Security Manager Bypass**
[CVE-2016-6796](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6796)

A malicious web application was able to bypass a configured
SecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration parameters for the
JSP Servlet.

This was fixed in revisions [1758493](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1758493) and
[1763233](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1763233) for 8.5.x and revisions

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 27
December 2015 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.4, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.36

**Low: System Property Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-6794](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6794)

When a SecurityManager is configured, a web application's ability to read
system properties should be controlled by the SecurityManager. Tomcat's
system property replacement feature for configuration files could be used
by a malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager and read
system properties that should not be visible.

This was fixed in revision [1754726](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1754726) for
8.5.x and revision [1754727](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1754727) for

**Low: Timing Attack**
[CVE-2016-0762](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0762)

The Realm implementations did not process the supplied password if the
supplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to
determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration includes
the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability
harder.

This was fixed in revision [1758500](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1758500) for
8.5.x and revision [1758501](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1758501) for

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 1 January
2016 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.4, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.36

### 13 June 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.5.3 and 8.0.36

**Moderate: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2016-3092](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3092)

Apache Tomcat uses a package renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload to
implement the file upload requirements of the Servlet specification. A
denial of service vulnerability was identified in Commons FileUpload that
occurred when the length of the multipart boundary was just below the
size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file. This
caused the file upload process to take several orders of magnitude
longer than if the boundary was the typical tens of bytes long.

This was fixed in revision [1743722](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1743722) for
8.5.x and revision [1743738](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1743738) for
8.0.x.

This issue was identified by the TERASOLUNA Framework Development Team
and reported to the Apache Commons team via JPCERT on 9 May 2016. It was
made public on 21 June 2016.

Affects: 8.5.0 to 8.5.2, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.35

### 8 February 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.32

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.31 but the
release vote for the 8.0.31 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 8.0.32 to obtain a version that includes
fixes for these issues, version 8.0.31 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Low: Session Fixation**
[CVE-2015-5346](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5346)

When recycling the `Request` object to use for a new request,
the `requestedSessionSSL` field was not recycled. This meant that
a session ID provided in the next request to be processed using the recycled
`Request` object could be used when it should not have been. This
gave the client the ability to control the session ID. In theory, this could
have been used as part of a session fixation attack but it would have been
hard to achieve as the attacker would not have been able to force the victim
to use the 'correct' `Request` object. It was also necessary for
at least one web application to be configured to use the SSL session ID as
the HTTP session ID. This is not a common configuration.

This was fixed in revisions [1713185](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1713185) and
[1723506](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1723506).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 22 June 2014
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.30

**Moderate: CSRF token leak**
[CVE-2015-5351](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5351)

The index page of the Manager and Host Manager applications included a
valid CSRF token when issuing a redirect as a result of an
unauthenticated request to the root of the web application. If an
attacker had access to the Manager or Host Manager applications
(typically these applications are only accessible to internal users, not
exposed to the Internet), this token could then be used by the attacker
to construct a CSRF attack.

This was fixed in revisions [1720658](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1720658) and
[1720660](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1720660).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 8 December 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.30

**Low: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2016-0706](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0706)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

The internal StatusManagerServlet could be loaded by a malicious web
application when a security manager was configured. This servlet could
then provide the malicious web application with a list of all deployed
applications and a list of the HTTP request lines for all requests
currently being processed. This could have exposed sensitive information
from other web applications, such as session IDs, to the web
application.

This was fixed in revision [1722800](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1722800).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 December 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.30

**Moderate: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2016-0714](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0714)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

Tomcat provides several session persistence mechanisms. The
`StandardManager` persists session over a restart. The
`PersistentManager` is able to persist sessions to files, a
database or a custom `Store`. The cluster implementation
persists sessions to one or more additional nodes in the cluster. All of
these mechanisms could be exploited to bypass a security manager. Session
persistence is performed by Tomcat code with the permissions assigned to
Tomcat internal code. By placing a carefully crafted object into a
session, a malicious web application could trigger the execution of
arbitrary code.

This was fixed in revisions [1726196](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1726196) and
[1726203](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1726203).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 November 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.30

**Moderate: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2016-0763](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0763)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

`ResourceLinkFactory.setGlobalContext()` is a public method
and was accessible to web applications even when running under a security
manager. This allowed a malicious web application to inject a malicious
global context that could in turn be used to disrupt other web
applications and/or read and write data owned by other web
applications.

This was fixed in revision [1725929](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1725929).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 18 January 2016
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.30

### 6 December 2015 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.30

**Low: Directory disclosure**
[CVE-2015-5345](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5345)

When accessing a directory protected by a security constraint with a URL
that did not end in a slash, Tomcat would redirect to the URL with the
trailing slash thereby confirming the presence of the directory before
processing the security constraint. It was therefore possible for a user
to determine if a directory existed or not, even if the user was not
permitted to view the directory. The issue also occurred at the root of a
web application in which case the presence of the web application was
confirmed, even if a user did not have access.

The solution was to implement the redirect in the DefaultServlet so that
any security constraints and/or security enforcing Filters were processed
before the redirect. The Tomcat team recognised that moving the redirect
could cause regressions so two new Context configuration options
(`mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled` and
`mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled`) were introduced. The initial
default was `false` for both since this was more secure.
However, due to regressions such as
[Bug
58765](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58765) the default for `mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled`
was later changed to true since it was viewed that the regression was
more serious than the security risk of associated with being able to
determine if a web application was deployed at a given path.

This was fixed in revisions [1715207](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1715207) and
[1717209](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1717209).

This issue was identified by Mark Koek of QCSec on 12 October 2015 and
made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.29

### 1 October 2015 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.27

**Low: Limited directory traversal**
[CVE-2015-5174](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5174)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

When accessing resources via the `ServletContext` methods
`getResource()` `getResourceAsStream()` and
`getResourcePaths()` the paths should be limited to the
current web application. The validation was not correct and paths of the
form `"/.."` were not rejected. Note that paths starting with
`"/../"` were correctly rejected. This bug allowed malicious
web applications running under a security manager to obtain a directory
listing for the directory in which the web application had been deployed.
This should not be possible when running under a security manager.
Typically, the directory listing that would be exposed would be for
`$CATALINA_BASE/webapps.`

This was fixed in revisions [1696281](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1696281) and
[1700897](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1700897).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 August 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.26

### 16 January 2015 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.17

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.16 but the
release vote for the 8.0.16 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 8.0.17 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for this issue, version 8.0.16 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Moderate: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2014-7810](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7810)

Malicious web applications could use expression language to bypass the
protections of a Security Manager as expressions were evaluated within a
privileged code section.

This was fixed in revisions [1644018](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1644018) and
[1645642](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1645642).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 2 November 2014
and made public on 14 May 2015.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.15

### 24 June 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.9

**Important: Request Smuggling**
[CVE-2014-0227](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0227)

It was possible to craft a malformed chunk as part of a chunked request
that caused Tomcat to read part of the request body as a new request.

This was fixed in revisions [1600984](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1600984),
[1601329](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1601329),
[1601330](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1601330) and
[1601332](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1601332).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 30 May 2014
and made public on 9 February 2015.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.8

**Low: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0230](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0230)

When a response for a request with a request body is returned to the user
agent before the request body is fully read, by default Tomcat swallows the
remaining request body so that the next request on the connection may be
processed. There was no limit to the size of request body that Tomcat would
swallow. This permitted a limited Denial of Service as Tomcat would never
close the connection and a processing thread would remain allocated to the
connection.

This was fixed in revision [1603770](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1603770)
and improved in revisions [1603775](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1603775),
[1603779](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1603779),
[1609175](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1609175) and
[1659294](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1659294).

This issue was disclosed to the Tomcat security team by AntBean@secdig
from the Baidu Security Team on 4 June 2014 and made public on 9 April
2015.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.8

### beta, 21 May 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.8

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.6 but the
release votes for the 8.0.6 and 8.0.7 release candidates did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 8.0.8 to obtain a version that
includes a fix for this issue, versions 8.0.6 and 8.0.7 are not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Low: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0119](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0119)

In limited circumstances it was possible for a malicious web application
to replace the XML parsers used by Tomcat to process XSLTs for the
default servlet, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs) and tag
plugin configuration files. The injected XML parser(s) could then bypass
the limits imposed on XML external entities and/or have visibility of the
XML files processed for other web applications deployed on the same
Tomcat instance.

This was fixed in revisions [1588193](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1588193),
[1589837](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1589837),
[1589980](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1589980),

[1589990](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1589990) and
[1589992](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1589992).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 April 2014
and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.5

### beta, 27 Mar 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.5

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.4 but the
release vote for the 8.0.4 release candidate did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 8.0.5 to obtain a version that
includes fixes for these issues, version 8.0.4 is not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0075](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0075)

It was possible to craft a malformed chunk size as part of a chucked
request that enabled an unlimited amount of data to be streamed to the
server, bypassing the various size limits enforced on a request. This
enabled a denial of service attack.

This was fixed in revision [1578337](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1578337).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat security team by David Jorm of the
Red Hat Security Response Team on 28 February 2014 and made public on 27
May 2014.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.3

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0095](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0095)

A regression was introduced in [1519838](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1519838)
that caused AJP requests to hang if an explicit content length of zero
was set on the request. The hanging request consumed a request processing
thread which could lead to a denial of service.

This was fixed in revision [1578392](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1578392).

This issue was reported as a possible bug via the Tomcat users mailing
list on 3 March 2014 and the security implications were identified by the
Tomcat security team on the same day. This issue was made public on 27
May 2014.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC2 to 8.0.3

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0096)

The default servlet allows web applications to define (at multiple
levels) an XSLT to be used to format a directory listing. When running
under a security manager, the processing of these was not subject to the
same constraints as the web application. This enabled a malicious web
application to bypass the file access constraints imposed by the security
manager via the use of external XML entities.

This was fixed in revisions [1578610](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1578610) and
[1578611](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1578611).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 February 2014
and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.3

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0099](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0099)

The code used to parse the request content length header did not check
for overflow in the result. This exposed a request smuggling
vulnerability when Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that
correctly processed the content length header.

This was fixed in revision [1578812](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1578812).

A test case that demonstrated the parsing bug was sent to the Tomcat
security team on 13 March 2014 but no context was provided. The security
implications were identified by the Tomcat security team the day the
report was received and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.3

### beta, 11 Feb 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.3

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.2 but the
release vote for the 8.0.2 release candidates did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 8.0.3 to obtain a version that
includes a fix for this issue, version 8.0.2 is not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0050](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0050)

It was possible to craft a malformed Content-Type header for a multipart
request that caused Apache Tomcat to enter an infinite loop. A malicious
user could, therefore, craft a malformed request that triggered a denial
of service.

The root cause of this error was a bug in Apache Commons FileUpload.
Tomcat 8 uses a packaged renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload to
implement the requirement of the Servlet 3.0 and later specifications to
support the processing of mime-multipart requests. Tomcat 8 was therefore
affected by this issue.

This was fixed in revision [1565163](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1565163).

This issue was reported to the Apache Software Foundation on 04 Feb 2014
and accidently made public on 06 Feb 2014.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.1

### alpha, 26 Dec 2013 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC10

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC6 but the
release votes for 8.0.0-RC6 to 8.0.0-RC9 did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 8.0.0-RC10 to obtain a version
that includes a fix for this issue, versions 8.0.0-RC6 to 8.0.0-RC9 are
not included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2013-4322](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4322)

The fix for CVE-2012-3544 was not complete. It did not cover the
following cases:

* chunk extensions were not limited
* whitespace after the : in a trailing header was not limited

This was fixed in revisions [1521834](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1521834) and
[1549522](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1549522).

The first part of this issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security
team on 27 August 2013 and the second part by Saran Neti of TELUS
Security Labs on 5 November 2013. It was made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.0-RC5

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2013-4590](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4590)

Application provided XML files such as web.xml, context.xml, \*.tld,
\*.tagx and \*.jspx allowed XXE which could be used to expose Tomcat
internals to an attacker. This vulnerability only occurs when Tomcat is
running web applications from untrusted sources such as in a shared
hosting environment.

This was fixed in revision [1549528](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1549528).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team on 29
October 2013 and made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.0-RC5

### alpha, 23 Sep 2013 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC3

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC2 but the
release vote for 8.0.0-RC2 did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 8.0.0-RC3 to obtain a version
that includes a fix for this issue, version 8.0.0-RC2 is not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2013-4286](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4286)

The fix for CVE-2005-2090 was not complete. It did not cover the
following cases:

* content-length header with chunked encoding over any HTTP connector
* multiple content-length headers over any AJP connector

Requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length
header when chunked encoding is being used should be rejected as invalid.
When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat) process
a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain either multiple
content-length headers or a content-length header when chunked encoding
is being used and several components do not reject the request and make
different decisions as to which content-length header to use an attacker
can poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and obtain sensitive
information from requests other then their own. Tomcat now rejects
requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length
header when chunked encoding is being used.

This was fixed in revision [1521829](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1521829).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team on 15 August
2013 and made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 8.0.0-RC1

### Not a vulnerability in Tomcat

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2017-6056](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6056)

In February 2015 a single user reported high CPU usage ([57544](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57544))
which was traced to a tight loop. However, it was not clear how the
conditions necessary to enter the loop were being created. There was no
evidence that indicated that the loop was user triggerable. The only
potential paths identified by code inspection depended on application
bugs (retaining references to request objects and accessing after the
request had completed).

It was (and still is) believed that an application bug was the most
likely root cause. Therefore, [57544](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57544) was not treated as a DoS
vulnerability.

In November 2016, [CVE-2016-6816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816) was announced. When downstream
distributions, notably Debian, back-ported the fix for
[CVE-2016-6816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816) they inadvertently make it trivial for users to
trigger the tight loop from [57544](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57544). This made a DoS attack
trivial to mount and resulted in multiple reports of problems including
[60578](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60578) and [60581](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60581).

Tomcat releases from the Apache Software Foundation were not affected as
the ASF did not release any versions that contained the fix for
[CVE-2016-6816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816) but not the fix for [57544](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57544).

This issue was first announced on 13 February 2017.

Affects: Debian, Ubuntu and potentially other downstream
distributions.

**Important: Remote Memory Read**
[CVE-2014-0160](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160) (a.k.a. "Heartbleed")

A bug in certain versions of [OpenSSL](www.openssl.org)
can allow an unauthenticated remote user to read certain contents of
the server's memory. Binary versions of tcnative 1.1.24 - 1.1.29
include this vulnerable version of OpenSSL. tcnative 1.1.30 and later
ship with patched versions of OpenSSL.

This issue was first announced on 7 April 2014.

Affects: OpenSSL 1.0.1-1.0.1f, tcnative 1.1.24-1.1.29

### Not a vulnerability in Tomcat

**Critical: Remote Code Execution via log4j**
[CVE-2021-44228](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228)

Apache Tomcat 8.5.x has no dependency on any version of log4j.

Web applications deployed on Apache Tomcat may have a dependency on
log4j. You should seek support from the application vendor in this
instance.

It is possible to configure Apache Tomcat 8.5.x to use log4j 2.x for
Tomcat's internal logging. This requires explicit configuration and the
addition of the log4j 2.x library. Anyone who has switched Tomcat's
internal logging to log4j 2.x is likely to need to address this
vulnerability.

The first few releases of 8.5.x (8.5.3 and earlier) provided optional
support for switching Tomcat's internal logging to log4j 1.x. Anyone one
using these very old (5+ years), unsupported versions of Tomcat that
switched to using log4j 1.x may need to address this vulnerability as
log4j 1.x may be affected in some (probably rarely used) configurations.
Regardless, they'll need to address the Tomcat vulnerabilities that have
been made public in those 5+ years

In most cases, disabling the problematic feature will be the simplest
solution. Exactly how to do that depends on the exact version of log4j
2.x being used. Details are provided on the
[log4j 2.x
security page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Apache Tomcat 7.x vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat® 7.x. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
version with a question mark.

**Note:** Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.

**Please note that Tomcat 7.0.x has reached
[end of life](tomcat-70-eol.html) and is no longer supported.
Further vulnerabilities in the 7.0.x branch will not be fixed. Users
should upgrade to 8.5.x or later to obtain security fixes.**

Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to
apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the
Apache Tomcat version that you are using. For Tomcat 7.0 those are
[`building.html`](/tomcat-7.0-doc/building.html) and
[`BUILDING.txt`](/tomcat-7.0-doc/BUILDING.txt).
Both files can be found in the `webapps/docs` subdirectory
of a binary distributive. You may also want to review the
[Security Considerations](/tomcat-7.0-doc/security-howto.html)
page in the documentation.

If you need help on building or configuring Tomcat or other help on
following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed
here, please send your questions to the public
[Tomcat Users mailing list](lists.html)

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other
unexpected behaviour that has [security
impact](security-impact.html), or if the descriptions here are incomplete,
please report them privately to the
[Tomcat Security Team](security.html). Thank you.

### 26 April 2021 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.109

**Low: Authentication weakness**
[CVE-2021-30640](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30640)

Queries made by the JNDI Realm did not always correctly escape
parameters. Parameter values could be sourced from user provided data (eg
user names) as well as configuration data provided by an administrator.
In limited circumstances it was possible for users to authenticate using
variations of their user name and/or to bypass some of the protection
provided by the LockOut Realm.

This was fixed with commit
[e21eb476](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/e21eb4764ccda55e5a35a5a7c19a6fd2b0757fe9).

This issue was reported publicly as [65224](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65224).

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.108

### 5 February 2021 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.108

**Low: Fix for [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484) was incomplete**
[CVE-2021-25329](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25329)

The fix for [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484) was incomplete. When using a
highly unlikely configuration edge case, the Tomcat instance was still
vulnerable to [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484). Note that both the previously
published prerequisites for [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484) and the previously
published non-upgrade mitigations for [CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484) also apply to
this issue.

This was fixed with commit
[74b10565](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/74b105657ffbd1d1de80455f03446c3bbf30d1f5).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team by Trung Pham
of Viettel Cyber Security on 12 January 2021. The issue was made public
on 1 March 2021.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.107

### 11 November 2020 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.107

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2021-24122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24122)

When serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system
it was possible to bypass security constraints and/or view the source
code for JSPs in some configurations. The root cause was the unexpected
behaviour of the JRE API `File.getCanonicalPath()` which in
turn was caused by the inconsistent behaviour of the Windows API
(`FindFirstFileW`) in some circumstances.

This was fixed with commit
[800b0314](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/800b03140e640f8892f27021e681645e8e320177).

This issue was reported the Apache Tomcat Security team by Ilja Brander
on 26 October 2020. The issue was made public on 14 January 2021.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.106

### 7 July 2020 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.105

**Important: WebSocket DoS**
[CVE-2020-13935](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13935)

The payload length in a WebSocket frame was not correctly validated.
Invalid payload lengths could trigger an infinite loop. Multiple requests
with invalid payload lengths could lead to a denial of service.

This was fixed with commits
[f9f75c14](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/f9f75c14678b68633f79030ddf4ff827f014cc84) and
[4c049828](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/4c04982870d6e730c38e21e58fb653b7cf723784).

This issue was reported publicly via the Apache Bugzilla instance on 28
June 2020 and included references to high CPU but no specific reference
to denial of service. The associated DoS risks were identified by the
Apache Tomcat Security Team the same day. The issue was made public on 14
July 2020.

Affects: 7.0.27 to 7.0.104

### 16 May 2020 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.104

**High: Remote Code Execution via session persistence**
[CVE-2020-9484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484)

If:

* an attacker is able to control the contents and name of a file on the
  server; and
* the server is configured to use the `PersistenceManager`
  with a `FileStore`; and
* the `PersistenceManager` is configured with
  `sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter="null"` (the default
  unless a `SecurityManager` is used) or a sufficiently lax
  filter to allow the attacker provided object to be deserialized;
  and
* the attacker knows the relative file path from the storage location
  used by `FileStore` to the file the attacker has control
  over;

then, using a specifically crafted request, the attacker will be able to
trigger remote code execution via deserialization of the file under their
control.

**Note:** All of conditions above must be true for the
attack to succeed.

As an alternative to upgrading to 7.0.104 or later, users may configure
the `PersistenceManager` with an appropriate value for
`sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter` to ensure that only
application provided attributes are serialized and deserialized.

This was fixed with commit
[53e30390](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/53e30390943c18fca0c9e57dbcc14f1c623cfd06).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by by jarvis
threedr3am of pdd security research on 12 April 2020. The issue was made
public on 20 May 2020.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.103

### 14 February 2020 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.100

**High: AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution**
[CVE-2020-1938](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1938)

When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when
trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP
connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP
connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be
exploited in ways that may be surprising. Prior to Tomcat 7.0.100, Tomcat
shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all
configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security
guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required.

Prior to this vulnerability report, the known risks of an attacker being
able to access the AJP port directly were:

* bypassing security checks based on client IP address
* bypassing user authentication if Tomcat was configured to trust
  authentication data provided by the reverse proxy

This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed the
following:

* returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application
  including under the WEB-INF and META-INF directories or any other
  location reachable via ServletContext.getResourceAsStream()
* processing any file in the web application as a JSP

Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those
files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control
the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along
with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution
possible.

It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port
is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a
defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning
arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31
or later. Users should note that a number of changes were made to the
default AJP Connector configuration in 7.0.100 to harden the default
configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 7.0.100 or later
will need to make small changes to their configurations as a result.

This was fixed with commits

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 3 January
2020. The issue was made public on 24 February 2020.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.99

**Low: HTTP Request Smuggling**
[CVE-2020-1935](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1935)

The HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line (EOL)
parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This
led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was
located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid
Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is
considered unlikely.

This was fixed with commit
[702bf15b](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/702bf15bea292915684d931526d95d4990b2e73d).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by @ZeddYu
on 25 December 2019. The issue was made public on 24
February 2020.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.99

**Low: HTTP Request Smuggling**
[CVE-2019-17569](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17569)

The refactoring in 7.0.98 introduced a regression. The result of the
regression was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were incorrectly
processed leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was
located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid
Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is
considered unlikely.

This was fixed with commit
[b191a0d9](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/b191a0d9cf06f4e04257c221bfe41d2b108a9cc8).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by @ZeddYu
on 12 December 2019. The issue was made public on 24
February 2020.

Affects: 7.0.98 to 7.0.99

### 17 December 2019 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.99

**Low: Session fixation**
[CVE-2019-17563](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17563)

When using FORM authentication there was a narrow window where an
attacker could perform a session fixation attack. The window was
considered too narrow for an exploit to be practical but, erring on the
side of caution, this issue has been treated as a security
vulnerability.

This was fixed with commit
[ab72a106](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/ab72a106fe5d992abddda954e30849d7cf8cc583).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by William
Marlow (IBM) on 19 November 2019. The issue was made public on 18
December 2019.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.98

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.98 but the
release vote for the 7.0.98 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 7.0.99 to obtain a version that includes
the fix for this issue, version78.0.98 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Moderate: Local Privilege Escalation**
[CVE-2019-12418](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12418)

When Tomcat is configured with the JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener, a local
attacker without access to the Tomcat process or configuration files is
able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack
to capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The
attacker can then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and
gain complete control over the Tomcat instance.

The JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener will be deprecated in future Tomcat
releases, will be removed for Tomcat 10 and may be removed from all
Tomcat releases some time after 31 December 2020.

Users should also be aware of [CVE-2019-2684](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-2684), a JRE
vulnerability that enables this issue to be exploited remotely.

This was fixed with commit
[bef3f404](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/bef3f40400243348d12f4abfe9b413f43897c02b).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by An Trinh of
Viettel Cyber Security on 10 October 2019. The issue was made public on 18
December 2019.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.97

### 12 April 2019 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.94

**Important: Remote Code Execution on Windows**
[CVE-2019-0232](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0232)

When running on Windows with enableCmdLineArguments enabled, the CGI
Servlet is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to a bug in the way
the JRE passes command line arguments to Windows. The CGI Servlet is
disabled by default. For a detailed explanation of the JRE behaviour, see
[Markus
Wulftange's blog](https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2016/02/java-and-command-line-injections-in-windows.html) and this archived

This was fixed with commit
[7f0221b9](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/7f0221b904956359f2d739aa3a2b53f8c12ed8c7).

This issue was identified by Nightwatch Cybersecurity Research and
reported to the Apache Tomcat security team via the bug bounty program
sponsored by the EU FOSSA-2 project on 3rd March 2019. The issue was made
public on 10 April 2019.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.93

**Low: XSS in SSI printenv**
[CVE-2019-0221](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0221)

The SSI printenv command echoes user provided data without escaping and
is, therefore, vulnerable to XSS. SSI is disabled by default. The
printenv command is intended for debugging and is unlikely to be present
in a production website.

This was fixed with commit
[44ec74c4](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/44ec74c44dcd05cd7e90967c04d40b51440ecd7e).

This issue was identified by Nightwatch Cybersecurity Research and
reported to the Apache Tomcat security team via the bug bounty program

public on 17 May 2019.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.93

### 19 September 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.91

**Moderate: Open Redirect**
[CVE-2018-11784](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11784)

When the default servlet returned a redirect to a directory (e.g.
redirecting to `/foo/` when the user requested
`/foo`) a specially crafted URL could be used to cause the
redirect to be generated to any URI of the attackers choice.

This was fixed in revision [1840057](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1840057).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by Sergey
Bobrov on 28 August 2018 and made public on 3 October 2018.

Affects: 7.0.23 to 7.0.90

### 7 July 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.90

**Low: host name verification missing in WebSocket client**
[CVE-2018-8034](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8034)

The host name verification when using TLS with the WebSocket client was
missing. It is now enabled by default.

This was fixed in revision [1833760](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1833760).

This issue was reported publicly on 11 June 2018 and formally announced as
a vulnerability on 22 July 2018.

Affects: 7.0.25 to 7.0.88

### not released Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.89

**Low: CORS filter has insecure defaults**
[CVE-2018-8014](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8014)

The defaults settings for the CORS filter are insecure and enable
`supportsCredentials` for all origins. It is expected that
users of the CORS filter will have configured it appropriately for their
environment rather than using it in the default configuration. Therefore,
it is expected that most users will not be impacted by this issue.

This was fixed in revision [1831730](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1831730).

This issue was reported publicly on 1 May 2018 and formally announced as
a vulnerability on 16 May 2018.

### 16 May 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.88

**Important: A bug in the UTF-8 decoder can lead to DoS**
[CVE-2018-1336](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1336)

An improper handing of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder with
supplementary characters can lead to an infinite loop in the
decoder causing a Denial of Service.

This was fixed in revision [1830376](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1830376).

This issue was reported publicly on 6 April 2018 and formally announced as
a vulnerability on 22 July 2018.

Affects: 7.0.28 to 7.0.88

### 13 February 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.85

**Important: Security constraint annotations applied too
late** [CVE-2018-1305](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1305)

Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets were only applied
once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in
this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that point, it was
possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded - for some
security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources
to users who were not authorised to access them.

This was fixed in revisions [1823322](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1823322) and
[1824360](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1824360).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security on 1 February
2018 and made public on 23 February 2018.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.84

**Important: Security constraints mapped to context root are
ignored** [CVE-2018-1304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1304)

The URL pattern of "" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the
context root was not correctly handled when used as part of a security
constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was,
therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web
application resources that should have been protected. Only security
constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.

This was fixed in revision [1823309](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1823309).

This issue was reported publicly as [62067](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62067) on 31 January 2018
and the security implications identified by the Apache Tomcat Security
Team the same day. It was made public on 23 February 2018.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.84

### 24 January 2018 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.84

**Low: Incorrectly documented CGI search algorithm**
[CVE-2017-15706](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15706)

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.83 but the
release vote for the 7.0.83 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 7.0.84 to obtain a version that includes
the fix for this issue, version 7.0.83 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

As part of the fix for bug [61201](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61201), the description of the
search algorithm used by the CGI Servlet to identify which script to
execute was updated. The update was not correct. As a result, some
scripts may have failed to execute as expected and other scripts may have
been executed unexpectedly. Note that the behaviour of the CGI servlet
has remained unchanged in this regard. It is only the documentation of
the behaviour that was wrong and has been corrected.

This was fixed in revision [1814828](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1814828).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by Jan Michael
Greiner on 17 September 2017 and made public on 31 January 2018.

Affects: 7.0.79 to 7.0.82

### 4 October 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.82

**Important: Remote Code Execution**
[CVE-2017-12617](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12617)

When running with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the
`readonly` initialisation parameter of the Default servlet to
false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially
crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it
contained would be executed by the server.

This was fixed in revisions [1809978](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1809978),
[1809992](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1809992),

This issue was first reported publicly followed by multiple reports to
the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 20 September 2017.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.81

### 16 August 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.81

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2017-12616](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12616)

When using a VirtualDirContext it was possible to bypass security
constraints and/or view the source code of JSPs for resources served by
the VirtualDirContext using a specially crafted request.

This was fixed in revision [1804729](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1804729).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat Security Team on 10 August 2017

**Moderate: Cache Poisoning**
[CVE-2017-7674](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7674)

The CORS Filter did not add an HTTP Vary header indicating that the
response varies depending on Origin. This permitted client and server
side cache poisoning in some circumstances.

This was fixed in revision [1795816](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1795816).

The issue was reported as bug [61101](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61101) on 16 May 2017. The full

### 16 May 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.78

**Important: Security Constraint Bypass**
[CVE-2017-5664](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5664)

The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that,
when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the error that
occurred, the original request and response are forwarded to the error
page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the
original HTTP method.

If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve content
of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP
method. Tomcat's Default Servlet did not do this. Depending on the
original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for
static error pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to
permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page.

Notes for other user provided error pages:

* Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP method.
  JSPs used as error pages must ensure that they handle any error
  dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.
* By default, the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the
  HTTP method. Custom Servlets used as error pages must ensure that
  they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the
  actual method.

This was fixed in revisions [1793471](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1793471) and
[1793491](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1793491).

This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by
Aniket Nandkishor Kulkarni from Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Mumbai,
India as a vulnerability that allowed the restrictions on OPTIONS and

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2017-5647](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5647)

A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests when send file was used
resulted in the pipelined request being lost when send file processing of
the previous request completed. This could result in responses appearing
to be sent for the wrong request. For example, a user agent that sent
requests A, B and C could see the correct response for request A, the
response for request C for request B and no response for request C.

This was fixed in revision [1789008](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1789008).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 20
March 2017 and made public on 10 April 2017.

**Low: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2017-5648](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5648)

While investigating bug 60718, it was noticed that some calls to
application listeners did not use the appropriate facade object. When
running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager, it was
therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a reference
to the request or response object and thereby access and/or modify
information associated with another web application.

This was fixed in revision [1785777](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1785777).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 20
March 2017 and made public on 10 April 2017.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.75

### 24 January 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.75

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-8745](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8745)

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.74 but the
release vote for the 7.0.74 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 7.0.75 to obtain a version that includes
the fix for this issue, version 7.0.74 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP
connector resulted in the current Processor object being added to the
Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same
Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can
result in information leakage between requests including, but not limited
to, session ID and the response body.

This was fixed in revision [1777471](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1777471).

This issue was identified as affecting 7.0.x by the Apache Tomcat Security
Team on 3 January 2016 and made public on 5 January 2017.

**Important: Remote Code Execution**
[CVE-2016-8735](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8735)

The `JmxRemoteLifecycleListener` was not updated to take
account of Oracle's fix for [CVE-2016-3427](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3427). Therefore, Tomcat
installations using this listener remained vulnerable to a similar remote
code execution vulnerability. This issue has been rated as important
rather than critical due to the small number of installations using this
listener and that it would be highly unusual for the JMX ports to be
accessible to an attacker even when the listener is used.

This was fixed in revision [1767676](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1767676).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 19 October
2016 and made public on 22 November 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.72

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-6816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816)

The code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters.
This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted
the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject
data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the
attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain
sensitive information from requests other then their own.

This was fixed in revision [1767675](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1767675).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 11
October 2016 and made public on 22 November 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.72

### 19 September 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.72

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.71 but the
release vote for the 7.0.71 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 7.0.72 to obtain a version that includes
fixes for these issues, version 7.0.71 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Low: Unrestricted Access to Global Resources**
[CVE-2016-6797](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6797)

The ResourceLinkFactory did not limit web application access to global
JNDI resources to those resources explicitly linked to the web
application. Therefore, it was possible for a web application to access
any global JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been
configured or not.

This was fixed in revision [1757275](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1757275).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 18
January 2016 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.70

**Low: Security Manager Bypass**
[CVE-2016-6796](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6796)

A malicious web application was able to bypass a configured
SecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration parameters for the
JSP Servlet.

This was fixed in revisions [1758495](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1758495) and
[1763236](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1763236).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 27
December 2015 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.70

**Low: System Property Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-6794](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6794)

When a SecurityManager is configured, a web application's ability to read
system properties should be controlled by the SecurityManager. Tomcat's
system property replacement feature for configuration files could be used
by a malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager and read
system properties that should not be visible.

This was fixed in revision [1754728](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1754728).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 27
December 2015 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.70

**Low: Security Manager Bypass**
[CVE-2016-5018](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5018)

A malicious web application was able to bypass a configured
SecurityManager via a Tomcat utility method that was accessible to web
applications.

This was fixed in revisions [1754902](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1754902) and
[1760309](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1760309).

This issue was discovered by Alvaro Munoz and Alexander Mirosh of the HP
Enterprise Security Team and reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team
on 5 July 2016. It was made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.70

**Low: Timing Attack**
[CVE-2016-0762](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0762)

The Realm implementations did not process the supplied password if the
supplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to
determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration includes
the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability
harder.

This was fixed in revision [1758502](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1758502).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 1 January
2016 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.70

### 20 June 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.70

**Moderate: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2016-3092](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3092)

Apache Tomcat uses a package renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload to
implement the file upload requirements of the Servlet specification. A
denial of service vulnerability was identified in Commons FileUpload that
occurred when the length of the multipart boundary was just below the
size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file. This
caused the file upload process to take several orders of magnitude
longer than if the boundary was the typical tens of bytes long.

This was fixed in revision [1743742](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1743742).

This issue was identified by the TERASOLUNA Framework Development Team
and reported to the Apache Commons team via JPCERT on 9 May 2016. It was
made public on 21 June 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.69

### 16 February 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.68

**Low: Directory disclosure**
[CVE-2015-5345](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5345)

When accessing a directory protected by a security constraint with a URL
that did not end in a slash, Tomcat would redirect to the URL with the
trailing slash thereby confirming the presence of the directory before
processing the security constraint. It was therefore possible for a user
to determine if a directory existed or not, even if the user was not
permitted to view the directory. The issue also occurred at the root of a
web application in which case the presence of the web application was
confirmed, even if a user did not have access.

The solution was to implement the redirect in the DefaultServlet so that
any security constraints and/or security enforcing Filters were processed
before the redirect. The Tomcat team recognised that moving the redirect
could cause regressions so two new Context configuration options
(`mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled` and
`mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled`) were introduced. The initial
default was `false` for both since this was more secure.
However, due to regressions such as
[Bug
58765](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58765) the default for `mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled`
was later changed to true since it was viewed that the regression was
more serious than the security risk associated with being able to
determine if a web application was deployed at a given path.

This was fixed in revisions [1715213](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1715213),
[1716860](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1716860) and
[1717212](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1717212).

This issue was identified by Mark Koek of QCSec on 12 October 2015 and
made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.67

**Moderate: CSRF token leak**
[CVE-2015-5351](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5351)

The index page of the Manager and Host Manager applications included a
valid CSRF token when issuing a redirect as a result of an
unauthenticated request to the root of the web application. If an
attacker had access to the Manager or Host Manager applications
(typically these applications are only accessible to internal users, not
exposed to the Internet), this token could then be used by the attacker
to construct a CSRF attack.

This was fixed in revisions [1720661](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1720661) and
[1720663](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1720663).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 8 December 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 7.0.1 to 7.0.67

**Low: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2016-0706](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0706)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

The internal StatusManagerServlet could be loaded by a malicious web
application when a security manager was configured. This servlet could
then provide the malicious web application with a list of all deployed
applications and a list of the HTTP request lines for all requests
currently being processed. This could have exposed sensitive information
from other web applications, such as session IDs, to the web
application.

This was fixed in revision [1722801](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1722801).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 December 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.67

**Moderate: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2016-0714](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0714)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

Tomcat provides several session persistence mechanisms. The
`StandardManager` persists session over a restart. The
`PersistentManager` is able to persist sessions to files, a
database or a custom `Store`. The cluster implementation
persists sessions to one or more additional nodes in the cluster. All of
these mechanisms could be exploited to bypass a security manager. Session
persistence is performed by Tomcat code with the permissions assigned to
Tomcat internal code. By placing a carefully crafted object into a
session, a malicious web application could trigger the execution of
arbitrary code.

This was fixed in revisions [1726923](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1726923) and
[1727034](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1727034).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 November 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.67

**Moderate: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2016-0763](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0763)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

`ResourceLinkFactory.setGlobalContext()` is a public method
and was accessible to web applications even when running under a security
manager. This allowed a malicious web application to inject a malicious
global context that could in turn be used to disrupt other web
applications and/or read and write data owned by other web
applications.

This was fixed in revision [1725931](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1725931).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 18 January 2016
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.67

### 10 December 2015 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.67

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.66 but the
release vote for the 7.0.66 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 7.0.67 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for this issue, version 7.0.66 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Low: Session Fixation**
[CVE-2015-5346](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5346)

When recycling the `Request` object to use for a new request,
the `requestedSessionSSL` field was not recycled. This meant that
a session ID provided in the next request to be processed using the recycled
`Request` object could be used when it should not have been. This
gave the client the ability to control the session ID. In theory, this could
have been used as part of a session fixation attack but it would have been
hard to achieve as the attacker would not have been able to force the victim
to use the 'correct' `Request` object. It was also necessary for
at least one web application to be configured to use the SSL session ID as
the HTTP session ID. This is not a common configuration.

This was fixed in revision [1713187](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1713187).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 22 June 2014
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 7.0.5 to 7.0.65

### 19 October 2015 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.65

**Low: Limited directory traversal**
[CVE-2015-5174](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5174)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

When accessing resources via the `ServletContext` methods
`getResource()` `getResourceAsStream()` and
`getResourcePaths()` the paths should be limited to the
current web application. The validation was not correct and paths of the
form `"/.."` were not rejected. Note that paths starting with
`"/../"` were correctly rejected. This bug allowed malicious
web applications running under a security manager to obtain a directory
listing for the directory in which the web application had been deployed.
This should not be possible when running under a security manager.
Typically, the directory listing that would be exposed would be for
`$CATALINA_BASE/webapps.`

This was fixed in revisions [1696284](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1696284) and
[1700898](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1700898).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 August 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.64

### 4 February 2015 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.59

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.58 but the
release vote for the 7.0.58 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 7.0.59 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for this issue, versions 7.0.58 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Moderate: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2014-7810](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7810)

Malicious web applications could use expression language to bypass the
protections of a Security Manager as expressions were evaluated within a
privileged code section.

This was fixed in revisions [1644019](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1644019) and
[1645644](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1645644).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 2 November 2014
and made public on 14 May 2015.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.57

### 27 July 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.55

**Important: Request Smuggling**
[CVE-2014-0227](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0227)

It was possible to craft a malformed chunk as part of a chunked request
that caused Tomcat to read part of the request body as a new request.

This was fixed in revision [1601333](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1601333).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 30 May 2014
and made public on 9 February 2015.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.54

**Low: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0230](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0230)

When a response for a request with a request body is returned to the user
agent before the request body is fully read, by default Tomcat swallows the
remaining request body so that the next request on the connection may be
processed. There was no limit to the size of request body that Tomcat would
swallow. This permitted a limited Denial of Service as Tomcat would never
close the connection and a processing thread would remain allocated to the
connection.

This was fixed in revision [1603781](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1603781)
and improved in revisions [1603811](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1603811),
[1609176](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1609176) and
[1659295](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1659295).

This issue was disclosed to the Tomcat security team by AntBean@secdig
from the Baidu Security Team on 4 June 2014 and made public on 9 April
2015.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.54

### released 22 May 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.54

**Low: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0119](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0119)

In limited circumstances it was possible for a malicious web application
to replace the XML parsers used by Tomcat to process XSLTs for the
default servlet, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs) and tag
plugin configuration files. The injected XML parser(s) could then bypass
the limits imposed on XML external entities and/or have visibility of the
XML files processed for other web applications deployed on the same
Tomcat instance.

This was fixed in revisions [1588199](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1588199),
[1589997](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1589997),

[1590036](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1590036).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 April 2014
and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.53

### released 30 Mar 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.53

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0075](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0075)

It was possible to craft a malformed chunk size as part of a chucked
request that enabled an unlimited amount of data to be streamed to the
server, bypassing the various size limits enforced on a request. This
enabled a denial of service attack.

This was fixed in revision [1578341](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1578341).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat security team by David Jorm of the
Red Hat Security Response Team on 28 February 2014 and made public on 27
May 2014.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.52

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0096)

The default servlet allows web applications to define (at multiple
levels) an XSLT to be used to format a directory listing. When running
under a security manager, the processing of these was not subject to the
same constraints as the web application. This enabled a malicious web
application to bypass the file access constraints imposed by the security
manager via the use of external XML entities.

This was fixed in revisions [1578637](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1578637) and
[1578655](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1578655).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 February 2014
and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.52

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0099](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0099)

The code used to parse the request content length header did not check
for overflow in the result. This exposed a request smuggling
vulnerability when Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that
correctly processed the content length header.

This was fixed in revision [1578814](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1578814).

A test case that demonstrated the parsing bug was sent to the Tomcat
security team on 13 March 2014 but no context was provided. The security
implications were identified by the Tomcat security team the day the
report was received and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.52

### released 17 Feb 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.52

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.51 but the
release vote for the 7.0.51 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 7.0.52 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for this issue, version 7.0.51 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0050](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0050)

It was possible to craft a malformed Content-Type header for a multipart
request that caused Apache Tomcat to enter an infinite loop. A malicious
user could, therefore, craft a malformed request that triggered a denial
of service.

The root cause of this error was a bug in Apache Commons FileUpload.
Tomcat 7 uses a packaged renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload to
implement the requirement of the Servlet 3.0 specification to support the
processing of mime-multipart requests. Tomcat 7 was therefore affected by
this issue.

This was fixed in revision [1565169](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1565169).

This issue was reported to the Apache Software Foundation on 04 Feb 2014
and accidently made public on 06 Feb 2014.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.50

### released 08 Jan 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.50

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.48 but the
release votes for 7.0.48 to 7.0.49 did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 7.0.50 to obtain a version
that includes fixes for these issues, versions 7.0.48 to 7.0.49 are
not included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2013-4322](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4322)

The fix for CVE-2012-3544 was not complete. It did not cover the
following cases:

* chunk extensions were not limited
* whitespace after the : in a trailing header was not limited

This was fixed in revisions [1521864](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1521864) and
[1549523](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1549523).

The first part of this issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security
team on 27 August 2013 and the second part by Saran Neti of TELUS
Security Labs on 5 November 2013. It was made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.47

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2013-4590](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4590)

Application provided XML files such as web.xml, context.xml, \*.tld,
\*.tagx and \*.jspx allowed XXE which could be used to expose Tomcat
internals to an attacker. This vulnerability only occurs when Tomcat is
running web applications from untrusted sources such as in a shared
hosting environment.

This was fixed in revision [1549529](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1549529).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team on 29
October 2013 and made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.47

### released 24 Oct 2013 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.47

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.43 but the
release votes for 7.0.43 to 7.0.46 did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 7.0.47 to obtain a version
that includes a fix for this issue, versions 7.0.43 to 7.0.46 are not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2013-4286](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4286)

The fix for CVE-2005-2090 was not complete. It did not cover the
following cases:

* content-length header with chunked encoding over any HTTP connector
* multiple content-length headers over any AJP connector

Requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length
header when chunked encoding is being used should be rejected as invalid.
When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat) process
a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain either multiple
content-length headers or a content-length header when chunked encoding
is being used and several components do not reject the request and make
different decisions as to which content-length header to use an attacker
can poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and obtain sensitive
information from requests other then their own. Tomcat now rejects
requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length
header when chunked encoding is being used.

This was fixed in revision [1521854](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1521854).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team on 15 August
2013 and made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.42

### released 9 May 2013 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.40

**Moderate: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2013-2071](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2071)

Bug [54178](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54178) described a scenario where elements of a previous
request may be exposed to a current request. This was very difficult to
exploit deliberately but fairly likely to happen unexpectedly if an
application used AsyncListeners that threw RuntimeExceptions.

This was fixed in revision [1471372](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1471372).

The root cause of the problem was identified as a Tomcat bug on 2 April
2013. The Tomcat security team identified the security implications on
24 April 2013 and made those details public on 10 May 2013.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.39

**Important: Remote Code Execution**
[CVE-2013-4444](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4444)

In very limited circumstances, it was possible for an attacker to upload
a malicious JSP to a Tomcat server and then trigger the execution of that
JSP. While Remote Code Execution would normally be viewed as a critical
vulnerability, the circumstances under which this is possible are, in the
view of the Tomcat security team, sufficiently limited that this
vulnerability is viewed as important.

For this attack to succeed all of the following requirements must be
met:

1. Using Oracle Java 1.7.0 update 25 or earlier (or any other Java
   implementation where java.io.File is vulnerable to null byte
   injection).
2. A web application must be deployed to a vulnerable version of
   Tomcat.
3. The web application must use the Servlet 3.0 File Upload feature.
4. A file location within a deployed web application must be writeable by
   the user the Tomcat process is running as. The Tomcat security
   documentation recommends against this.
5. A custom listener for JMX connections (e.g. the JmxRemoteListener that
   is not enabled by default) must be configured and be able to load
   classes from Tomcat's common class loader (i.e. the custom JMX
   listener must be placed in Tomcat's lib directory).
6. The custom JMX listener must be bound to an address other than
   localhost for a remote attack (it is bound to localhost by default).
   If the custom JMX listener is bound to localhost, a local attack will
   still be possible.

Note that requirements 2 and 3 may be replaced with the following
requirement:

7. A web application is deployed that uses Apache Commons File Upload
   1.2.1 or earlier.

In this case (requirements 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 met) a similar vulnerability
may exist on any Servlet container, not just Apache Tomcat.

This was fixed in revision [1470437](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1470437).

This issue was identified by Pierre Ernst of the VMware Security
Engineering, Communications and Response group (vSECR) and reported to
the Tomcat security team via the Pivotal security team on 5 September
2014. It was made public on 10 September 2014.

Affects: 7.0.0 to 7.0.39

### released 21 Nov 2012 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.33

**Important: Session fixation**
[CVE-2013-2067](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2067)

FORM authentication associates the most recent request requiring
authentication with the current session. By repeatedly sending a request
for an authenticated resource while the victim is completing the login
form, an attacker could inject a request that would be executed using
the victim's credentials.

This was fixed in revision [1408044](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1408044).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 15 Oct 2012 and
made public on 10 May 2013.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.32

### released 9 Oct 2012 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.32

**Important: Bypass of CSRF prevention filter**
[CVE-2012-4431](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4431)

The CSRF prevention filter could be bypassed if a request was made to a
protected resource without a session identifier present in the request.

This was fixed in revision [1393088](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1393088).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 8 September 2012
and made public on 4 December 2012.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.31

### released 6 Sep 2012 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.30

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-3544](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3544)

When processing a request submitted using the chunked transfer encoding,
Tomcat ignored but did not limit any extensions that were included. This
allows a client to perform a limited DOS by streaming an unlimited
amount of data to the server.

This was fixed in revisions [1378702](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1378702) and
[1378921](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1378921).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat security team on 10 November 2011
and made public on 10 May 2013.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.29

**Moderate: DIGEST authentication weakness**
[CVE-2012-3439](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3439)

Three weaknesses in Tomcat's implementation of DIGEST authentication
were identified and resolved:

1. Tomcat tracked client rather than server nonces and nonce count.
2. When a session ID was present, authentication was bypassed.
3. The user name and password were not checked before when indicating
   that a nonce was stale.

These issues reduced the security of DIGEST authentication making
replay attacks possible in some circumstances.

This was fixed in revision [1377807](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1377807).

The first issue was reported by Tilmann Kuhn to the Tomcat security team
on 19 July 2012. The second and third issues were discovered by the
Tomcat security team during the resulting code review. All three issues
were made public on 5 November 2012.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.29

**Important: Bypass of security constraints**
[CVE-2012-3546](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3546)

When using FORM authentication it was possible to bypass the security
constraint checks in the FORM authenticator by appending
`/j_security_check` to the end of the URL if some other
component (such as the Single-Sign-On valve) had called
`request.setUserPrincipal()` before the call to
`FormAuthenticator#authenticate()`.

This was fixed in revision [1377892](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1377892).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 13 July 2012 and
made public on 4 December 2012.

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-2733](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2733)

The checks that limited the permitted size of request headers were
implemented too late in the request parsing process for the HTTP NIO
connector. This enabled a malicious user to trigger an
OutOfMemoryError by sending a single request with very large headers.

This was fixed in revision [1350301](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1350301).

This was reported by Josh Spiewak to the Tomcat security team on 4 June
2012 and made public on 5 November 2012.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.27

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-4534](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4534)

When using the NIO connector with sendfile and HTTPS enabled, if a client
breaks the connection while reading the response an infinite loop is
entered leading to a denial of service. This was originally reported as
[bug
52858](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52858).

This was fixed in revision [1340218](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1340218).

The security implications of this bug were reported to the Tomcat
security team by Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team on
3 October 2012 and made public on 4 December 2012.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.27

### released 25 Nov 2011 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.23

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-0022](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0022)

Analysis of the recent hash collision vulnerability identified unrelated
inefficiencies with Apache Tomcat's handling of large numbers of
parameters and parameter values. These inefficiencies could allow an
attacker, via a specially crafted request, to cause large amounts of CPU
to be used which in turn could create a denial of service. The issue was
addressed by modifying the Tomcat parameter handling code to efficiently
process large numbers of parameters and parameter values.

This was fixed in revisions [1189899](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1189899),
[1190372](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1190372),

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-3375](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3375)

For performance reasons, information parsed from a request is often
cached in two places: the internal request object and the internal
processor object. These objects are not recycled at exactly the same
time. When certain errors occur that needed to be added to the access
log, the access logging process triggers the re-population of the request
object after it has been recycled. However, the request object was not
recycled before being used for the next request. That lead to information
leakage (e.g. remote IP address, HTTP headers) from the previous request
to the next request. The issue was resolved be ensuring that the request
and response objects were recycled after being re-populated to generate
the necessary access log entries.

This was fixed in [revision 1176592](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1176592).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 22 September 2011 and
made public on 17 January 2012.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.21

**Low: Privilege Escalation**
[CVE-2011-3376](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3376)

This issue only affects environments running web applications that are
not trusted (e.g. shared hosting environments). The Servlets that
implement the functionality of the Manager application that ships with
Apache Tomcat should only be available to Contexts (web applications)
that are marked as privileged. However, this check was not being made.
This allowed an untrusted web application to use the functionality of the
Manager application. This could be used to obtain information on running
web applications as well as deploying additional web applications.

This was fixed in [revision 1176588](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1176588).

This was identified by Ate Douma on 27 September 2011 and made public
on 8 November 2011.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.21

**Important: Authentication bypass and information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-3190](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3190)

Apache Tomcat supports the AJP protocol which is used with reverse
proxies to pass requests and associated data about the request from the
reverse proxy to Tomcat. The AJP protocol is designed so that when a
request includes a request body, an unsolicited AJP message is sent to
Tomcat that includes the first part (or possibly all) of the request
body. In certain circumstances, Tomcat did not process this message as a
request body but as a new request. This permitted an attacker to have
full control over the AJP message permitting authentication bypass and
information disclosure. This vulnerability only occurs when all of the
following are true:

* The org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler AJP connector is not used
* POST requests are accepted
* The request body is not processed

This was fixed in [revision 1162958](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1162958).

This was reported publicly on 20th August 2011.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.20

Mitigation options:

* Upgrade to Tomcat 7.0.21
* Apply the appropriate [patch](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1162958)
* Configure both Tomcat and the reverse proxy to use a shared secret.

  (It is "`requiredSecret`" attribute in AJP <Connector>,
  "`worker.workername.secret`" directive for mod\_jk.
  The mod\_proxy\_ajp module currently does not support shared secrets).

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2729](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2729)

Due to a bug in the capabilities code, jsvc (the service wrapper for
Linux that is part of the Commons Daemon project) does not drop
capabilities allowing the application to access files and directories
owned by superuser. This vulnerability only occurs when all of the
following are true:

* Tomcat is running on a Linux operating system
* jsvc was compiled with libcap
* -user parameter is used

Affected Tomcat versions shipped with source files for jsvc that included
this vulnerability.

This was fixed in [revision 1153379](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1153379).

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2526)

Tomcat provides support for sendfile with the HTTP NIO and HTTP APR
connectors. sendfile is used automatically for content served via the
DefaultServlet and deployed web applications may use it directly via
setting request attributes. These request attributes were not validated.
When running under a security manager, this lack of validation allowed a
malicious web application to do one or more of the following that would
normally be prevented by a security manager:

* return files to users that the security manager should make
  inaccessible
* terminate (via a crash) the JVM

Additionally, these vulnerabilities only occur when all of the following
are true:

* untrusted web applications are being used
* the SecurityManager is used to limit the untrusted web applications
* the HTTP NIO or HTTP APR connector is used
* sendfile is enabled for the connector (this is the default)

[CVE-2011-2204](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2204)

When using the MemoryUserDatabase (based on tomcat-users.xml) and
creating users via JMX, an exception during the user creation process may
trigger an error message in the JMX client that includes the user's
password. This error message is also written to the Tomcat logs. User
passwords are visible to administrators with JMX access and/or
administrators with read access to the tomcat-users.xml file. Users that
do not have these permissions but are able to read log files may be able
to discover a user's password.

The re-factoring of XML validation for Tomcat 7.0.x re-introduced the
vulnerability previously reported as [CVE-2009-0783](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0783).
This was initially
[reported](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51395) as a memory leak. If a web application is the first web
application loaded, this bugs allows that web application to potentially
view and/or alter the web.xml, context.xml and tld files of other web
applications deployed on the Tomcat instance.

This was first fixed in
[revision 1137753](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1137753),
but reverted in [revision 1138776](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1138776) and

An error in the fixes for CVE-2011-1088/CVE-2011-1183 meant that security
constraints configured via annotations were ignored on the first request
to a Servlet. Subsequent requests were secured correctly.

This was fixed in [revision 1100832](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1100832).

[CVE-2011-1475](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1475)

Changes introduced to the HTTP BIO connector to support Servlet 3.0
asynchronous requests did not fully account for HTTP pipelining. As a
result, when using HTTP pipelining a range of unexpected behaviours
occurred including the mixing up of responses between requests. While
the mix-up in responses was only observed between requests from the same
user, a mix-up of responses for requests from different users may also be
possible.

This was fixed in revisions [1086349](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1086349) and
[1086352](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1086352).
(Note: HTTP pipelined requests are still likely to fail with the
HTTP BIO connector but will do so in a secure manner.)

This was reported publicly on the Tomcat Bugzilla issue tracker on 22 Mar
2011.

**Moderate: Multiple weaknesses in HTTP DIGEST authentication**
[CVE-2011-1184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1184)

Note: Mitre elected to break this issue down into multiple issues and
have allocated the following additional references to parts of this
issue:
[CVE-2011-5062](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5062),
[CVE-2011-5063](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5063) and
[CVE-2011-5064](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5064). The Apache Tomcat security team will
continue to treat this as a single issue using the reference
[CVE-2011-1184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1184).

The implementation of HTTP DIGEST authentication was discovered to have
several weaknesses:

* replay attacks were permitted
* server nonces were not checked
* client nonce counts were not checked
* qop values were not checked
* realm values were not checked
* the server secret was hard-coded to a known string

The result of these weaknesses is that DIGEST authentication was only as
secure as BASIC authentication.

This was fixed in [revision 1087655](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1087655).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 16 March 2011 and

A regression in the fix for CVE-2011-1088 meant that security constraints
were ignored when no login configuration was present in the web.xml and
the web application was marked as meta-data complete.

This was fixed in [revision 1087643](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1087643).

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.4

### released 21 Oct 2010 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.4

**Low: SecurityManager file permission bypass**
[CVE-2010-3718](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3718)

When running under a SecurityManager, access to the file system is
limited but web applications are granted read/write permissions to the
work directory. This directory is used for a variety of temporary files
such as the intermediate files generated when compiling JSPs to Servlets.
The location of the work directory is specified by a ServletContect
attribute that is meant to be read-only to web applications. However,
due to a coding error, the read-only setting was not applied. Therefore,
a malicious web application may modify the attribute before Tomcat
applies the file permissions. This can be used to grant read/write
permissions to any area on the file system which a malicious web
application may then take advantage of. This vulnerability is only
applicable when hosting web applications from untrusted sources such as
shared hosting environments.

This was fixed in [revision 1022134](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1022134).

This was discovered by the Tomcat security team on 12 Oct 2010 and
made public on 5 Feb 2011.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.3

### released 11 Aug 2010 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.2

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.1 but the
release vote for the 7.0.1 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 7.0.2 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for this issue, version 7.0.2 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service and Information Disclosure
Vulnerability**
[CVE-2010-2227](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2227)

Several flaws in the handling of the 'Transfer-Encoding' header were
found that prevented the recycling of a buffer. A remote attacker could
trigger this flaw which would cause subsequent requests to fail and/or
information to leak between requests. This flaw is mitigated if Tomcat is
behind a reverse proxy (such as Apache httpd 2.2) as the proxy should
reject the invalid transfer encoding header.

This was fixed in [revision 958911](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=958911).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 14 Jun 2010 and
made public on 9 Jul 2010.

Affects: 7.0.0

### Not a vulnerability in Tomcat

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2017-6056](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6056)

In February 2015 a single user reported high CPU usage ([57544](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57544))
which was traced to a tight loop. However, it was not clear how the
conditions necessary to enter the loop were being created. There was no
evidence that indicated that the loop was user triggerable. The only
potential paths identified by code inspection depended on application
bugs (retaining references to request objects and accessing after the
request had completed).

It was (and still is) believed that an application bug was the most
likely root cause. Therefore, [57544](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57544) was not treated as a DoS
vulnerability.

In November 2016, [CVE-2016-6816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816) was announced. When downstream
distributions, notably Debian, back-ported the fix for
[CVE-2016-6816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816) they inadvertently make it trivial for users to
trigger the tight loop from [57544](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57544). This made a DoS attack
trivial to mount and resulted in multiple reports of problems including
[60578](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60578) and [60581](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60581).

Tomcat releases from the Apache Software Foundation were not affected as
the ASF did not release any versions that contained the fix for
[CVE-2016-6816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816) but not the fix for [57544](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57544).

This issue was first announced on 13 February 2017.

Affects: Debian, Ubuntu and potentially other downstream
distributions.

**Low: Denial Of Service**
[CVE-2012-5568](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5568)

Sending an HTTP request 1 byte at a time will consume a thread from the
connection pool until the request has been fully processed if using the
BIO or APR/native HTTP connectors. Multiple requests may be used to
consume all threads in the connection pool thereby creating a denial of
service.

Since the relationship between the client side resources and server side
resources is a linear one, this issue is not something that the Tomcat
Security Team views as a vulnerability. This is a generic DoS problem and
there is no magic solution. This issue has been discussed several times
on the Tomcat mailing lists. The best place to start to review these
discussions is the report for
[bug
54236](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54263).

This was first discussed on the public Tomcat users mailing list on 19
June 2009.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.x

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service**
[CVE-2010-4476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4476)

A JVM bug could cause Double conversion to hang JVM when accessing to a
form based security constrained page or any page that calls
javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getLocale() or
javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getLocales(). A specially crafted request
can be used to trigger a denial of service.

A work-around for this JVM bug was provided in
[revision 1066244](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1066244).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 01 Feb 2011 and
made public on 31 Jan 2011.

Affects: 7.0.0-7.0.6

**Moderate: TLS SSL Man In The Middle**
[CVE-2009-3555](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555)

A vulnerability exists in the TLS protocol that allows an attacker to
inject arbitrary requests into an TLS stream during renegotiation.

The TLS implementation used by Tomcat varies with connector. The blocking
IO (BIO) and non-blocking (NIO) connectors use the JSSE implementation
provided by the JVM. The APR/native connector uses OpenSSL.

The BIO connector is vulnerable if the JSSE version used is vulnerable.
To workaround a vulnerable version of JSSE, use the connector attribute
`allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation`. It should be set to
`false` (the default) to protect against this vulnerability.

The NIO connector prior to 7.0.10 is not vulnerable as it does not
support renegotiation.

The NIO connector is vulnerable from version 7.0.10 onwards if the JSSE
version used is vulnerable. To workaround a vulnerable version of JSSE,
use the connector attribute `allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation`.
It should be set to `false` (the default) to protect against
this vulnerability.

The APR/native workarounds are detailed on the
[APR/native connector security page](security-native.html).

Users should be aware that the impact of disabling renegotiation will
vary with both application and client. In some circumstances disabling
renegotiation may result in some clients being unable to access the
application.

This was worked-around in
[revision 891292](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=882320).

Support for the new TLS renegotiation protocol (RFC 5746) that does not
have this security issue:

* For connectors using JSSE implementation provided by JVM:
  Added in Tomcat 7.0.8.

  Requires JRE that supports RFC 5746. For Oracle JRE that is
  [known](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/tlsreadme2-176330.html)
  to be 6u22 or later.
* For connectors using APR and OpenSSL:

  TBD. See
  [APR/native connector security page](security-native.html).

**Important: Remote Memory Read**
[CVE-2014-0160](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160) (a.k.a. "Heartbleed")

A bug in certain versions of [OpenSSL](www.openssl.org)
can allow an unauthenticated remote user to read certain contents of
the server's memory. Binary versions of tcnative 1.1.24 - 1.1.29
include this vulnerable version of OpenSSL. tcnative 1.1.30 and later
ship with patched versions of OpenSSL.

This issue was first announced on 7 April 2014.

Affects: OpenSSL 1.0.1-1.0.1f, tcnative 1.1.24-1.1.29

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Apache Tomcat 6.x vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat® 6.x. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
version with a question mark.

**Note:** Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.

**Please note that Tomcat 6.0.x has reached
[end of life](tomcat-60-eol.html) and is no longer supported.
Further vulnerabilities in the 6.0.x branch will not be fixed. Users
should upgrade to 8.5.x or later to obtain security fixes.**

Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to
apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the
Apache Tomcat version that you are using. For Tomcat 6.0 those are
[`building.html`](/tomcat-6.0-doc/building.html) and
[`BUILDING.txt`](/tomcat-6.0-doc/BUILDING.txt).
Both files can be found in the `webapps/docs` subdirectory
of a binary distributive.

If you need help on building or configuring Tomcat or other help on
following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed
here, please send your questions to the public
[Tomcat Users mailing list](lists.html)

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other
unexpected behaviour that has [security
impact](security-impact.html), or if the descriptions here are incomplete,
please report them privately to the
[Tomcat Security Team](security.html). Thank you.

### 7 April 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.53

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2017-5647](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5647)

A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests when send file was used
resulted in the pipelined request being lost when send file processing of
the previous request completed. This could result in responses appearing
to be sent for the wrong request. For example, a user agent that sent
requests A, B and C could see the correct response for request A, the
response for request C for request B and no response for request C.

This was fixed in revisions [1789024](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1789024),
[1789155](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1789155)
and [1789856](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1789856).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 20
March 2017 and made public on 10 April 2017.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.52

### not yet released Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.50

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.49 but the
release vote for the 6.0.49 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 6.0.50 to obtain a version that includes
the fix for this issue, version 6.0.49 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-8745](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8745)

A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP
connector resulted in the current Processor object being added to the
Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same
Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can
result in information leakage between requests including, but not limited
to, session ID and the response body.

This was fixed in revision [1777472](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1777472).

This issue was identified as affecting 6.0.x by the Apache Tomcat Security
Team on 3 January 2016 and made public on 5 January 2017.

Affects: 6.0.16 to 6.0.48

### 15 November 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.48

**Important: Remote Code Execution**
[CVE-2016-8735](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8735)

The `JmxRemoteLifecycleListener` was not updated to take
account of Oracle's fix for [CVE-2016-3427](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3427). Therefore, Tomcat
installations using this listener remained vulnerable to a similar remote
code execution vulnerability. This issue has been rated as important
rather than critical due to the small number of installations using this
listener and that it would be highly unusual for the JMX ports to be
accessible to an attacker even when the listener is used.

This was fixed in revision [1767684](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1767684).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 19 October
2016 and made public on 22 November 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.47

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-6816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816)

The code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters.
This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted
the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject
data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the
attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain
sensitive information from requests other then their own.

This was fixed in revision [1767683](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1767683).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 11
October 2016 and made public on 22 November 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.47

### 16 October 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.47

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.46 but the
release vote for the 6.0.46 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 6.0.47 to obtain a version that includes
fixes for these issues, version 6.0.46 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Low: Unrestricted Access to Global Resources**
[CVE-2016-6797](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6797)

The ResourceLinkFactory did not limit web application access to global
JNDI resources to those resources explicitly linked to the web
application. Therefore, it was possible for a web application to access
any global JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been
configured or not.

This was fixed in revision [1757285](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1757285).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 18
January 2016 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.45

**Low: Security Manager Bypass**
[CVE-2016-6796](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6796)

A malicious web application was able to bypass a configured
SecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration parameters for the
JSP Servlet.

This was fixed in revisions [1758496](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1758496) and
[1763237](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1763237).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 27
December 2015 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.45

**Low: System Property Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-6794](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6794)

When a SecurityManager is configured, a web application's ability to read
system properties should be controlled by the SecurityManager. Tomcat's
system property replacement feature for configuration files could be used
by a malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager and read
system properties that should not be visible.

This was fixed in revision [1754733](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1754733).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 27
December 2015 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.45

**Low: Security Manager Bypass**
[CVE-2016-5018](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5018)

A malicious web application was able to bypass a configured
SecurityManager via a Tomcat utility method that was accessible to web
applications.

This was fixed in revisions [1754904](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1754904) and
[1761718](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1761718).

This issue was discovered by Alvaro Munoz and Alexander Mirosh of the HP
Enterprise Security Team and reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team
on 5 July 2016. It was made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.45

**Low: Timing Attack**
[CVE-2016-0762](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0762)

The Realm implementations did not process the supplied password if the
supplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to
determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration includes
the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability
harder.

This was fixed in revision [1758506](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1758506).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 1 January
2016 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.45

### 11 February 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.45

**Low: Limited directory traversal**
[CVE-2015-5174](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5174)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

When accessing resources via the `ServletContext` methods
`getResource()` `getResourceAsStream()` and
`getResourcePaths()` the paths should be limited to the
current web application. The validation was not correct and paths of the
form `"/.."` were not rejected. Note that paths starting with
`"/../"` were correctly rejected. This bug allowed malicious
web applications running under a security manager to obtain a directory
listing for the directory in which the web application had been deployed.
This should not be possible when running under a security manager.
Typically, the directory listing that would be exposed would be for
`$CATALINA_BASE/webapps.`

This was fixed in revision [1700900](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1700900).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 August 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.44

**Low: Directory disclosure**
[CVE-2015-5345](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5345)

When accessing a directory protected by a security constraint with a URL
that did not end in a slash, Tomcat would redirect to the URL with the
trailing slash thereby confirming the presence of the directory before
processing the security constraint. It was therefore possible for a user
to determine if a directory existed or not, even if the user was not
permitted to view the directory. The issue also occurred at the root of a
web application in which case the presence of the web application was
confirmed, even if a user did not have access.

The solution was to implement the redirect in the DefaultServlet so that
any security constraints and/or security enforcing Filters were processed
before the redirect. The Tomcat team recognised that moving the redirect
could cause regressions so two new Context configuration options
(`mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled` and
`mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled`) were introduced. The initial
default was `false` for both since this was more secure.
However, due to regressions such as
[Bug
58765](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58765) the default for `mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled`
was later changed to true since it was viewed that the regression was
more serious than the security risk of associated with being able to
determine if a web application was deployed at a given path.

This was fixed in revisions [1715216](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1715216) and
[1717216](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1717216).

This issue was identified by Mark Koek of QCSec on 12 October 2015 and
made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.44

**Low: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2016-0706](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0706)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

The internal StatusManagerServlet could be loaded by a malicious web
application when a security manager was configured. This servlet could
then provide the malicious web application with a list of all deployed
applications and a list of the HTTP request lines for all requests
currently being processed. This could have exposed sensitive information
from other web applications, such as session IDs, to the web
application.

This was fixed in revision [1722802](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1722802).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 December 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.44

**Moderate: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2016-0714](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0714)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

Tomcat provides several session persistence mechanisms. The
`StandardManager` persists session over a restart. The
`PersistentManager` is able to persist sessions to files, a
database or a custom `Store`. The cluster implementation
persists sessions to one or more additional nodes in the cluster. All of
these mechanisms could be exploited to bypass a security manager. Session
persistence is performed by Tomcat code with the permissions assigned to
Tomcat internal code. By placing a carefully crafted object into a
session, a malicious web application could trigger the execution of
arbitrary code.

This was fixed in revisions [1727166](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1727166) and
[1727182](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1727182).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 November 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.44

### 12 May 2015 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.44

**Low: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0230](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0230)

When a response for a request with a request body is returned to the user
agent before the request body is fully read, by default Tomcat swallows the
remaining request body so that the next request on the connection may be
processed. There was no limit to the size of request body that Tomcat would
swallow. This permitted a limited Denial of Service as Tomcat would never
close the connection and a processing thread would remain allocated to the
connection.

This was fixed in revision [1659537](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1659537).

This issue was disclosed to the Tomcat security team by AntBean@secdig
from the Baidu Security Team on 4 June 2014 and made public on 9 April
2015.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.43

**Moderate: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2014-7810](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7810)

Malicious web applications could use expression language to bypass the
protections of a Security Manager as expressions were evaluated within a
privileged code section.

This was fixed in revisions [1645366](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1645366) and
[1659538](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1659538).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 2 November 2014
and made public on 14 May 2015.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.43

### 22 November 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.43

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.42 but the
release vote for the 6.0.42 release candidate did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 6.0.43 to obtain a version that
includes a fix for this issue, version 6.0.42 is not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Request Smuggling**
[CVE-2014-0227](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0227)

It was possible to craft a malformed chunk as part of a chunked request
that caused Tomcat to read part of the request body as a new request.

This was fixed in revision [1603628](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1603628).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 30 May 2014
and made public on 9 February 2015.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.41

### released 23 May 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.41

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.40 but the
release vote for the 6.0.40 release candidate did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 6.0.41 to obtain a version that
includes fixes for these issues, version 6.0.40 is not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0075](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0075)

It was possible to craft a malformed chunk size as part of a chucked
request that enabled an unlimited amount of data to be streamed to the
server, bypassing the various size limits enforced on a request. This
enabled a denial of service attack.

This was fixed in revision [1579262](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1579262).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat security team by David Jorm of the
Red Hat Security Response Team on 28 February 2014 and made public on 27
May 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.39

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0096)

The default servlet allows web applications to define (at multiple
levels) an XSLT to be used to format a directory listing. When running
under a security manager, the processing of these was not subject to the
same constraints as the web application. This enabled a malicious web
application to bypass the file access constraints imposed by the security
manager via the use of external XML entities.

This was fixed in revision [1585853](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1585853).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 February 2014
and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.39

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0099](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0099)

The code used to parse the request content length header did not check
for overflow in the result. This exposed a request smuggling
vulnerability when Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that
correctly processed the content length header.

This was fixed in revision [1580473](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1580473).

A test case that demonstrated the parsing bug was sent to the Tomcat
security team on 13 March 2014 but no context was provided. The security
implications were identified by the Tomcat security team the day the
report was received and made public on 27 May 2014.

**Low: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0119](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0119)

In limited circumstances it was possible for a malicious web application
to replace the XML parsers used by Tomcat to process XSLTs for the
default servlet, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs) and tag
plugin configuration files. The injected XML parser(s) could then bypass
the limits imposed on XML external entities and/or have visibility of the
XML files processed for other web applications deployed on the same
Tomcat instance.

This was fixed in revisions [1589640](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1589640),
[1593815](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1593815) and
[1593821](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1593821).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 April 2014
and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.39

### released 31 Jan 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.39

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.38 but the
release vote for 6.0.38 did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 6.0.39 to obtain a version
that includes the fixes for these issues, version 6.0.38 is not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Low: Frame injection in documentation Javadoc**
[CVE-2013-1571](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1571)

Tomcat 6 is built with Java 5 which is known to generate Javadoc with a
frame injection vulnerability.

The published Javadoc on the Apache Tomcat website was fixed the day
this issue was announced. The Javadoc generation for releases was fixed
in revision [1557724](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1557724).

This issue was published by Oracle on 18 June 2013.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.37

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2013-4286](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4286)

The fix for CVE-2005-2090 was not complete. It did not cover the
following cases:

* content-length header with chunked encoding over any HTTP connector
* multiple content-length headers over any AJP connector

Requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length
header when chunked encoding is being used should be rejected as invalid.
When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat) process
a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain either multiple
content-length headers or a content-length header when chunked encoding
is being used and several components do not reject the request and make
different decisions as to which content-length header to use an attacker
can poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and obtain sensitive
information from requests other then their own. Tomcat now rejects
requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length
header when chunked encoding is being used.

This was fixed in revision [1552565](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1552565).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team on 15 August
2013 and made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.37

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2013-4322](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4322)

The fix for CVE-2012-3544 was not complete. It did not cover the
following cases:

* chunk extensions were not limited
* whitespace after the : in a trailing header was not limited

This was fixed in revision [1556540](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1556540).

The first part of this issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security
team on 27 August 2013 and the second part by Saran Neti of TELUS
Security Labs on 5 November 2013. It was made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.37

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2013-4590](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4590)

Application provided XML files such as web.xml, context.xml, \*.tld,
\*.tagx and \*.jspx allowed XXE which could be used to expose Tomcat
internals to an attacker. This vulnerability only occurs when Tomcat is
running web applications from untrusted sources such as in a shared
hosting environment.

This was fixed in revision [1558828](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1558828).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team on 29
October 2013 and made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.37

**Low: Session fixation**
[CVE-2014-0033](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0033)

Previous fixes to path parameter handling
([1149220](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1149220)) introduced a regression that
meant session IDs provided in the URL were considered even when
disableURLRewriting was configured to true. Note that the session is only
used for that single request.

This was fixed in revision [1558822](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1558822).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team on 1
December 2013 and made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 6.0.33 to 6.0.37

### released 3 May 2013 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.37

**Important: Session fixation**
[CVE-2013-2067](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2067)

FORM authentication associates the most recent request requiring
authentication with the current session. By repeatedly sending a request
for an authenticated resource while the victim is completing the login
form, an attacker could inject a request that would be executed using
the victim's credentials.

Note that the option to change session ID on authentication was added in
Tomcat 6.0.21. In earlier 6.0.x releases, prevention of session fixation
was an application responsibility. This vulnerability represents a bug in
Tomcat's session fixation protection that was added in 6.0.21.
Hence, only versions 6.0.21 onwards are listed as vulnerable.

This was fixed in revision [1417891](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1417891).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 15 Oct 2012 and
made public on 10 May 2013.

Affects: 6.0.21-6.0.36

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-3544](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3544)

When processing a request submitted using the chunked transfer encoding,
Tomcat ignored but did not limit any extensions that were included. This
allows a client to perform a limited DOS by streaming an unlimited
amount of data to the server.

This was fixed in revision [1476592](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1476592).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat security team on 10 November 2011
and made public on 10 May 2013.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.36

### released 19 Oct 2012 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.36

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-2733](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2733)

The checks that limited the permitted size of request headers were
implemented too late in the request parsing process for the HTTP NIO
connector. This enabled a malicious user to trigger an
OutOfMemoryError by sending a single request with very large headers.

This was fixed in revision [1356208](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1356208).

This was reported by Josh Spiewak to the Tomcat security team on 4 June
2012 and made public on 5 November 2012.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.35

**Moderate: DIGEST authentication weakness**
[CVE-2012-3439](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3439)

Three weaknesses in Tomcat's implementation of DIGEST authentication
were identified and resolved:

1. Tomcat tracked client rather than server nonces and nonce count.
2. When a session ID was present, authentication was bypassed.
3. The user name and password were not checked before when indicating
   that a nonce was stale.

These issues reduced the security of DIGEST authentication making
replay attacks possible in some circumstances.

This was fixed in revision [1380829](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1380829).

The first issue was reported by Tilmann Kuhn to the Tomcat security team
on 19 July 2012. The second and third issues were discovered by the
Tomcat security team during the resulting code review. All three issues
were made public on 5 November 2012.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.35

**Important: Bypass of security constraints**
[CVE-2012-3546](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3546)

When using FORM authentication it was possible to bypass the security
constraint checks in the FORM authenticator by appending
`/j_security_check` to the end of the URL if some other
component (such as the Single-Sign-On valve) had called
`request.setUserPrincipal()` before the call to
`FormAuthenticator#authenticate()`.

This was fixed in revision [1381035](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1381035).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 13 July 2012 and
made public on 4 December 2012.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.35

**Important: Bypass of CSRF prevention filter**
[CVE-2012-4431](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4431)

The CSRF prevention filter could be bypassed if a request was made to a
protected resource without a session identifier present in the request.

This was fixed in revision [1394456](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1394456).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 8 September 2012
and made public on 4 December 2012.

Affects: 6.0.30-6.0.35

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-4534](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4534)

When using the NIO connector with sendfile and HTTPS enabled, if a client
breaks the connection while reading the response an infinite loop is
entered leading to a denial of service. This was originally reported as
[bug
52858](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52858).

This was fixed in revision [1372035](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1372035).

The security implications of this bug were reported to the Tomcat
security team by Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team on
3 October 2012 and made public on 4 December 2012.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.35

### released 5 Dec 2011 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.35

**Note:** *The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat
6.0.34 but the release vote for the 6.0.34 release candidate did not
pass. Therefore, although users must download 6.0.35 to obtain a version
that includes a fix for this issue, version 6.0.34 is not included in the
list of affected versions.*

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-3375](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3375)

For performance reasons, information parsed from a request is often
cached in two places: the internal request object and the internal
processor object. These objects are not recycled at exactly the same
time. When certain errors occur that needed to be added to the access
log, the access logging process triggers the re-population of the request
object after it has been recycled. However, the request object was not
recycled before being used for the next request. That lead to information
leakage (e.g. remote IP address, HTTP headers) from the previous request
to the next request. The issue was resolved be ensuring that the request
and response objects were recycled after being re-populated to generate
the necessary access log entries.

This was fixed in [revision 1185998](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1185998).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 22 September 2011 and
made public on 17 January 2012.

Affects: 6.0.30-6.0.33

**Important: Authentication bypass and information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-3190](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3190)

Apache Tomcat supports the AJP protocol which is used with reverse
proxies to pass requests and associated data about the request from the
reverse proxy to Tomcat. The AJP protocol is designed so that when a
request includes a request body, an unsolicited AJP message is sent to
Tomcat that includes the first part (or possibly all) of the request
body. In certain circumstances, Tomcat did not process this message as a
request body but as a new request. This permitted an attacker to have
full control over the AJP message permitting authentication bypass and
information disclosure. This vulnerability only occurs when all of the
following are true:

* The org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler AJP connector is not used
* POST requests are accepted
* The request body is not processed

This was fixed in [revision 1162959](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1162959).

This was reported publicly on 20th August 2011.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.33

Mitigation options:

* Upgrade to Tomcat 6.0.35.
* Apply the appropriate [patch](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1162959).
* Configure both Tomcat and the reverse proxy to use a shared secret.

  (It is "`request.secret`" attribute in AJP <Connector>,
  "`worker.workername.secret`" directive for mod\_jk.
  The mod\_proxy\_ajp module currently does not support shared secrets).
* Use the org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler (BIO) AJP connector
  implementation.

  (It is automatically selected if you do not have Tomcat-Native library
  installed. It can be also selected explicitly:
  `<Connector protocol="org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler">`).

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-0022](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0022)

Analysis of the recent hash collision vulnerability identified unrelated
inefficiencies with Apache Tomcat's handling of large numbers of
parameters and parameter values. These inefficiencies could allow an
attacker, via a specially crafted request, to cause large amounts of CPU
to be used which in turn could create a denial of service. The issue was
addressed by modifying the Tomcat parameter handling code to efficiently
process large numbers of parameters and parameter values.

This was fixed in revisions [1200601](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1200601),
[1206324](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1206324) and
[1229027](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1229027).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 21 October 2011 and
made public on 17 January 2012.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.33

### released 18 Aug 2011 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.33

**Moderate: Multiple weaknesses in HTTP DIGEST authentication**
[CVE-2011-1184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1184)

Note: Mitre elected to break this issue down into multiple issues and
have allocated the following additional references to parts of this
issue:
[CVE-2011-5062](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5062),
[CVE-2011-5063](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5063) and
[CVE-2011-5064](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5064). The Apache Tomcat security team will
continue to treat this as a single issue using the reference
[CVE-2011-1184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1184).

The implementation of HTTP DIGEST authentication was discovered to have
several weaknesses:

* replay attacks were permitted
* server nonces were not checked
* client nonce counts were not checked
* qop values were not checked
* realm values were not checked
* the server secret was hard-coded to a known string

The result of these weaknesses is that DIGEST authentication was only as
secure as BASIC authentication.

This was fixed in [revision 1158180](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1158180).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 16 March 2011 and
made public on 26 September 2011.

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2204](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2204)

When using the MemoryUserDatabase (based on tomcat-users.xml) and
creating users via JMX, an exception during the user creation process may
trigger an error message in the JMX client that includes the user's
password. This error message is also written to the Tomcat logs. User
passwords are visible to administrators with JMX access and/or
administrators with read access to the tomcat-users.xml file. Users that
do not have these permissions but are able to read log files may be able
to discover a user's password.

This was fixed in [revision 1140071](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1140071).

This was identified by Polina Genova on 14 June 2011 and
made public on 27 June 2011.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.32

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2526)

Tomcat provides support for sendfile with the HTTP NIO and HTTP APR
connectors. sendfile is used automatically for content served via the
DefaultServlet and deployed web applications may use it directly via
setting request attributes. These request attributes were not validated.
When running under a security manager, this lack of validation allowed a
malicious web application to do one or more of the following that would
normally be prevented by a security manager:

* return files to users that the security manager should make
  inaccessible
* terminate (via a crash) the JVM

Additionally, these vulnerabilities only occur when all of the following
are true:

* untrusted web applications are being used
* the SecurityManager is used to limit the untrusted web applications
* the HTTP NIO or HTTP APR connector is used
* sendfile is enabled for the connector (this is the default)

This was fixed in [revision 1146703](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1146703).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 7 July 2011 and
made public on 13 July 2011.

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2729](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2729)

Due to a bug in the capabilities code, jsvc (the service wrapper for
Linux that is part of the Commons Daemon project) does not drop
capabilities allowing the application to access files and directories
owned by superuser. This vulnerability only occurs when all of the
following are true:

* Tomcat is running on a Linux operating system
* jsvc was compiled with libcap
* -user parameter is used

Affected Tomcat versions shipped with source files for jsvc that included
this vulnerability.

This was fixed in [revision 1153824](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1153824).

This was identified by Wilfried Weissmann on 20 July 2011 and made public
on 12 August 2011.

Affects: 6.0.30-6.0.32

### released 03 Feb 2011 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.32

**Note:** *The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.31 but the
release vote for the 6.0.31 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 6.0.32 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for this issue, version 6.0.31 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service**
[CVE-2011-0534](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0534)

The NIO connector expands its buffer endlessly during request line
processing. That behaviour can be used for a denial of service attack
using a carefully crafted request.

This was fixed in [revision 1066313](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1066313).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 Jan 2011 and
made public on 5 Feb 2011.

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2011-0013](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0013)

The HTML Manager interface displayed web application provided data, such
as display names, without filtering. A malicious web application could
trigger script execution by an administrative user when viewing the
manager pages.

This was fixed in [revision 1057270](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1057270).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 Nov 2010 and
made public on 5 Feb 2011.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.29

**Moderate: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2010-4172](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4172)

The Manager application used the user provided parameters sort and
orderBy directly without filtering thereby permitting cross-site
scripting.

This was fixed in [revision 1037779](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1037779).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 15 Nov 2010 and
made public on 22 Nov 2010.

Affects: 6.0.12-6.0.29

**Low: SecurityManager file permission bypass**
[CVE-2010-3718](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3718)

When running under a SecurityManager, access to the file system is
limited but web applications are granted read/write permissions to the
work directory. This directory is used for a variety of temporary files
such as the intermediate files generated when compiling JSPs to Servlets.
The location of the work directory is specified by a ServletContect
attribute that is meant to be read-only to web applications. However,
due to a coding error, the read-only setting was not applied. Therefore,
a malicious web application may modify the attribute before Tomcat
applies the file permissions. This can be used to grant read/write
permissions to any area on the file system which a malicious web
application may then take advantage of. This vulnerability is only
applicable when hosting web applications from untrusted sources such as
shared hosting environments.

This was fixed in [revision 1022560](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1022560).

This was discovered by the Tomcat security team on 12 Oct 2010 and
made public on 5 Feb 2011.

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service and Information Disclosure
Vulnerability**
[CVE-2010-2227](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2227)

Several flaws in the handling of the 'Transfer-Encoding' header were
found that prevented the recycling of a buffer. A remote attacker could
trigger this flaw which would cause subsequent requests to fail and/or
information to leak between requests. This flaw is mitigated if Tomcat is
behind a reverse proxy (such as Apache httpd 2.2) as the proxy should
reject the invalid transfer encoding header.

This was fixed in [revision 958977](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=958977).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 14 Jun 2010 and
made public on 9 Jul 2010.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.27

**Note:** *The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.27 but the
release vote for the 6.0.27 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 6.0.28 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for this issue, version 6.0.27 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Low: Information disclosure in authentication headers**
[CVE-2010-1157](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1157)

The `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header for BASIC and DIGEST
authentication includes a realm name. If a
`<realm-name>` element is specified for the application
in web.xml it will be used. However, a `<realm-name>`
is not specified then Tomcat will generate realm name using the code
snippet `request.getServerName() + ":" +
request.getServerPort()`. In some circumstances this can expose
the local host name or IP address of the machine running Tomcat.

This was fixed in [revision 936540](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=936540).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 31 Dec 2009 and
made public on 21 Apr 2010.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.26

### released 21 Jan 2010 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.24

**Note:** *These issues were fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.21 but the
release votes for the 6.0.21, 6.0.22 and 6.0.23 release candidates did
not pass. Therefore, although users must download 6.0.24 to obtain a
version that includes fixes for these issues, versions 6.0.21 onwards
are not included in the list of affected versions.*

**Low: Arbitrary file deletion and/or alteration on deploy**
[CVE-2009-2693](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2693)

When deploying WAR files, the WAR files were not checked for directory
traversal attempts. This allows an attacker to create arbitrary content
outside of the web root by including entries such as
`../../bin/catalina.sh` in the WAR.

This was fixed in [revision 892815](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=892815).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 30 Jul 2009 and

**Low: Insecure partial deploy after failed undeploy**
[CVE-2009-2901](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2901)

By default, Tomcat automatically deploys any directories placed in a
host's appBase. This behaviour is controlled by the autoDeploy attribute
of a host which defaults to true. After a failed undeploy, the remaining
files will be deployed as a result of the autodeployment process.
Depending on circumstances, files normally protected by one or more
security constraints may be deployed without those security constraints,
making them accessible without authentication. This issue only affects
Windows platforms.

This was fixed in [revision 892815](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=892815).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 30 Jul 2009 and
made public on 1 Mar 2010.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.20 (Windows only)

**Low: Unexpected file deletion in work directory**
[CVE-2009-2902](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2902)

When deploying WAR files, the WAR file names were not checked for
directory traversal attempts. For example, deploying and undeploying
`...war` allows an attacker to cause the deletion of the
current contents of the host's work directory which may cause problems
for currently running applications.

This was fixed in [revision 892815](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=892815).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 30 Jul 2009 and
made public on 1 Mar 2010.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.20

**Low: Insecure default password**
[CVE-2009-3548](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3548)

The Windows installer defaults to a blank password for the administrative
user. If this is not changed during the install process, then by default
a user is created with the name admin, roles admin and manager and a
blank password.

This was fixed in [revision 881771](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=881771).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 26 Oct 2009 and
made public on 9 Nov 2009.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.20

### released 3 Jun 2009 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.20

**Note:** *These issues were fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.19 but the release
vote for that release candidate did not pass. Therefore, although users
must download 6.0.20 to obtain a version that includes fixes for these
issues, 6.0.19 is not included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2008-5515](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5515)

When using a RequestDispatcher obtained from the Request, the target path
was normalised before the query string was removed. A request that
included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to access
content that would otherwise be protected by a security constraint or by
locating it in under the WEB-INF directory.

This was fixed in [revision 734734](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=734734).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 11 Dec 2008 and
made public on 8 Jun 2009.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.18

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2009-0033](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0033)

If Tomcat receives a request with invalid headers via the Java AJP
connector, it does not return an error and instead closes the AJP
connection. In case this connector is member of a mod\_jk load balancing
worker, this member will be put into an error state and will be blocked
from use for approximately one minute. Thus the behaviour can be used for
a denial of service attack using a carefully crafted request.

This was fixed in [revision 742915](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=742915).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 26 Jan 2009 and
made public on 3 Jun 2009.

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2009-0580](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0580)

Due to insufficient error checking in some authentication classes, Tomcat
allows for the enumeration (brute force testing) of user names by
supplying illegally URL encoded passwords. The attack is possible if FORM
based authentication (j\_security\_check) is used with the MemoryRealm.

This was fixed in [revision 747840](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=747840).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 25 Feb 2009 and
made public on 3 Jun 2009.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.18

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2009-0781](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0781)

The calendar application in the examples web application contains an
XSS flaw due to invalid HTML which renders the XSS filtering protection
ineffective.

This was fixed in [revision 750924](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=750924).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 5 Mar 2009 and

to replace the XML parser used by
Tomcat to process web.xml, context.xml and tld files. In limited
circumstances these bugs may allow a rogue web application to view and/or
alter the web.xml, context.xml and tld files of other web applications
deployed on the Tomcat instance.

This was fixed in revisions [652592](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=652592) and
[739522](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=739522).

### released 31 Jul 2008 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.18

**Note:** *These issues were fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.17 but the release
vote for that release candidate did not pass. Therefore, although users
must download 6.0.18 to obtain a version that includes fixes for these
issues, 6.0.17 is not included in the list of affected versions.*

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2008-1232](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1232)

The message argument of HttpServletResponse.sendError() call is not only
displayed on the error page, but is also used for the reason-phrase of
HTTP response. This may include characters that are illegal in HTTP
headers. It is possible for a specially crafted message to result in
arbitrary content being injected into the HTTP response. For a successful
XSS attack, unfiltered user supplied data must be included in the message
argument.

This was fixed in [revision 673834](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=673834).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 24 Jan 2008 and
made public on 1 Aug 2008.

[CVE-2008-1947](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1947)

The Host Manager web application did not escape user provided data before
including it in the output. This enabled a XSS attack. This application
now filters the data before use. This issue may be mitigated by logging
out (closing the browser) of the application once the management tasks
have been completed.

This was fixed in [revision 662585](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=662585).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 15 May 2008 and

The JULI logging component allows web applications to provide their own
logging configurations. The default security policy does not restrict
this configuration and allows an untrusted web application to add files
or overwrite existing files where the Tomcat process has the necessary
file permissions to do so.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.15

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2007-5461](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5461)

When Tomcat's WebDAV servlet is configured for use with a context and
has been enabled for write, some WebDAV requests that specify an entity

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2007-2449](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2449)

JSPs within the examples web application did not escape user provided
data before including it in the output. This enabled a XSS attack. These
JSPs now filter the data before use. This issue may be mitigated by
undeploying the examples web application. Note that it is recommended
that the examples web application is not installed on a production
system.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.13

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2007-2450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2450)

The Manager and Host Manager web applications did not escape user

**Low: Session hi-jacking**
[CVE-2007-3382](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3382)

Tomcat incorrectly treated a single quote character (') in a cookie
value as a delimiter. In some circumstances this lead to the leaking of
information such as session ID to an attacker.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.13

**Low: Session hi-jacking**
[CVE-2007-3385](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3385)

**Moderate: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2007-1355](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1355)

The JSP and Servlet included in the sample application within the Tomcat
documentation webapp did not escape user provided data before including
it in the output. This enabled a XSS attack. These pages have been
simplified not to use any user provided data in the output.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.10

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2005-2090](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2090)

Requests with multiple content-length headers should be rejected as
invalid. When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat)
process a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain
multiple content-length headers and several components do not
reject the request and make different decisions as to which
content-length header to use an attacker can poison a web-cache, perform
an XSS attack and obtain sensitive information from requests other then
their own. Tomcat now returns 400 for requests with multiple
content-length headers.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.10

### released 28 Feb 2007 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.10

**Important: Directory traversal**
[CVE-2007-0450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450)

Tomcat permits '\', '%2F' and '%5C' as path delimiters. When Tomcat is used
behind a proxy (including, but not limited to, Apache HTTP server with
mod\_proxy and mod\_jk) configured to only proxy some contexts, a HTTP request
containing strings like "/\../" may allow attackers to work around the context
restriction of the proxy, and access the non-proxied contexts.

The following Java system properties have been added to Tomcat to provide
additional control of the handling of path delimiters in URLs (both options
default to false):

* `org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH`: `true|false`
* `org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.ALLOW_BACKSLASH`: `true|false`

Due to the impossibility to guarantee that all URLs are handled by Tomcat as
they are in proxy servers, Tomcat should always be secured as if no proxy
restricting context access was used.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.9

### released 8 Feb 2007 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.9

**Moderate: Session hi-jacking**
[CVE-2008-0128](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0128)

When using the SingleSignOn Valve via https the Cookie JSESSIONIDSSO is
transmitted without the "secure" attribute, resulting in it being
transmitted to any content that is - by purpose or error - requested via
http from the same server.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.8

### released 18 Dec 2006 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.6

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2007-1358](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1358)

Web pages that display the Accept-Language header value sent by the
client are susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack if they assume
the Accept-Language header value conforms to RFC 2616. Under normal
circumstances this would not be possible to exploit, however older
versions of Flash player were known to allow carefully crafted malicious
Flash files to make requests with such custom headers. When generating
the response for `getLocale()` and `getLocales()`,
Tomcat now ignores values for Accept-Language headers that do not conform
to RFC 2616. Applications that use the raw header values directly should
not assume that the headers conform to RFC 2616 and should filter the
values appropriately.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.5

### Not a vulnerability in Tomcat

**Low: Denial Of Service**
[CVE-2012-5568](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5568)

Sending an HTTP request 1 byte at a time will consume a thread from the
connection pool until the request has been fully processed if using the
BIO or APR/native HTTP connectors. Multiple requests may be used to
consume all threads in the connection pool thereby creating a denial of
service.

Since the relationship between the client side resources and server side
resources is a linear one, this issue is not something that the Tomcat
Security Team views as a vulnerability. This is a generic DoS problem and
there is no magic solution. This issue has been discussed several times
on the Tomcat mailing lists. The best place to start to review these
discussions is the report for
[bug
54236](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54263).

This was first discussed on the public Tomcat users mailing list on 19
June 2009.

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service**
[CVE-2010-4476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4476)

A JVM bug could cause Double conversion to hang JVM when accessing to a
form based security constrained page or any page that calls
javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getLocale() or
javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getLocales(). A specially crafted request
can be used to trigger a denial of service.

A work-around for this JVM bug was provided in
[revision 1066315](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1066315).
This work-around is included in Tomcat 6.0.32 onwards.

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 01 Feb 2011 and
made public on 31 Jan 2011.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.31

**Moderate: TLS SSL Man In The Middle**
[CVE-2009-3555](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555)

A vulnerability exists in the TLS protocol that allows an attacker to
inject arbitrary requests into an TLS stream during renegotiation.

The TLS implementation used by Tomcat varies with connector. The blocking
IO (BIO) and non-blocking (NIO) connectors use the JSSE implementation
provided by the JVM. The APR/native connector uses OpenSSL.

The BIO connector is vulnerable if the JSSE version used is vulnerable.
To workaround this until a fix is available in JSSE, a new connector
attribute `allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation` has been added to
the BIO connector. It should be set to `false` (the default)
to protect against this vulnerability.

The NIO connector is not vulnerable as it does not support
renegotiation.

The APR/native workarounds are detailed on the
[APR/native connector security page](security-native.html).

Users should be aware that the impact of disabling renegotiation will
vary with both application and client. In some circumstances disabling
renegotiation may result in some clients being unable to access the
application.

A workaround was implemented in
[revision 881774](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=881774) and
[revision 891292](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=891292)
that provided the new `allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation`
attribute. This work around is included in Tomcat 6.0.21 onwards.

Support for the new TLS renegotiation protocol (RFC 5746) that does not
have this security issue:

* For connectors using JSSE implementation provided by JVM:
  Added in Tomcat 6.0.32.

  Requires JRE that supports RFC 5746. For Oracle JRE that is
  [known](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/tlsreadme2-176330.html)
  to be 6u22 or later.
* For connectors using APR and OpenSSL:

  TBD. See
  [APR/native connector security page](security-native.html).

**Important: Directory traversal**
[CVE-2008-2938](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2938)

Originally reported as a Tomcat vulnerability the root cause of this
issue is that the JVM does not correctly decode UTF-8 encoded URLs to
UTF-8. This exposes a directory traversal vulnerability when the
connector uses `URIEncoding="UTF-8"`. This directory traversal
is limited to the docBase of the web application.

If a context is configured with `allowLinking="true"` then the
directory traversal vulnerability is extended to the entire file system
of the host server.

It should also be noted that setting
`useBodyEncodingForURI="true"` has the same effect as setting
`URIEncoding="UTF-8"` when processing requests with bodies
encoded with UTF-8.

Although the root cause was quickly identified as a JVM issue and that it
affected multiple JVMs from multiple vendors, it was decided to report
this as a Tomcat vulnerability until such time as the JVM vendors
provided updates to resolve this issue. For further information on the
status of this issue for your JVM, contact your JVM vendor.

A workaround was implemented in
[revision 678137](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=678137)
that protects against this and any similar character
encoding issues that may still exist in the JVM. This work around is
included in Tomcat 6.0.18 onwards.

**Important: Remote Memory Read**
[CVE-2014-0160](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160) (a.k.a. "Heartbleed")

A bug in certain versions of [OpenSSL](www.openssl.org)
can allow an unauthenticated remote user to read certain contents of
the server's memory. Binary versions of tcnative 1.1.24 - 1.1.29
include this vulnerable version of OpenSSL. tcnative 1.1.30 and later
ship with patched versions of OpenSSL.

This issue was first announced on 7 April 2014.

Affects: OpenSSL 1.0.1-1.0.1f, tcnative 1.1.24-1.1.29

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 253 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Affected Products and Versions column. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.

For an overview of the Oracle product documentation related to this Critical Patch Update, please refer to the Oracle Critical Patch Update October 2016 Documentation Map, [My Oracle Support Note](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2162757.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](http://java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use automatic updates to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users can download the latest release of Netbeans from [http://netbeans.org](http://netbeans.org/). Users running earlier versions of Netbeans can use automatic updates to get the latest patches.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2171485.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2171485.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=12955#c0)  David Walser    2014-03-06 20:42:57 CET  ``` Three security issues previously fixed upstream in tomcat were made public on February 25: <http://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html>  Ubuntu has issued an advisory including the first two today: <http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2130-1/>  Since CVE-2013-4286 was fixed in 7.0.47, Mageia 4 and Cauldron are not affected.  CVE-2013-4322 and CVE-2013-4590 were fixed in 7.0.50, so Mageia 3, Mageia 4, and Cauldron are all affected.  Reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: ```  David Walser    2014-03-06 20:43:05 CET   Whiteboard: (none) => MGA4TOO, MGA3TOO  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=12955#c1)  David Walser    2014-03-30 17:05:36 CEST  ``` Updated packages uploaded for Mageia 3, Mageia 4, and Cauldron.  The changes in the Mageia 3 package are fairly significant, since I synced it with Cauldron.  I did verify that all of the subpackages install cleanly, the tomcat service starts, and connecting to it on port 8080 does produce a web page.  Advisory (Mageia 3): ========================  Updated tomcat packages fix security vulnerabilities:  Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.47, when an HTTP connector or AJP connector is used, does not properly handle certain inconsistent HTTP request headers, which allows remote attackers to trigger incorrect identification of a request's length and conduct request-smuggling attacks via (1) multiple Content-Length headers or (2) a Content-Length header and a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header (CVE-2013-4286).  Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.50 processes chunked transfer coding without properly handling (1) a large total amount of chunked data or (2) whitespace characters in an HTTP header value within a trailer field, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by streaming data (CVE-2013-4322).  Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.50 allows attackers to obtain "Tomcat internals" information by leveraging the presence of an untrusted web application with a context.xml, web.xml, *.jspx, *.tagx, or *.tld XML document containing an external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue (CVE-2013-4590).

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Security Bulletin: Rational Test Control Panel in Rational Test Workbench and Rational Test Virtualization Server affected by Apache Tomcat vulnerablity (CVE-2013-4286, CVE-2013-4322, CVE-2013-4590)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Apache Tomcat is vulnerable affecting the Rational Test Control Panel in IBM Rational Test Workbench and Rational Test Virtualization Server.

## Vulnerability Details

|  | **Subscribe to My Notifications to be notified of important product support alerts like this.**  * Follow [this link](https://www.ibm.com/systems/support/myview/subscription/css.wss/subscriptions?methodName=startSearchToSubscribe&uctug_rational_dcfsbblurb_2013-11-05_myn_adoption_promo) for more information (requires login with your IBM ID) |
| --- | --- |

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2013-4286](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4286)

## Affected Products and Versions

Rational Test Control Panel component in Rational Test Virtualization Server and rational Test Workbench versions:

* All 8.0.x
* All 8.5.0.x

Versions 8.5.1 and later are unaffected as they do not use Apache Tomcat.

## Remediation/Fixes

The fixes for the CVEs mentioned above have been incorporated into the 7.0.52 release of Apache Tomcat. You should upgrade your installation by following the instructions below.

1. On the IBM Fix Central website, locate either the Rational Test Workbench or Rational Test Virtualization Server products. The Tomcat fix is titled '7.0.52-Rational-RTW-Tomcat-zip' or '7.0.52-Rational-RTVS-Tomcat-zip' depending on which product you selected.
2. Unzip the downloaded file to a directory.
3. Stop the server.
4. In the existing RTCP installation, save the files logging.properties and server.xml to a separate location. The default installation locations for these files are:

* Windows: C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalTestControlPanel\conf\
* AIX, Linux, Solaris: /opt/IBM/RationalTestControlPanel/conf/

6. Copy the contents of the unzipped Tomcat directory (except for the LICENSE file) into the RationalTestControlPanel directory, overwriting the existing files.
7. Copy the two configuration files you saved earlier back into /conf.
8. Start the server.

**Notes:**

* When updating an installation to a later version of Rational Test Control Panel, the security fix detailed above will have to be re-applied after the RTCP update
* When removing an installation that has had the security fix applied, not all the files will be removed by IBM Installation Manager, and some files will have to be removed manually.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1069911#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-25 22:15:41 UTC  ``` Application provided XML files such as web.xml, context.xml, *.tld, *.tagx and *.jspx allowed XXE which could be used to expose Tomcat internals to an attacker. This vulnerability only occurs when Tomcat is running web applications from untrusted sources such as in a shared hosting environment.  This has been corrected in upstream versions 8.0.0-rc10 [1], 7.0.50 [2], and 6.0.39 [3]  [1] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1549528> [2] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1549529> [3] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1558828>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1069911#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-25 23:05:01 UTC  ```  Created tomcat tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1069925](show_bug.cgi?id=1069925 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4322 CVE-2013-4590 CVE-2013-4286 tomcat: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1069911#c7)  David Jorm    2014-03-11 06:06:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect JBoss Web, as shipped with various Red Hat JBoss products.  This issue does affect Tomcat 5 as shipped by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. The risks in breaking compatibility associated with fixing this flaw outweigh the benefits of the fix, therefore Red Hat does not plan to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Additionally, note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is currently in reduced support phase, receiving only Critical security updates.  For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/site/support/policy/updates/errata#Production_3_Phase>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1069911#c29)  Martin Prpič    2014-08-06 11:43:37 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was found that several application-provided XML files, such as web.xml, content.xml, *.tld, *.tagx, and *.jspx, resolved external entities, permitting XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. An attacker able to deploy malicious applications to Tomcat could use this flaw to circumvent security restrictions set by the JSM, and gain access to sensitive information on the system. Note that this flaw only affected deployments in which Tomcat is running applications from untrusted sources, such as in a shared hosting environment.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1069911#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-08-11 16:46:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:1038 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1038.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1069911#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-08-21 15:30:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 2 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2014:1088 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1088.html>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1069911#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-08-21 15:31:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 2 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2014:1087 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1087.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1069911#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-08-21 15:32:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Web Server 2.1.0  Via RHSA-2014:1086 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1086.html>   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1069911#c34)  Fedora Update System    2014-09-26 09:02:30 UTC  ``` tomcat-7.0.52-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle has received specific reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply these Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

Oracle acknowledges Dana Taylor of netinfiltration.com for bringing to Oracle's attention a number of sites that were vulnerable to disclosure of sensitive information because Oracle CPU fixes were not applied to those sites for more than a year.

This Critical Patch Update contains 154 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on September 26, 2014, Oracle released a [Security Alert for CVE-2014-7169 "Bash"](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2014-7169.html) and other publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting GNU Bash. Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in the Security Alert for CVE-2014-7169.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2014verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1912224.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1912224.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 22 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in the Tomcat servlet
and JSP engine, which may result on bypass of security manager
restrictions, information disclosure, denial of service or session
fixation.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0.45+dfsg-1~deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat6 packages.
