- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple user-facing functions in StatusNet do not sanitize API input before using it in database query strings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exfiltration of database data and, potentially, file I/O to the database server's disk if the MySQL server is misconfigured.
- **Attack vectors**:  Through user-facing functions that do not sanitize API input used in database queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the user-facing functions of the StatusNet application.
