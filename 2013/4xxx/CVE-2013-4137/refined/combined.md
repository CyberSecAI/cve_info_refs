# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on

Subject: CVE-2013-4137: StatusNet v1.1.0: SQL injection

This is an advisory for StatusNet v1.0.0 through v1.1.0.

Multiple user-facing functions do not sanitize API input before interpolating it into database query strings.  This can result of exfiltration of database data, and depending on MySQL server (mis)configuration, can also result in file I/O to the database server disk.

StatusNet versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 have been released to correct these issues.  Patching to these versions as soon as possible is advised.  For more information, visit:
  <http://status.net/2013/07/16/security-alert-sql-injection-attack-for-statusnet-1-0-x-and-1-1-x>

Advisory title: Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities
Product: StatusNet
Discovered by:
  Elly Fong-Jones
  Joshua Wise (NVIDIA Corporation)
Known vulnerable versions: 1.0.0 - 1.1.0
Tested: 1.1.0, 2013-07-16
Fixed in version: 1.1.1
Vulnerability type: CWE-89 (SQL Injection)
CVE IDs: CVE-2013-4137

My thanks to the Evan Prodromou for his help in quickly responding to these issues and releasing a new version.
