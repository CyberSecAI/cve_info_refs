# [CVE request] Django 1.4.6 security release

Hi,
this needs two CVE assignments:

Issue: Cross-site scripting (XSS) in admin interface

The Django administrative application, django.contrib.admin, provides functionality for CRUD (Creation, Retrieval,
Updating and Deleting) operations by trusted users, including facilities for both automatic and customized
data-manipulation interfaces.

When displaying the value of a URLField -- a model field type for storing URLs -- this interface treated the values of
such fields as safe, thus failing to properly accommodate the potential for dangerous values. A proof-of-concept
application has been provided to the Django project, showing how this can be exploited to perform XSS in the
administrative interface.

In a normal Django deployment, this will only affect the administrative interface, as the incorrect handling occurs
only in form-widget code in django.contrib.admin. It is, however, possible that other applications may be affected, if
those applications make use of form widgets provided by the admin interface.

To remedy this issue, the widget in question -- django.contrib.admin.widgets.AdminURLFieldWidget -- has been corrected
to treat its value the same as any other potentially-user-supplied value; in other words, it will be treated as unsafe,
and subject to Django's (enabled by default) output escaping.

Thanks to Łukasz Langa for reporting this issue to us.

Issue: Possible XSS via is_safe_url

A common pattern in Django applications is for a view to accept, via querystring parameter, a URL to redirect to upon
successful completion of the view's processing. This pattern is used in code bundled with Django itself; for example,
the login view in django.contrib.auth.views, which accepts such a parameter to determine where to send a user following
successful login.

A utility function -- django.utils.http.is_safe_url() -- is provided and used to validate that this URL is on the
current host (either via fully-qualified or relative URL), so as to avoid potentially dangerous redirects from
maliciously-constructed querystrings.

The is_safe_url() function works as intended for HTTP and HTTPS URLs, but due to the manner in which it parses the URL,
will permit redirects to other schemes, such as javascript:. While the Django project is unaware of any demonstrated
ability to perform cross-site scripting attacks via this mechanism, the potential for such is sufficient to trigger a
security response.

To remedy this issue, the is_safe_url() function has been modified to properly recognize and reject URLs which specify
a scheme other than HTTP or HTTPS.

Thanks to Nick Bruun for reporting this issue to us.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Security releases issued

Posted by **Jacob Kaplan-Moss** on Aug. 13, 2013

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.4.6,
Django 1.5.2, and Django 1.6 beta 2 -- as part of our security process.
These releases are now available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django)
and our [download page](/download/)

These releases address two cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities: one in a
widget used by Django's admin interface, and one in a utility function used to
validate redirects often used after login or logout.

While these issues present limited risk and may not affect all Django users,
we encourage all users to evaluate their own risk and upgrade when possible.

For more details, read on.

#### Issue: Cross-site scripting (XSS) in admin interface

The Django administrative application, django.contrib.admin,
provides functionality for CRUD (Creation, Retrieval, Updating and
Deleting) operations by trusted users, including facilities for both
automatic and customized data-manipulation interfaces.

When displaying the value of a URLField -- a model field type for
storing URLs -- this interface treated the values of such fields as
safe, thus failing to properly accommodate the potential for dangerous
values. A proof-of-concept application has been provided to the Django
project, showing how this can be exploited to perform XSS in the
administrative interface.

In a normal Django deployment, this will only affect the
administrative interface, as the incorrect handling occurs only in
form-widget code in django.contrib.admin. It is, however, possible
that other applications may be affected, if those applications make
use of form widgets provided by the admin interface.

To remedy this issue, the widget in question --
django.contrib.admin.widgets.AdminURLFieldWidget -- has been
corrected to treat its value the same as any other
potentially-user-supplied value; in other words, it will be treated as
unsafe, and subject to Django's (enabled by default) output escaping.

Thanks to Łukasz Langa for reporting this issue to us.

#### Issue: Possible XSS via is\_safe\_url

A common pattern in Django applications is for a view to accept, via
querystring parameter, a URL to redirect to upon successful completion
of the view's processing. This pattern is used in code bundled with
Django itself; for example, the login view in
django.contrib.auth.views, which accepts such a parameter to
determine where to send a user following successful login.

A utility function -- django.utils.http.is\_safe\_url() -- is
provided and used to validate that this URL is on the current host
(either via fully-qualified or relative URL), so as to avoid
potentially dangerous redirects from maliciously-constructed
querystrings.

The is\_safe\_url() function works as intended for HTTP and HTTPS
URLs, but due to the manner in which it parses the URL, will permit
redirects to other schemes, such as javascript:. While the Django
project is unaware of any demonstrated ability to perform cross-site
scripting attacks via this mechanism, the potential for such is
sufficient to trigger a security response.

To remedy this issue, the is\_safe\_url() function has been modified
to properly recognize and reject URLs which specify a scheme other
than HTTP or HTTPS.

Thanks to Nick Bruun for reporting this issue to us.

#### Affected versions

The URLField XSS issue affects the following versions of Django:

* Django 1.5
* Django 1.6 (currently at beta status)
* Django master development branch

The is\_safe\_url() issue affects the following versions of Django:

#### General notes regarding security reporting

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via private email
to *security@djangoproject.com*, and not via Django's Trac instance or the django-
developers list. Please see [our security policies](https://djangoproject.com/security)
for further information.

```

Ahh this should be:

For the Issue: Cross-site scripting (XSS) in admin interface please
