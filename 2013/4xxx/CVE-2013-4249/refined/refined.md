Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4249:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `AdminURLFieldWidget` in Django's admin interface was not properly escaping user-provided URLs when rendering them, which resulted in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The widget was treating the values of URLField as safe.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The `AdminURLFieldWidget` was vulnerable to XSS because it did not sanitize or escape URL values before displaying them in HTML. This means that a malicious URL could include JavaScript code that would be executed in the browser of a user viewing the admin interface, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL field, which would then be executed in the browser of a user viewing the admin interface.
- This could allow the attacker to:
    -  Hijack user sessions
    -  Steal sensitive data
    -  Perform actions on behalf of the user
    -  Deface the admin interface

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `URLField` in Django's admin interface. An attacker would need to insert a malicious URL into a field using this widget.
- This could potentially be done by a malicious user with access to create/edit entries that use a `URLField` or by exploiting other vulnerabilities which allow to control such fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to insert a malicious URL in the `URLField`
- This could potentially be an admin or a lower privileged user of the admin interface, or by exploiting another vulnerability to manipulate this data
- No specific network position is required as the attack is performed within the browser of a user accessing the administrative interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects the Django administrative interface, specifically the `AdminURLFieldWidget`, which is used for displaying URL fields.
- The fix involves ensuring that the `AdminURLFieldWidget` treats URL values as potentially unsafe and applies Django's built-in output escaping mechanisms.
- The vulnerability is present in Django versions 1.5, 1.6 and the master branch, but it also possible other applications might be affected if they use form widgets from the admin interface.
