| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=998223#c0)  Michael S.    2013-08-18 11:40:22 UTC  ``` by default, ansible try to create a ControlMaster file in a predictible location in /tmp. This is vulnerable to a ssh socket injection attack like this :  ~ $ sudo ln -s /tmp/ansible-ssh-elspeth.example.org-22-misc /tmp/ansible-ssh-sisay.example.org-22-misc   ~ $ ansible -i 'elspeth.example.org,sisay.example.org' all -m shell -u misc -a hostname elspeth.example.org | success | rc=0 >> elspeth.example.org  sisay.example.org | success | rc=0 >> elspeth.example.org  I also did a test without using root, that's the same. Based on this attack, someone could divert the ssh connexion to another server, make it connect to a server under the control of attacker, and steal configuration file ( with passwords ), or steal password with a fake sudo ( since ansible can also use sudo )  Please note that you need to : - disable selinux # setenforce 0  - disable latest protection from the kernel   # sysctl -w fs.protected_symlinks=0 # sysctl -w fs.protected_hardlinks=0  to make sure this work. I didn't found how/where ssh control the socket file for suitability, maybe it should   I am not sure what could be a good fix. I do have a patch that put the socket in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR but it is a very weak mitigation technique that do not work on older platform such as RHEL 6.   Another solution would be to make sure the socket is created in specific temporary directory, but this could make the software much slower.  And checking if the socket exist first is prone to race condition.  Upstream was not contacted yet, and plan to release 1.3 around 2 weeks. Issue is not public ( but quite easy to spot )   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=998223#c1)  Michael S.    2013-08-18 11:45:04 UTC  ``` The issue is in <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/runner/connection_plugins/ssh.py#L59>  Possible fix :  commit d06eaae5fa32ae24e8076f846bdf3f04e6090384 Author: Michael Scherer <misc> Date:   Sun Aug 18 13:19:01 2013 +0200      Try to mitigate symlink attacks on newer platform          A attacker could pre create a socket in /tmp and so divert     the ssh connexion to another server. However, newer platform     are protected against this since kernel 3.10 and surely with     a proper selinux policy.  diff --git a/lib/ansible/runner/connection_plugins/ssh.py b/lib/ansible/runner/connection_plugins/ssh.py index abbffcf..be8289e 100644 --- a/lib/ansible/runner/connection_plugins/ssh.py +++ b/lib/ansible/runner/connection_plugins/ssh.py @@ -51,12 +51,15 @@ class Connection(object):            self.common_args = []          extra_args = C.ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS +        control_path_dir = '/tmp' +        if 'XDG_RUNTIME_DIR' in os.environ: +            control_path_dir = os.environ['XDG_RUNTIME_DIR']          if extra_args is not None:              self.common_args += shlex.split(extra_args)          else:              self.common_args += ["-o", "ControlMaster=auto",                                   "-o", "ControlPersist=60s", -                                 "-o", "ControlPath=/tmp/ansible-ssh-%h-%p-%r"] +                                 "-o", "ControlPath=%s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r" % control_path_dir]            if not C.HOST_KEY_CHECKING:              self.common_args += ["-o", "StrictHostKeyChecking=no"]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=998223#c2)  Michael S.    2013-08-18 14:24:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 787788](attachment.cgi?id=787788&action=diff "better patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=787788&action=edit "better patch") better patch  So here is a proper patch, using a temporary directory shared during the playbook run.   However, it could be written more cleanly without using global, and using proper object lifecycle, but I consider that being minor when compared to the security fix.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=998223#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-19 20:12:46 UTC  ``` Hi, Michael.  The best thing to do here would be to alert upstream to this.  We can assign a CVE for this that you can pass along as well, and then we can open this bug up and get fixes into Fedora and EPEL6 once the issue is fixed upstream.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=998223#c4)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-19 20:28:31 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Michael Scherer for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=998223#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-19 20:29:09 UTC  ``` Michael, when you report this to upstream can you also note that it was assigned CVE-2013-4259?
