Hello CodeIgniter developers,

I noticed a few known security vulnerabilities (CVE-numbers) that apply to the CodeIgniter project (official CPE name cpe:/a:codeigniter:codeigniter).

For **cpe:/a:codeigniter:codeigniter:1.5.3** are four registered CVE reports:

* [CVE-2007-3709](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2m5c-p827-r3fx "CVE-2007-3709")
* [CVE-2007-3708](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wjrx-825m-6vc9 "CVE-2007-3708")
* [CVE-2007-3707](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ggmq-gfc4-hg63 "CVE-2007-3707")
* [CVE-2007-3706](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67wv-8wxx-3xhx "CVE-2007-3706")

For **cpe:/a:codeigniter:codeigniter:1.7.2** is just one known security report:

* [CVE-2011-3719](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rr2p-jqg3-9qg2 "CVE-2011-3719").

**Source:**

<http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-6918/product_id-11625/Codeigniter-Codeigniter.html>

I read some CVE related posts and I noticed that the value of a CVE database is not always appreciated or understood. Source:

* [Multiple vulnerabilities in session management.  #1702](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/1702)
* [Multiple cryptographic issues in Encrypt.php #3174](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3174)

Nevertheless I'm wondering why there are not more CVE's reported so far. I've been pretty active in following the CodeIgniter development and noticed last years that some security bugs have been fixed but are never reported to the CVE database.

I'm happy that CodeIgniter is an open-source project and like to contribute to that. Especially using my IT security expertise. For that reason I'd like to work out some CVE reports about different security bugs in previous versions that are currently fixed. This way there will be a clear and open view about the amount of security vulnerabilities per version and hopefully this will encourage the developers who didn't upgrade, to upgrade to the latest version of CodeIgniter.

For people who are unfamiliar to this world. In comparison and as an example this are the CVE lists of some other PHP frameworks and WordPress.

**Yii:**

<http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13516/product_id-28088/Yiiframework-Yiiframework.html>

**Zend:**

**Symfony:**

**WordPress:**

<http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2337/product_id-4096/Wordpress-Wordpress.html>

I'd like to hear some thoughts about this and especially I'm wondering if I should just work out some PoC's and just submit the bugs to the CVE database, or to discuss those bugs here before submitting them, just to make sure. Any thoughts?

*Also I'm working on a small concept for the same purpose. To try to detect the used CodeIgniter version on a website or application. <https://github.com/Calico90/codeigniter-version-scanner>*

Greetings!

## [CodeIgniter <= 2.1.3 xss\_clean() Filter Bypass](https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/07/codeigniter-21-xss-clean-filter-bypass/ "Permalink to CodeIgniter <= 2.1.3 xss_clean() FilterÂ Bypass")

Category: [Vulnerability Writeups](https://nealpoole.com/blog/category/vulnerability-writeups/) /
Tag: [security](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/security/), [web application security](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/web-application-security/), [php](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/php/), [xss](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/xss/), [codeigniter](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/codeigniter/) / [Add Comment](#respond)

### Summary

The [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) framework contains a function, `xss_clean()`, which is intended to filter out
potential XSS attacks. From [the CodeIgniter documentation](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/libraries/security.html):

> The XSS filter looks for commonly used techniques to trigger Javascript
> or other types of code that attempt to hijack cookies or do other malicious things.
> If anything disallowed is encountered it is rendered safe by converting the data
> to character entities.

I identified a form of malicious input that would bypass the `xss_clean()` filtering, allowing
for arbitrary JavaScript to be executed. The vulnerability has been patched in CodeIgniter 2.1.4.
Any developers relying on `xss_clean()` as a form of protection should upgrade
their application to the latest version of the framework.

This vulnerability has been designated CVE-2013-4891.

### Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability is straightforward to understand. The `xss_clean()` function would only strip attributes
from HTML tags that were properly closed. However, browsers which see unclosed tags can choose to
parse them as though they were properly formed.

In this case, my proof of concept was:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` <img src="a" onerror='eval(atob("cHJvbXB0KDEpOw=="))'  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The lack of a `>` at the end meant that the onerror attribute wasn’t stripped by `xss_clean()`.
However, browsers would parse this input as a valid `img` tag with `src` and `onerror` attributes.
By using `eval` and `atob`, I was able to get arbitrary JavaScript to execute without having to worry
about any additional filtering.

### Note

The `xss_clean()` function employs multiple blacklists and as such is not a safe solution
for preventing XSS. Researchers have discovered bypasses for the filtering in the past
[[1]](http://blog.kotowicz.net/2012/07/codeigniter-210-xssclean-cross-site.html), [[2]](https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/issues/1705), [[3]](http://secureappdev.blogspot.com/2011/11/ellislab-xssclean-filter-bypass.html) and there is no guarantee that
more bypasses won’t be discovered in the future.

# Change Log

## Version 2.2.6

Release Date: October 31, 2015

* **Security**
  + Fixed an XSS attack vector in [Security Library](libraries/security.html) method `xss_clean()`.
  + Changed [Config Library](libraries/config.html) method `base_url()` to fallback to ``$\_SERVER['SERVER\_ADDR']`` in order to avoid Host header injections.
  + Changed [CAPTCHA Helper](helpers/captcha_helper.html) to try to use the operating system's PRNG first.

## Version 2.2.5

Release Date: October 8, 2015

* **Security**
  + Fixed a number of XSS attack vectors in [Security Library](libraries/security.html) method `xss_clean()` (thanks to Frans Rosén from [Detectify](https://detectify.com/)).

## Version 2.2.4

Release Date: August 20, 2015

* **Security**
  + Fixed an SQL injection vulnerability in [Active Record](database/active_record.html) method `offset()`.

## Version 2.2.3

Release Date: July 14, 2015

* **Security**
  + Removed a fallback to `mysql_escape_string()` in the 'mysql' database driver (`escape_str()` method) when there's no active database connection.

## Version 2.2.2

Release Date: April 15, 2015

* **Security**
  + Added HTTP "Host" header character validation to prevent cache poisoning attacks when `base_url` auto-detection is used.
  + Added `FSCommand` and `seekSegmentTime` to the "evil attributes" list in `CI_Security::xss_clean()`.

### Bug fixes:

* Fixed a bug (#3665) - `CI_Security::entity_decode()` triggered warnings under some circumstances.

## Version 2.2.1

Release Date: January 22, 2015

* General Changes
  + Improved security in `xss_clean()`.
  + Updated timezones in [Date Helper](helpers/date_helper.html).

### Bug fixes:

* Fixed a bug (#3094) - `CI_Input::_clean_input_data()` breaks encrypted session cookies.
* Fixed a bug (#2268) - `CI_Security::xss_clean()` didn't properly match JavaScript events.
* Fixed a bug (#3309) - `CI_Security::xss_clean()` used an overly-invasive pattern to strip JS event handlers.

## Version 2.0.3

Release Date: August 20, 2011

* Security
  + An improvement was made to the MySQL and MySQLi drivers to prevent exposing a potential vector for SQL injection on sites using multi-byte character sets in the database client connection.

    An incompatibility in PHP versions < 5.2.3 and MySQL < 5.0.7 with *mysql\_set\_charset()* creates a situation where using multi-byte character sets on these environments may potentially expose a SQL injection attack vector. Latin-1, UTF-8, and other "low ASCII" character sets are unaffected on all environments.

    If you are running or considering running a multi-byte character set for your database connection, please pay close attention to the server environment you are deploying on to ensure you are not vulnerable.

  + Added an optional third parameter to `heading()` which allows adding html attributes to the rendered heading tag.
  + `form_open()` now only adds a hidden (Cross-site Reference Forgery) protection field when the form's action is internal and is set to the post method. (Reactor #165)
  + Re-worked `plural()` and `singular()` functions in the [Inflector helper](helpers/inflector_helper.html) to support considerably more words.
* Libraries
  + Altered Session to use a longer match against the user\_agent string. See upgrade notes if using database sessions.
  + Added `is_unique` to the [Form Validation library](libraries/form_validation.html).
  + Added `$this->db->set_dbprefix()` to the [Database Driver](database/queries.html).
  + Changed `$this->cart->insert()` in the [Cart Library](libraries/cart.html) to return the Row ID if a single item was inserted successfully.
  + Added `$this->load->get_var()` to the [Loader library](libraries/loader.html) to retrieve global vars set with `$this->load->view()` and `$this->load->vars()`.
  + Changed `$this->db->having()` to insert quotes using escape() rather than escape\_str().

### Bug fixes for 2.0.3

* Fixed a bug where not setting 'null' when adding fields in db\_forge for mysql and mysqli drivers would default to NULL instead of NOT NULL as the docs suggest.
* Fixed a bug where using `$this->db->select_max(), $this->db->select_min(), etc could throw notices. Thanks to w43l for the patch.`
* Replace checks for STDIN with php\_sapi\_name() == 'cli' which on the whole is more reliable. This should get parameters in crontab working.

We will leave it in the library folder for some time so that existing applications that use it will not break, but you are encouraged to migrate to the new version.
  + Updated the [Sessions class](libraries/sessions.html) so that any custom data being saved gets stored to a database rather than the session cookie (assuming you are using a database to store session data), permitting much more data to be saved.
  + Added the ability to store libraries in subdirectories within either the main "libraries" or the local application "libraries" folder. Please see the [Loader class](libraries/loader.html) for more info.
  + Added the ability to assign library objects to your own variable names when you use `$this->load->library()`. Please see the [Loader class](libraries/loader.html) for more info.

  + Added set\_status\_header() function to [Output class](libraries/output.html).
  + Modified [Pagination](libraries/pagination.html) class to only output the "First" link when the link for page one would not be shown.
  + Added support for mb\_strlen in the [Form Validation](libraries/form_validation.html) class so that multi-byte languages will calculate string lengths properly.
* Database
  + Improved Active Record class to allow full path column and table names: hostname.database.table.column. Also improved the alias handling.
  + Improved how table and column names are escaped and prefixed. It now honors full path names when adding prefixes and escaping.
  + Added Active Record caching feature to "update" and "delete" functions.
  + Added removal of non-printing control characters in `escape_str()` of DB drivers that do not have native PHP escaping mechanisms (mssql, oci8, odbc), to avoid potential SQL errors, and possible sources of SQL injection.
  + Added port support to MySQL, MySQLi, and MS SQL database drivers.
  + Added driver name variable in each DB driver, based on bug report #4436.
* Helpers
  + Added several new "setting" functions to the [Form helper](helpers/form_helper.html) that allow POST data to be retrieved and set into forms. These are intended to be used on their own, or with the new [Form Validation Class](libraries/form_validation.html).
  + Added `current_url()` and uri\_segments() to [URL helper](helpers/url_helper.html).
  + Altered `auto_link()` in the [URL helper](helpers/url_helper.html) so that email addresses with "+" included will be linked.
  + Added `meta()` function to [HTML helper](helpers/html_helper.html).
  + Improved accuracy of calculations in [Number helper](helpers/number_helper.html).
  + Removed added newlines ("\n") from most form and html helper functions.
  + Tightened up validation in the [Date helper](helpers/date_helper.html) function `human_to_unix()`, and eliminated the POSIX regex.
  + Updated [Date helper](helpers/date_helper.html) to match the world's current time zones and offsets.
  + Modified url\_title() in the [URL helper](helpers/url_helper.html) to remove characters and digits that are part of
    character entities, to allow dashes, underscores, and periods regardless of the $separator, and to allow uppercase characters.
  + Added support for arbitrary attributes in anchor\_popup() of the [URL helper](helpers/url_helper.html).
* Other Changes
  + Added [PHP Style Guide](./general/styleguide.html) to docs.
  + Added sanitization in `xss_clean()` for a deprecated HTML tag that could be abused in user input in Internet Explorer.
  + Added a few openxml document mime types, and an additional mobile agent to mimes.php and user\_agents.php respectively.
  + Added a file lock check during caching, before trying to write to the file.
  + Modified Cookie key cleaning to unset a few troublesome key names that can be present in certain environments, preventing CI from halting execution.
  + Changed the output of the profiler to use style attribute rather than clear, and added the id "codeigniter\_profiler" to the container div.

## Version 1.3.1

Release Date: April 11, 2006

* Added a [Unit Testing Library](./libraries/unit_testing.html).
* Added the ability to pass objects to the **insert()** and **update()** database functions.
  This feature enables you to (among other things) use your [Model class](./general/models.html) variables to run queries with. See the Models page for details.
* Added the ability to pass objects to the [view loading function](./general/views.html): $this->load->view('my\_view', $object);
* Added `getwhere` function to [Active Record class](./database/active_record.html).
* Added `count_all` function to [Active Record class](./database/active_record.html).
* Added language file for scaffolding and fixed a scaffolding bug that occurs when there are no rows in the specified table.
* Added [$this->db->last\_query()](./database/queries.html), which allows you to view your last query that was run.
* Added a new mime type to the upload class for better compatibility.
* Changed how cache files are read to prevent PHP errors if the cache file contains an XML tag, which PHP wants to interpret as a short tag.
* Fixed a bug in a couple of the active record functions (where and orderby).
* Fixed a bug in the image library when realpath() returns false.
* Fixed a bug in the Models that was preventing libraries from being used within them.
* Fixed a bug in the "exact\_length" function of the validation class.

## Version 1.3

Release Date: April 3, 2006

* Added support for [Models](models.html).
* Redesigned the database libraries to support additional RDBMs (Postgres, MySQLi, etc.).
* Redesigned the [Active Record class](./database/active_record.html) to enable more varied types of queries with simpler syntax, and advanced features like JOINs.
* Added a feature to the database class that lets you run [custom function calls](./database/call_function.html).
* Added support for [private functions](controllers.html) in your controllers. Any controller function name that starts with an underscore will not be served by a URI request.
* Added the ability to pass your own initialization parameters to your [custom core libraries](creating_libraries.html) when using $this->load->library()
* Added support for running standard [query string URLs](urls.html). These can be optionally enabled in your config file.
* Added the ability to [specify a "suffix"](urls.html), which will be appended to your URLs. For example, you could add .html to your URLs, making them appear static. This feature is enabled in your config file.
* Added a new error template for use with native PHP errors.
* Added "alternator" function in the [string helpers](./helpers/string_helper.html).
* Removed slashing from the input class. After much debate we decided to kill this feature.
* Change the commenting style in the scripts to the PEAR standard so that IDEs and tools like phpDocumenter can harvest the comments.
* Added better class and function name-spacing to avoid collisions with user developed classes. All CodeIgniter classes are now prefixed with CI\_ and
  all controller methods are prefixed with \_ci to avoid controller collisions. A list of reserved function names can be [found here](controllers.html).
* Redesigned how the "CI" super object is referenced, depending on whether PHP 4 or 5 is being run, since PHP 5 allows a more graceful way to manage objects that utilizes a bit less resources.
* Deprecated: $this->db->use\_table() has been deprecated. Please read the [Active Record](./database/active_record.html) page for information.
* Deprecated: $this->db->smart\_escape\_str() has been deprecated. Please use this instead: $this->db->escape()
* Fixed a bug in the exception handler which was preventing some PHP errors from showing up.
* Fixed a typo in the URI class. $this->total\_segment() should be plural: $this->total\_segments()
* Fixed some typos in the default calendar template
* Fixed some typos in the user guide

## Version 1.2

Release Date: March 21, 2006

* Redesigned some internal aspects of the framework to resolve scoping problems that surfaced during the beta tests. The problem was most notable when instantiating classes in your constructors, particularly if those classes in turn did work in their constructors.
* Added a global function named [get\_instance()](ancillary_classes.html) allowing the main CodeIgniter object to be accessible throughout your own classes.
* Added new [File Helper](./helpers/file_helper.html): delete\_files()
* Added new [URL Helpers](./helpers/url_helper.html): base\_url(), index\_page()
* Added the ability to create your own [core libraries](creating_libraries.html) and store them in your local application directory.
* Added an `overwrite` option to the [Upload class](./libraries/file_uploading.html), enabling files to be overwritten rather than having the file name appended.
* Added Javascript Calendar plugin.
* Added search feature to user guide. Note: This is done using Google, which at the time of this writing has not crawled all the pages of the docs.
* Updated the parser class so that it allows tag pars within other tag pairs.
* Fixed a bug in the DB "where" function.
* Fixed a bug that was preventing custom config files to be auto-loaded.
