Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-4891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in CodeIgniter's `xss_clean()` function. This function was designed to sanitize user input by stripping potentially malicious JavaScript code. However, it failed to properly handle HTML tags that were not closed with a closing ">".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insufficient input sanitization:** The `xss_clean()` function did not fully strip attributes from HTML tags that lacked a closing `>`.
-   **Browser parsing behavior:** Web browsers are capable of parsing unclosed HTML tags and interpreting them as if they were properly formed.
-   **Blacklist approach:** The `xss_clean()` function uses a blacklist approach, making it vulnerable to bypasses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the victim's browser when they access a page with the unsanitized input.
-   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By using techniques like `eval` and `atob`, attackers could execute virtually any JavaScript code.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Input:** The primary attack vector involves injecting specially crafted HTML containing unclosed tags via any input field.
-  **Unclosed HTML Tags:** Specifically crafting an HTML tag that is missing the closing ">" character. For example, `<img src="a" onerror='eval(atob("cHJvbXB0KDEpOw=="))'`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to inject input:** Attackers must be able to inject input into a web application that uses the vulnerable version of CodeIgniter and its `xss_clean()` function. This input could come from form fields, URL parameters, or other user-controlled sources.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability was patched in CodeIgniter version 2.1.4.
-   The provided content emphasizes that `xss_clean()` is not a reliable solution for preventing XSS attacks due to its blacklist nature and previous bypasses. Developers are advised to use more robust sanitization techniques.
-   The vulnerability was reported through responsible disclosure.
