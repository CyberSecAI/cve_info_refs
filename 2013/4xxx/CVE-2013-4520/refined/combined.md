# CVE Request: additional fix for CVE-2012-2825 libxslt crash

---

*From*: Marcus Meissner <meissner () suse de>

*Date*: Tue, 5 Nov 2013 13:50:09 +0100

```
Hi,

Our QA found that the reproducer in CVE-2012-2825 (magic.xsl and magic.xml)
also expose another libxslt crash in older libxslt versions.

<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=849019>

This bug was fixed in libxslt 1.1.25 with this commit:
<https://gitorious.org/libxslt/libxslt/commit/7089a62b8f133b42a2981cf1f920a8b3fe9a8caa>

commit 7089a62b8f133b42a2981cf1f920a8b3fe9a8caa
Author: Martin <gzlist () googlemail com>
Date:   Wed Sep 16 19:02:16 2009 +0200

    Crash compiling stylesheet with DTD

    * libxslt/xslt.c: when a stylesheet embbeds a DTD the compilation
      process could get seriously wrong

Crash as a xmlDtd struct is accessed as a xmlNode, not really attacker controllable
I would say, but a denial of service (crash).

Ciao, Marcus

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

As you probably saw, I commented in your bug regarding this and now that
I've seen this I did some further digging.

The reason this doesn't crash for me on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 which
ships 1.1.17 is because we included this patch (well, the developer did)
a day after the initial build with the comment:

- CVE-2012-2825 requires an extra patch on 1.1.17

So, I think this does require a second CVE.  This also explains why I
didn't see any crashes with our updated packages because we already have
this patch.
