Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4520:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an error in how `libxslt` handles DTDs embedded within XSL stylesheets during the compilation process. Specifically, a `xmlDtd` struct was incorrectly accessed as a `xmlNode`. This issue is described as an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-2825.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Type Casting:** The core weakness is the incorrect type casting of a `xmlDtd` structure to `xmlNode`, leading to a memory access error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the `libxslt` library, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XSL Stylesheet:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted XSL stylesheet containing a DTD that triggers the incorrect memory access. This could be done through processing untrusted stylesheets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply a malicious XSL file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide or cause the application to process a specially crafted XSL file. This might be achievable by convincing a user to open a malicious file or through a web application that allows the upload/processing of XSL files.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability since the issue occurs during the compilation process.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in `libxslt` version 1.1.25 with the commit `7089a62b8f133b42a2981cf1f920a8b3fe9a8caa`.
*   The vulnerability is an addendum to CVE-2012-2825, meaning it was found by continuing to test the fix for the prior vulnerability.
*   The issue is not directly attacker-controlled in the sense that the attacker cannot directly control the value of the invalid pointer. However, the attacker can control if a crash occurs by crafting a specific stylesheet.

The information provided goes into more detail than the standard CVE description by explaining the type confusion leading to the crash and the need for a second CVE to account for the incomplete fix to CVE-2012-2825.
