Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2013-4655:

**CVE-2013-4655 is not explicitly mentioned**, however, the provided documents extensively discuss vulnerabilities in SOHO routers. The content describes a wide range of vulnerabilities, some of which may be related to the CVE but there is no explicit mention.
The document titled **"Exploiting SOHO Routers"** is a good summary of the findings and provides a good high level overview of the vulnerabilities. The document titled **"SOHO Network Equipment...and the implications of a rich service set"** provides a more in-depth technical view.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Multiple vulnerabilities:** The research identified 55 previously undisclosed security vulnerabilities.
*   **Extraneous services:** Many SOHO routers include services unrelated to basic routing, like NAS features (SMB, FTP, UPnP), and other services for system optimization which increases the attack surface.
*   **Misconfiguration of services:** Services often have inadequate configuration options and overly lenient permissions. This includes allowing symbolic links in SMB to traverse the file system.
*   **Assumption of security on the (W)LAN:** Routers often lack secure connections for sensitive data between the router and clients and services often lack authentication.
*   **Insecure default configurations:** Routers often have insecure features enabled by default, lack proper privilege control, use outdated technology, and have weak or public credentials.
*   **Poor security design:** Lack of input validation, leading to vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Directory Traversal, and Command Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer overflows:** Found in network services like the Broadcom ACSD service, TRENDnet KC_FTP and KC_SMB servers, and Broadcom RC network config binary, often leading to full administrative control.
*   **Unauthenticated read/write access to storage:**  Attached USB storage is accessible without authentication by default.
*   **Permissive file permissions:**  World-writable access to critical files or directories, allowing attackers to overwrite system files or gain access to credentials.
*   **Service misconfiguration:**  Samba servers allowing symbolic link creation, enabling file system traversal.
*   **Clear text storage of sensitive data:** Passwords stored in plaintext in configuration files.
*   **Web application vulnerabilities:** CSRF, directory traversal, and command injection flaws in the web interface.
*   **Race conditions:**  Abuse of race conditions in some router’s webservers that can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Backdoors:** Intentional methods of bypassing authentication to gain administrative access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Router Control:**  Attackers can gain full control of the router's configuration, operating system, and network traffic.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**  Attackers can intercept and modify network traffic, poison DNS, perform denial-of-service attacks, and impersonate servers.
*   **Network Compromise:**  Compromised routers can be used to attack other devices on the local network, bypassing firewall protections.
*   **Botnet Deployment:** Compromised routers can be leveraged for botnet activities.
*   **"Bricking" of devices:** An attacker can replace vendor firmware with faulty firmware, rendering the device unusable.
*   **Large-scale threats:** If ISPs deploy vulnerable routers, attackers could use them to attack core infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local network (LAN/WLAN):** Attackers on the local network can exploit many vulnerabilities without authentication or credentials.
*   **Remote network (WAN):** In some cases, vulnerabilities are exploitable from the WAN side, especially if remote administration is enabled.
*   **Web Browser Exploits:** Client-side attacks using HTML and JavaScript code are also possible.
*   **Network Services Exploitation:** Direct exploitation of vulnerable services such as FTP, SMB, or Telnet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **LAN/WLAN Access:** Most attacks require access to the local network (wired or wireless).
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerabilities:** Some attacks require detailed knowledge of specific vulnerabilities and may need custom exploit code.
*   **Basic Network Skills:**  Attackers need to understand basic networking concepts.
*   **No User Interaction (in some cases):** Some vulnerabilities can be exploited without user interaction or active management sessions.
*   **User Interaction Required (in some cases):** Some attacks might require user interaction to follow a malicious link or browse to an unsafe page.
*   **Credentials Required (in some cases):** Some attacks might require default credentials or a valid user session.

**Additional Details**

*   The research covers 13 different routers.
*   The research provides mitigations for vendors, administrators, and end users.
*   Proof-of-concept attacks demonstrate exploiting several vulnerabilities in different routers.
*   The research lists CVEs associated with other discovered vulnerabilities.

**Relation to CVE-2013-4655**

While CVE-2013-4655 is not directly referenced, the research reveals that many SOHO routers were vulnerable to SMB symlink traversal. This vulnerability is mentioned several times in the content, including:
* "Due to a misconfiguration in the SMB service, symbolic links can be created to locations outside of the Samba share"
* "All routers in this study, except the TRENDnet TEW­812DRU, permitted the creation and traversal of symbolic links over SMB."

Based on the context, CVE-2013-4655 could be an SMB symlink traversal vulnerability, though more context is needed to verify.
