      "Source": "CVE",
      "Curation": "Uncurated",
      "Timestamp": "2025-01-26T11:45:03Z"
    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Description": "File injection vulnerability in Ruby gem Features 0.3.0 allows remote attackers to inject malicious html in the /tmp directory.",
      "RootCause": "The Ruby gem Features 0.3.0 creates a temporary HTML file in the /tmp directory using a predictable filename ('/tmp/out.html').  A malicious user can create this file first and repeatedly write to it, injecting malicious HTML content.  The gem then opens this file, causing the injected HTML to be executed.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
         "File Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary HTML injection, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in other gem users' browsers.",
      "AttackVectors": [
        "Local file system access to /tmp directory"
      ],
       "RequiredCapabilities": [
        "Ability to create and write to files in the `/tmp` directory"
      ]
    }
