Subject: Features 0.3.0 Ruby gem /tmp file injection vulnerability

Hi, May I have a CVE for the following vulnerability?

Title: Features 0.3.0 Ruby gem /tmp file injection vulnerability

Date: 9/1/2013
Author: Larry W. Cashdollar @_larry0
Download: <http://rubygems.org/gems/features>
CVE: TBD
Description: "Plaintext User Stories Parser supporting native programming languages. Especially Objective-C"
Same vulnerability as <http://vapid.dhs.org/advisories/show_in_browser.html>
By a malicious user creating /tmp/out.html first and repeatedly writing to it they can inject malicious html into the file right before it is about to be opened.
PoC:
nobody () sp0rk:/$ while (true); do echo "<script> alert('Hello'); </script>" >> /tmp/out.html; done
Will pop up a java script alert in other gem users browser.
Code:
Vulnerabile code in ./features-0.3.0/lib/suite.rb

html = parse_results(results).html
%x(touch '/tmp/out.html' && echo '#{html}' > /tmp/out.html && open '/tmp/out.html' ) end
def parse_results_and_open_in_safari(results) -- end
def open_in_safari(html)
%x(touch '/tmp/out.html' && echo '#{html}' > /tmp/out.html && open '/tmp/out.html' ) end

Vendor: Not notified
Content of type "text/html" skipped

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
