**TYPO3-EXT-SA-2013-007: Several vulnerabilities in third party extensions**

This advisory details multiple vulnerabilities found in several third-party TYPO3 extensions. Here's a breakdown of each:

**1. Extension: Library for Frontend plugins (sg_zfelib)**

*   **Affected Versions:** 1.1.774 and all versions below
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Arbitrary Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, File Disclosure
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Root Cause:** The specific vulnerability details are not provided but the impact indicates a severe flaw allowing for code execution, privilege escalation, and unauthorized access to files.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the system is possible due to the ability to execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges. Attackers can also gain access to sensitive files on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Not specified, but likely through a flaw in how the extension handles user input or interacts with the system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** It is implied that remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability.

**2. Extension: Library for Frontend plugins (sg_zlib)**

*   **Affected Versions:** 0.2.991 and all versions below
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Arbitrary Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, File Disclosure
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Root Cause:** Similar to `sg_zfelib`, the exact flaw isn't specified but the impact suggests a severe vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, and unauthorized file access.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized data access, and the ability to run malicious code.
*    **Attack Vectors:** Not specified, but likely through a flaw in how the extension handles user input or interacts with the system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** It is implied that remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability.

**3. Extension: meta_feedit (meta_feedit)**

*   **Affected Versions:** 0.1.10 and all versions below
*   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Root Cause:** The extension is vulnerable to SQL injection, likely due to improper sanitization of user input before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could read, modify, or delete data from the database. This can lead to data breaches, website defacement, or complete control over the data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through user-supplied input fields or parameters processed by the extension.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability.

**4. Extension: Accessible browse results for indexed search (accessible_is_browse_results)**

*   **Affected Versions:** 1.2.1 and all versions below
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Severity:** Medium
*  **Root Cause:** The extension does not properly sanitize user input when displaying search results, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, user redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By injecting malicious code via the search functionality, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability when other users view the search results.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote, unauthenticated users can inject code, and other users that view the page are impacted.

**5. Extension: Maag Form Captcha (maag_formcaptcha)**

*   **Affected Versions:** 2.0.0 and all versions below
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Open Redirection
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Root Cause:** The extension has an open redirection vulnerability, potentially due to improper handling of the redirect URL.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites via the form captcha, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware downloads.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating the redirect URL parameter, the attacker can force the extension to redirect users to an attacker-controlled website.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote, unauthenticated users can exploit this vulnerability.

**6. Extension: SB Folderdownload (sb_folderdownload)**

*   **Affected Versions:** 1.1.1 and all versions below
*   **Vulnerability Type:** File Disclosure
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Root Cause:** The extension has a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to files.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive files on the server, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The exact mechanism is not detailed but likely involves manipulating parameters or paths to access protected files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attackers, likely unauthenticated.

**7. Extension: TEQneers SEO Enhancements (tq_seo)**

*   **Affected Versions:** 5.0.0 and all versions below
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Root Cause:** The extension lacks proper CSRF protection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions in the application on behalf of a logged-in user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Through a malicious website or email, an attacker could craft a request that a userâ€™s browser unknowingly sends to the vulnerable application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into accessing a crafted malicious link or webpage.

**8. Extension: jQuery autocomplete for indexed_search (rzautocomplete)**

*   **Affected Versions:** 0.0.8 and all versions below
*    **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Root Cause:** Similar to `meta_feedit`, this extension suffers from SQL injection due to improper handling of user input in database queries.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can read, modify, or delete data from the database. This can lead to data breaches, website defacement, or complete control over the data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By injecting malicious SQL code through the autocomplete functionality, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attackers.
