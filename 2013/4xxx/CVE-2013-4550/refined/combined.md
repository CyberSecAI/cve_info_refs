**Description**

Lately, I've occasionally received errors in my client saying "Unknown message '28126:error:1407609C:SSL', The IRC server received a message it did not understand.", typing 'lsof -i' on the machine bip is running on would then show there was an incoming connection from a weird, foreign IP address to bip, which ended up in CLOSED\_WAIT state.

My theory on why this happens is this: when using SSL (client\_side\_ssl = true), bip will write an error to stderr when the SSL handshake fails. However, if it is running as a daemon, stderr will have been closed. This means that it is likely that this file descriptor is now used as a connection to a server or client. So when something connects and tries to send something that isn't a valid SSL handshake, bip will print an error to the server, which then responds that it doesn't understand that message. This could even allow an attacker to, for example, cause bip to send a lot of malformed messages and get disconnected from the server.

This happens because there is a BIO\* struct created that is initialized with stderr (src/connection.c:1206) for handling SSL errors. It would be better if this were printed to the global log file.

Also, when an SSL handshake error occurs, a socket is never closed, but remains in CLOSE\_WAIT state forever. This happens because a socket that is set to have an error will never be closed (src/connection.c:57).

I'm attaching a patch that fixed both of these problems.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Subject: Re: Duplicated CVE assignment for bip

Moritz,

These are two slightly different issues, although a casual reading of the
descriptions does not make that sufficiently clear.

The original CNA assignment of CVE-2013-4550 did not consider that there
appear to be two different types of issues, which means a SPLIT of the CVE
ID.

The issues are disclosed in Bug 261 here:

<https://projects.duckcorp.org/issues/261>

The first issue is that Bip will write to arbitrary sockets when run in
daemon mode because stderr is closed: "when using SSL (client_side_ssl =
true), bip will write an error to stderr when the SSL handshake fails.
However, if it is running as a daemon, stderr will have been closed."

We narrowed the scope of CVE-2013-4550 to this first issue.  Note that
while the bug was apparently filed and public in 2011, it was given a
CVE-2013-xxxx ID, but we don't usually reject an ID simply because it is
out of sync with the disclosure date.  We also didn't see a need to REJECT
this CVE because of the scope change either, since it's in reasonably wide
use.

The second issue covers connections that are never closed: "Also, when an
SSL handshake error occurs, a socket is never closed, but remains in
CLOSE_WAIT state forever. This happens because a socket that is set to
have an error will never be closed."

A fix for the first issue would not necessarily guarantee a fix of the
second issue, and the bugs are of different types.  Therefore the second
issue is SPLIT from the first.  We assigned CVE-2011-5268 accordingly,
since at the time of assignment, we knew that 2011 was the disclosure
date.

When we published these CVEs, we probably should have notified
oss-security, or at least modified CVE-2011-5268 and CVE-2013-4550's
descriptions to reflect the close relationships.  I apologize for that.

- Steve

Lately, I've occasionally received errors in my client saying "Unknown message '28126:error:1407609C:SSL', The IRC server received a message it did not understand.", typing 'lsof -i' on the machine bip is running on would then show there was an incoming connection from a weird, foreign IP address to bip, which ended up in CLOSED\_WAIT state.

1. Enable client side ssl in bip.conf:
   ```

   client_side_ssl = true;
   client_side_ssl_pem = "/tmp/testcert.pem";

   ```
2. comments all connections in bip.conf
3. use "telnet 127.0.0.1 7778"
4. run another "telnet 127.0.0.1 7778"
5. types some characters inside the first `telnet`
6. Second telnet receive "16240:error:140760FC:SSL routines:SSL23\_GET\_CLIENT\_HELLO:unknown protocol:s23\_srvr.c:578:"

Without the patch `telnet` doesn't stop. With the patch first `telnet` ends with "Connection closed by foreign host.".
