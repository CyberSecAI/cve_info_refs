Overview:

The OpenStack Security SIG actively works to improve OpenStack security through improvements to code, architecture and various documentation efforts including vulnerability management (through the Vulnerability Management Team) and issuing of Security Notes.

The primary focus points for the security team are:

(1) Securing the OpenStack code base

(2) Providing deployers with the documentation needed to make sound security choices when deploying or consuming OpenStack

(3) Helping address security needs in a cross project collaborative way.

Author and maintain the OpenStack Security Guide:

\* <http://docs.openstack.org/sec/>

The security team conducts all non-confidential business on the openstack-sig mailing list with the [Security] tag.

\* Subscribe: <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-sigs>

We previously used the openstack-security mailing list

\* Archive: <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-sigs/>

Advisory Activities:

\* Act as a consultancy group for OpenStack developers

\* The Vulnerability Management Team (VMT) exists as a subset of the Security SIG

\* VMT confidentially handles vulnerability disclosures

\* The wider security SIG can confirm vulnerability severity at the request of the VMT

Security Guidance:

\* OpenStack Security Notes provide Security Guidance on OpenStack Configuration and Usage: <https://launchpad.net/ossn/>

\* Issued Security Notes: <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security_Notes>

Research Activities:

\* Exploits / Proofs of Concept

\* Vulnerability Research

\* Threat Verification

\* Hardening

\* Security Architecture

\* Secure OpenStack Provisioning

\* Documenting Security Features

\* Configuration Management

\* Site Survey Functionality / Security Dashboard

\* More

Membership:

In April 2015 the Security SIG became an official part of OpenStack. Previously the security team was comprised of two separate organisations; the VMT and the OSSG. The VMT was a small team handling critical vulnerability reports and remediation whereas the OSSG formed the bulk of the remaining security activities within OpenStack. In early 2015 these teams merged, this was quickly followed by the Security team being accepted into OpenStack.

History of the OSSG:

Originally instigated in 2012 by HP and Nebula, the OSSG initially sought to work on an invite only basis, seeking to draw in contributors from large OpenStack teams such as Rackspace, Ubuntu and Red Hat. The team has grown significantly in size and function and now works on a moderated list model, we're open to contributors of all types and the list is moderated simply to keep out spammers.

In early 2018 what was the Security Project became the Security SIG

Security GIG Code of Ethics:

Members of the security team agree that the goals of the group are to improve the security of OpenStack. Information made available to the security team may at times be sensitive and should always be treated as confidential, not to be shared outside of the group. Members are expressly prohibited from profiting by sharing vulnerability or exploit information obtained from the security team with a third party. All group members agree to abide by industry best practices in responsible disclosure, including providing proper attribution for any technical contributions.

Leadership:

The security SIG has no formal leadership, instead it has chairs, with the current chairs being Luke Hinds (Red Hat) and Gage Hugo (AT&T).

Leadership Functions:

\* Formal liaison with OpenStack teams

\* Security team co-ordination

\* Driving Security Awareness

\* Providing Suggestions for Research Direction

\* More

Ongoing Tasks for the Security SIG:

\* Recruiting security talent

\* Evangelizing security within the community

\* Document current best practices - useful as a documentation exercise and for understanding next steps. (e.g., if best practices involve strongly isolating a particular component b/c it is riddled with security issues, then that will help reveal where we should be working)

\* Develop stress tests that can be integrated with current testing

# [Openstack] [OSSG][OSSN] Authenticated users are able to update passwords without providing their current password

Hash: SHA1

Authenticated users are able to update passwords without providing
their current password
- ---

### Summary ###
An authenticated user is able to change their password without
providing their current password. This allows compromised
authentication tokens to be used to permanently compromise a user account.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Horizon, Keystone, Identity, Grizzly

### Discussion ###
Horizon allows a user to change their own password, which uses the
Identity API to perform the password change. A user is required to
supply their current password to successfully perform a password
change. This requirement prevents a malicious user from stealing a
user's authentication token and changing that user's password to
permanently compromise their account. With this additional password
check, a compromised authentication token only compromises the user
account until the token is no longer valid due to expiration or
revocation.

When using the Identity v3 API, a user is able to successfully change
their password without supplying the correct current password. This
leaves users vulnerable to permanently compromised accounts if their
authentication token is compromised. The Identity v2 API is not
vulnerable to this issue, as it has a separate API call for updating
user passwords that properly validates the current password.

### Recommended Actions ###
In the OpenStack Grizzly release, a user is allowed to update the
attributes in their own entry by default. It is recommended that you
restrict user updates to only be allowed by admin users. This is done
by setting the "update_user" policy to "admin_required" in Keystone's
policy.json file. Here is an example snippet of a properly configured
policy.json file:

- ---- begin example policy.json snippet ----
    "identity:get_user": [["rule:admin_required"]],
    "identity:list_users": [["rule:admin_required"]],
    "identity:create_user": [["rule:admin_required"]],
    "identity:update_user": [["rule:admin_required"]],
    "identity:delete_user": [["rule:admin_required"]],
- ---- end example policy.json snippet ----

This change has the side-effect of restricting a user from updating
any of their own attributes, not just their password.

In the OpenStack Havana release, the default policy is to only allow
admin users to update attributes in user entries. In addition, Horizon
will not allow a user to change their own password if it is using the
Identity v3 API, even if Keystone is configured to allow users to
update their own entries. Despite this restriction in Horizon, it is
recommended to leave the default "update_user" policy setting as is,
as an attacker could target Keystone directly without using Horizon to
initiate a password change.

I'm thinking of introducing at least two new API's targeted at consumption by end users in icehouse, for example:

/v3/users/{user\_id}/password

  /v3/users/{user\_id}/default\_project\_id

I'll be adding functionality for these calls to the client after they land on the service side.

With the proposed fix I see two sides in this issue: an unfortunate default (update\_user not being restricted to admin\_required) and a v3 API gap (no way for users to update password in a secure manner).

This makes this OSSN territory: we need to warn users that they may not be as secure as they think with the Grizzly default and should consider changing it.

Havana should have the "right" default. Icehouse should add the missing API call, completing the strengthening.

Thoughts ?

the proposed "fix" for horizon is to disable password updates by users, when keystone is using v3. IMHO that's unfortunate.

The other "fix" would be, not to require admin privileges and to check, if the given password was right. That leaves the server side insecure.

I can't see, how adding a function to keystone v3 will break functionality. Release-wise, this will hurt the schedule, no question.

Still, I'd vote to slip the release and to implement a fix ASAP.

Authenticated users are able to update passwords without providing their current password

---

### Summary ###

An authenticated user is able to change their password without providing their current password. This allows compromised authentication tokens to be used to permanently compromise a user account.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Horizon, Keystone, Identity, Grizzly

### Discussion ###

Horizon allows a user to change their own password, which uses the Identity API to perform the password change. A user is required to supply their current password to successfully perform a password change. This requirement prevents a malicious user from stealing a users authentication token and changing that user's password to permanently compromise their account. With this additional password check, a compromised authentication token only compromises the user account until the token is no longer valid due to expiration or revocation.

When using the Identity v3 API, a user is able to successfully change their password without supplying the correct current password. This leaves users vulnerable to permanently compromised accounts if their authentication token is compromised. The Identity v2 API is not vulnerable to this issue, as it has a separate API call for updating user passwords that properly validates the current password.

### Recommended Actions ###

In the OpenStack Grizzly release, a user is allowed to update the attributes in their own entry by default. It is recommended that you restrict user updates to only be allowed by admin users. This is done by setting the "update\_user" policy to "admin\_required" in Keystone's policy.json file. Here is an example snippet of a properly configured policy.json file:

---- begin example policy.json snippet ----

    "identity:get\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:list\_users": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:create\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:update\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:delete\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

---- end example policy.json snippet ----

This change has the side-effect of restricting a user from updating any of their own attributes, not just their password.

In the OpenStack Havana release, the default policy is to only allow admin users to update attributes in user entries. In addition, Horizon will not allow a user to change their own password if it is using the Identity v3 API, even if Keystone is configured to allow users to update their own entries. Despite this restriction in Horizon, it is recommended to leave the default "update\_user" policy setting as is, as an attacker could target Keystone directly without using Horizon to initiate a password change.

In the OpenStack Havana release, the default policy is to only allow admin users to update attributes in user entries. In addition, Horizon will not allow a user to change their own password if it is using the Identity v3 API, even if Keystone is configured to allow users to update their own entries. Despite this restriction in Horizon, it is recommended to leave the default "update\_user" policy setting as is, as an attacker could target Keystone directly without using Horizon to initiate a password change.

What would now be the recommended way for a user to update their own password, using Keystone? Could a update\_own\_password method similar to v2 be added to the client?

I'm thinking of introducing at least two new API's targeted at consumption by end users in icehouse, for example:

/v3/users/{user\_id}/password

  /v3/users/{user\_id}/default\_project\_id

I'll be adding functionality for these calls to the client after they land on the service side.

With the proposed fix I see two sides in this issue: an unfortunate default (update\_user not being restricted to admin\_required) and a v3 API gap (no way for users to update password in a secure manner).

This makes this OSSN territory: we need to warn users that they may not be as secure as they think with the Grizzly default and should consider changing it.

Havana should have the "right" default. Icehouse should add the missing API call, completing the strengthening.

Thoughts ?

the proposed "fix" for horizon is to disable password updates by users, when keystone is using v3. IMHO that's unfortunate.

The other "fix" would be, not to require admin privileges and to check, if the given password was right. That leaves the server side insecure.

I can't see, how adding a function to keystone v3 will break functionality. Release-wise, this will hurt the schedule, no question.

Still, I'd vote to slip the release and to implement a fix ASAP.

We need to warn Grizzly users that they may not be as secure as they think with the Grizzly default for "user\_update" policy and should consider changing it to "admin\_required".

Authenticated users are able to update passwords without providing their current password

---

### Summary ###

An authenticated user is able to change their password without providing their current password. This allows compromised authentication tokens to be used to permanently compromise a user account.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Horizon, Keystone, Identity, Grizzly

### Discussion ###

Horizon allows a user to change their own password, which uses the Identity API to perform the password change. A user is required to supply their current password to successfully perform a password change. This requirement prevents a malicious user from stealing a users authentication token and changing that user's password to permanently compromise their account. With this additional password check, a compromised authentication token only compromises the user account until the token is no longer valid due to expiration or revocation.

When using the Identity v3 API, a user is able to successfully change their password without supplying the correct current password. This leaves users vulnerable to permanently compromised accounts if their authentication token is compromised. The Identity v2 API is not vulnerable to this issue, as it has a separate API call for updating user passwords that properly validates the current password.

### Recommended Actions ###

In the OpenStack Grizzly release, a user is allowed to update the attributes in their own entry by default. It is recommended that you restrict user updates to only be allowed by admin users. This is done by setting the "update\_user" policy to "admin\_required" in Keystone's policy.json file. Here is an example snippet of a properly configured policy.json file:

---- begin example policy.json snippet ----

    "identity:get\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:list\_users": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:create\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:update\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:delete\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

---- end example policy.json snippet ----

This change has the side-effect of restricting a user from updating any of their own attributes, not just their password.

In the OpenStack Havana release, the default policy is to only allow admin users to update attributes in user entries. In addition, Horizon will not allow a user to change their own password if it is using the Identity v3 API, even if Keystone is configured to allow users to update their own entries. Despite this restriction in Horizon, it is recommended to leave the default "update\_user" policy setting as is, as an attacker could target Keystone directly without using Horizon to initiate a password change.

Great OSSN, I'd say it'd ready to publish pretty much.

In the third sentence of the discussion "a users" needs to read "a user's"

What would now be the recommended way for a user to update their own password, using Keystone? Could a update\_own\_password method similar to v2 be added to the client?

I'm thinking of introducing at least two new API's targeted at consumption by end users in icehouse, for example:

/v3/users/{user\_id}/password

  /v3/users/{user\_id}/default\_project\_id

I'll be adding functionality for these calls to the client after they land on the service side.

With the proposed fix I see two sides in this issue: an unfortunate default (update\_user not being restricted to admin\_required) and a v3 API gap (no way for users to update password in a secure manner).

This makes this OSSN territory: we need to warn users that they may not be as secure as they think with the Grizzly default and should consider changing it.

Havana should have the "right" default. Icehouse should add the missing API call, completing the strengthening.

Thoughts ?

the proposed "fix" for horizon is to disable password updates by users, when keystone is using v3. IMHO that's unfortunate.

The other "fix" would be, not to require admin privileges and to check, if the given password was right. That leaves the server side insecure.

I can't see, how adding a function to keystone v3 will break functionality. Release-wise, this will hurt the schedule, no question.

Still, I'd vote to slip the release and to implement a fix ASAP.

Authenticated users are able to update passwords without providing their current password

---

### Summary ###

An authenticated user is able to change their password without providing their current password. This allows compromised authentication tokens to be used to permanently compromise a user account.

### Affected Services / Software ###

Horizon, Keystone, Identity, Grizzly

### Discussion ###

Horizon allows a user to change their own password, which uses the Identity API to perform the password change. A user is required to supply their current password to successfully perform a password change. This requirement prevents a malicious user from stealing a users authentication token and changing that user's password to permanently compromise their account. With this additional password check, a compromised authentication token only compromises the user account until the token is no longer valid due to expiration or revocation.

When using the Identity v3 API, a user is able to successfully change their password without supplying the correct current password. This leaves users vulnerable to permanently compromised accounts if their authentication token is compromised. The Identity v2 API is not vulnerable to this issue, as it has a separate API call for updating user passwords that properly validates the current password.

### Recommended Actions ###

In the OpenStack Grizzly release, a user is allowed to update the attributes in their own entry by default. It is recommended that you restrict user updates to only be allowed by admin users. This is done by setting the "update\_user" policy to "admin\_required" in Keystone's policy.json file. Here is an example snippet of a properly configured policy.json file:

---- begin example policy.json snippet ----

    "identity:get\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:list\_users": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:create\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:update\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

    "identity:delete\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],

---- end example policy.json snippet ----

This change has the side-effect of restricting a user from updating any of their own attributes, not just their password.

In the OpenStack Havana release, the default policy is to only allow admin users to update attributes in user entries. In addition, Horizon will not allow a user to change their own password if it is using the Identity v3 API, even if Keystone is configured to allow users to update their own entries. Despite this restriction in Horizon, it is recommended to leave the default "update\_user" policy setting as is, as an attacker could target Keystone directly without using Horizon to initiate a password change.

In the OpenStack Grizzly release, a user is allowed to update the attributes in their own entry by default. It is recommended that you restrict user updates to only be allowed by admin users. This is done by setting the "update\_user" policy to "admin\_required" in Keystone's policy.json file. Here is an example snippet of a properly configured policy.json file:
---- begin example policy.json snippet ----
"identity:get\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],
"identity:list\_users": [["rule:admin\_required"]],
"identity:create\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],
"identity:update\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],
"identity:delete\_user": [["rule:admin\_required"]],
---- end example policy.json snippet ----
This change has the side-effect of restricting a user from updating any of their own attributes, not just their password.
In the OpenStack Havana release, the default policy is to only allow admin users to update attributes in user entries. In addition, Horizon will not allow a user to change their own password if it is using the Identity v3 API, even if Keystone is configured to allow users to update their own entries. Despite this restriction in Horizon, it is recommended to leave the default "update\_user" policy setting as is, as an attacker could target Keystone directly without using Horizon to initiate a password change.
