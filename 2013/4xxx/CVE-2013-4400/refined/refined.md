Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `virt-login-shell` program, a setuid-root executable, failed to properly sanitize environment variables and command-line arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input sanitization
- Usage of a setuid-root program with flawed input handling

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local user could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files as root, leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation, where a user manipulates environment variables or command-line arguments passed to `virt-login-shell`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A local user account on the system where `virt-login-shell` is installed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in libvirt 1.1.2.
*   Red Hat states that their libvirt packages shipped with RHEL 5 and 6 were not vulnerable.
*   The issue was reported by Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team.
*   Patches were committed upstream to address this issue.
*   The fix involved closing all non-stdio file descriptors, only allowing 'stderr' logging and preventing linking `virt-login-shell` against `libvirt.so`.
