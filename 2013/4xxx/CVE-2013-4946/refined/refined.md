The provided content is related to CVE-2013-4946.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper input sanitization leading to SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in BMC Service Desk Express (SDE) version 10.2.1.95.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection in multiple parameters accessed via cookies and a form parameter.
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in multiple parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL injection could allow an attacker to extract sensitive data, modify data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Reflected XSS could allow an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- SQL Injection: By manipulating cookie values (`ASPSESSIONIDASSRATTQ`, `TABLE_WIDGET_1`, `TABLE_WIDGET_2`, `browserDateTimeInfo`, `browserNumberInfo`) and the `UID` form parameter in HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Reflected XSS: By crafting malicious URLs containing JavaScript code within the `SelTab`, `CallBack`, and `HelpPage` parameters, and then tricking a user into accessing the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. For SQL injection, it would likely involve having a user session or the ability to manipulate cookies. For XSS, the attacker needs to entice a user to click a malicious link.
