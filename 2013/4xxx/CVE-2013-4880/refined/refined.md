Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the `core/admin/modules/developer/modules/views/add.php` file of the BigTree-CMS.
- The code was directly using the `$_GET["module"]` parameter without proper sanitization before displaying it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input from the `$_GET["module"]` parameter which is then outputted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the `module` GET parameter. When a user views this page, the malicious script would be executed in their browser.
-   The impact could include session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting the user to a malicious site, and potentially defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through a crafted URL with a malicious `module` parameter, which could be distributed via email or embedded in another website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a user. The user must be authenticated to the BigTree-CMS system and have access to the vulnerable page.

**Code Changes:**
The commit addresses the XSS by using `htmlspecialchars()` function to sanitize the input from `$_GET["module"]` parameter before it is used.
