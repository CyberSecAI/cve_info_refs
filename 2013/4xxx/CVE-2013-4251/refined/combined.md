Hi Julian,

Cc'ing Julian directly as per short discussion on IRC.

On IRC you mentioned that you are looking at this issue. Did you had a
chance to prepare the upload for unstable?

I can otherwise try to prepare a NMU with the given patch only, if
needed.

p.s.: Note it was decided to tag this as 'no-dsa' but fixing this for
      stable and oldstable trough a (o)pu would still be welcome.

Regards,
Salvatore

I have prepared updates for unstable, wheezy and squeeze, which require
sponsoring:

<http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/python-modules/packages/scipy/branches/>

for wheezy and squeeze a little extra checking if the
packaging/versioning is done correctly is appreciated as this is my
first stable update in debian.

Tested the packages by running scipys testsuite and a couple weave
commands on all supported python versions.

Thanks for you update. I only had a look at the unstable version (so
far at least), and looks good. I have uploaded it as provided by you.
(Only small "nitpick", please always include the CVE reference in the
changelog as this will ease the work of the security team tracking
the issues).

For uploads to (old-)stable, please see [1]. (btw, the versioning
0.7.2+dfsg1-1+squeeze1 for oldstable, and 0.10.1+dfsg2-1+deb7u1 for
stable looks good).

 [1] <http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/pkgs.html#upload-stable>

Thanks for your work, and regards,
Salvatore

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c0)  Florian Weimer    2013-02-28 16:45:42 UTC  ``` I think it would be a good idea to remove the fallback to the current directory in the weave code (which happens if ~/.python26_compiled is not a writable directory).  This looks unsafe when the current directory is not trusted.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c2)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-03-01 12:19:45 UTC  ``` I'm sorry, but I'm a bit puzzled by this one. You are talking about build_dir, right? Current routine sets it to current dir:      build_dir = configure_build_dir(module_dir)  which is a bug IMO, because argument 'build_dir' is completely ignored -- I'm gonna report it to upstream. But back to the routine that is trying to set build_dir if it's not specified:   1. if build_dir is not writable, it is set to current dir  2. if current dir is not writable either, '/tmp' is used then  So you don't like 1., right?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c3)  Florian Weimer    2013-03-01 12:49:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c2)) > I'm sorry, but I'm a bit puzzled by this one.

I don't like 1.  2 doesn't look great, either, unless a private subdirectory of /tmp is created exactly for this purposes.  I haven't tested the second scenario.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c4)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-03-01 13:45:44 UTC  ``` Okay, I'll fix them both. It is really easy. Brew builds will be done by Monday (March 4th) for sure (if you want to test it).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c5)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-03-04 14:57:29 UTC  ``` Here [1] is a build of scipy with these changes: - Use argument build_dir if it is specified, fallback to module path - Do not fall for current dir if build_dir is not specified - Create temp dir (mkdtemp) when building extension if build_dir is not specified (last fallback)  Tests that test this fall now (I haven't updated them yet).  Is this behaviour okay or should I change it somehow?  [1] <https://brewweb.devel.redhat.com/taskinfo?taskID=5461629>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c6)  Florian Weimer    2013-03-05 16:40:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c5)) > Here [1] is a build of scipy with these changes: > - Use argument build_dir if it is specified, fallback to module path > - Do not fall for current dir if build_dir is not specified > - Create temp dir (mkdtemp) when building extension if build_dir is not > specified (last fallback)  This is good, but I think you have to clean up the directory created with mkdtemp, otherwise it will stick around.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c7)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-03-05 17:14:05 UTC  ``` But what will be the purpose of the execution if the actual result will be deleted? (I think in that case there should be a way to inform the user where is his extension stored)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c8)  Florian Weimer    2013-03-05 17:18:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c7)) > But what will be the purpose of the execution if the actual result will be > deleted? (I think in that case there should be a way to inform the user > where is his extension stored)  If you use os.mkdtemp(), you won't be able to find the directory again, so the data cached there will not be reused.  Perhaps it's best to just error out in this case, simply requiring a writable home directory?  That part is hard to tell for me.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c9)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-03-18 15:26:14 UTC  ``` I found out that it could be traceable, because if 'build_dir' is not on sys.path, build_extension adds it there. But it's not very nice, since /tmp is tmpfs, thus not permanent storage.  Also, answer to comment ( [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=916695#c8](show_bug.cgi?id=916695#c8) ) from #916695 would help me in here.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c10)  Florian Weimer    2013-08-14 14:07:59 UTC  ``` Tomas, I answered your question on [bug 916695](show_bug.cgi?id=916695).  During testing, I noticed this:  [fweimer@localhost ~]$ ls -lhd /tmp/fweimer drwxr-xr-x. 2 nobody nobody 4.0K Aug 14 09:45 /tmp/fweimer [fweimer@localhost ~]$ python Python 2.7.5 (default, Aug  5 2013, 02:37:08)  [GCC 4.8.1 20130717 (Red Hat 4.8.1-5)] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> import random, scipy.weave; a=1; scipy.weave.inline('printf("%%d\\n",a,%f);' % random.random(),['a']) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/weave/inline_tools.py", line 357, in inline     **kw)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/weave/inline_tools.py", line 484, in compile_function     verbose=verbose, **kw)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/weave/ext_tools.py", line 365, in compile     temp = catalog.intermediate_dir()   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/weave/catalog.py", line 220, in intermediate_dir     os.makedirs(path, mode=0o700)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/os.py", line 157, in makedirs     mkdir(name, mode) OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/tmp/fweimer/python27_intermediate' >>>   So this is at least a denial of service.

This is much more severe, not merely hardening, and probably warrants CVE assignment.  This should be fixed in cooperation with upstream, perhaps with a (short) embargo period.  Please do not commit a fix to a public repository or file a public bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c11)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-15 16:16:43 UTC  ``` To summarize, scipy.weave will use /tmp/[username] as persistent storage (cache), but it does not check whether or not this directory already exists, does not check whether it is a directory or a symlink, and also does not verify permissions or ownership, which could allow someone to place code in this directory that would be executed as the user running scipy.weave.  Ideally, it should be creating the directory if it doesn't exist with appropriate ownership/permissions, and if the directory already exists (and permissions/ownership is inappropriate), create a new directory and use it instead (in a similar way that Pulseaudio does, perhaps /var/tmp/scipy-[variable]).   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c12)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-15 16:19:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was found by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c14)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-08-20 13:33:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c11)) > To summarize, scipy.weave will use /tmp/[username] as persistent storage > (cache), but it does not check whether or not this directory already exists  I would like to correct this a little bit. scipy does check whether the dir exists. This is the function that is responsible for creating the directory:   def intermediate_dir():     """ Location in temp dir for storing .cpp and .o  files during         builds.     """     python_name = "python%d%d_intermediate" % tuple(sys.version_info[:2])     path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(),"%s" % whoami(),python_name)     if not os.path.exists(path):         os.makedirs(path, mode=0o700)     return path   As you can see, it checks if the directory already exists.  Currently I'm writing tests for this CVE. When I finish I'll attach them here so it will be pretty easy to fix this. Is this okay?   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c15)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-08-21 13:45:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 788882](attachment.cgi?id=788882 "Unit tests for this CVE") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=788882&action=edit "Unit tests for this CVE") Unit tests for this CVE  I've mocked unit tests for this CVE. These are definitely not final. Especially a part, where the tests play with actual temporary directory (/tmp/<name>/python27...) and not with one created only for purpose of the tests, is really bad. They were created to fit current code only. Also I wanted to know if the tests check correct values.  Once there will be code which fixes this bug, the tests will be easy to adapt.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c16)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-08-23 10:17:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 789545](attachment.cgi?id=789545&action=diff "Patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=789545&action=edit "Patch") Patch   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c17)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-08-23 12:35:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 789580](attachment.cgi?id=789580 "catalog reproducer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=789580&action=edit "catalog reproducer") catalog reproducer  While writing the patch I noticed that same thing occurs for persistent cache/store of compiled functions -- catalog.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c0)  Florian Weimer    2013-02-28 16:45:42 UTC  ``` I think it would be a good idea to remove the fallback to the current directory in the weave code (which happens if ~/.python26_compiled is not a writable directory).  This looks unsafe when the current directory is not trusted.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c2)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-03-01 12:19:45 UTC  ``` I'm sorry, but I'm a bit puzzled by this one. You are talking about build_dir, right? Current routine sets it to current dir:      build_dir = configure_build_dir(module_dir)  which is a bug IMO, because argument 'build_dir' is completely ignored -- I'm gonna report it to upstream. But back to the routine that is trying to set build_dir if it's not specified:   1. if build_dir is not writable, it is set to current dir  2. if current dir is not writable either, '/tmp' is used then  So you don't like 1., right?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c3)  Florian Weimer    2013-03-01 12:49:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c2)) > I'm sorry, but I'm a bit puzzled by this one.

I don't like 1.  2 doesn't look great, either, unless a private subdirectory of /tmp is created exactly for this purposes.  I haven't tested the second scenario.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c4)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-03-01 13:45:44 UTC  ``` Okay, I'll fix them both. It is really easy. Brew builds will be done by Monday (March 4th) for sure (if you want to test it).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c5)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-03-04 14:57:29 UTC  ``` Here [1] is a build of scipy with these changes: - Use argument build_dir if it is specified, fallback to module path - Do not fall for current dir if build_dir is not specified - Create temp dir (mkdtemp) when building extension if build_dir is not specified (last fallback)  Tests that test this fall now (I haven't updated them yet).  Is this behaviour okay or should I change it somehow?  [1] <https://brewweb.devel.redhat.com/taskinfo?taskID=5461629>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c6)  Florian Weimer    2013-03-05 16:40:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c5)) > Here [1] is a build of scipy with these changes: > - Use argument build_dir if it is specified, fallback to module path > - Do not fall for current dir if build_dir is not specified > - Create temp dir (mkdtemp) when building extension if build_dir is not > specified (last fallback)  This is good, but I think you have to clean up the directory created with mkdtemp, otherwise it will stick around.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c7)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-03-05 17:14:05 UTC  ``` But what will be the purpose of the execution if the actual result will be deleted? (I think in that case there should be a way to inform the user where is his extension stored)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c8)  Florian Weimer    2013-03-05 17:18:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c7)) > But what will be the purpose of the execution if the actual result will be > deleted? (I think in that case there should be a way to inform the user > where is his extension stored)  If you use os.mkdtemp(), you won't be able to find the directory again, so the data cached there will not be reused.  Perhaps it's best to just error out in this case, simply requiring a writable home directory?  That part is hard to tell for me.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c9)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-03-18 15:26:14 UTC  ``` I found out that it could be traceable, because if 'build_dir' is not on sys.path, build_extension adds it there. But it's not very nice, since /tmp is tmpfs, thus not permanent storage.  Also, answer to comment ( [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=916695#c8](show_bug.cgi?id=916695#c8) ) from #916695 would help me in here.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c10)  Florian Weimer    2013-08-14 14:07:59 UTC  ``` Tomas, I answered your question on [bug 916695](show_bug.cgi?id=916695).  During testing, I noticed this:  [fweimer@localhost ~]$ ls -lhd /tmp/fweimer drwxr-xr-x. 2 nobody nobody 4.0K Aug 14 09:45 /tmp/fweimer [fweimer@localhost ~]$ python Python 2.7.5 (default, Aug  5 2013, 02:37:08)  [GCC 4.8.1 20130717 (Red Hat 4.8.1-5)] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> import random, scipy.weave; a=1; scipy.weave.inline('printf("%%d\\n",a,%f);' % random.random(),['a']) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/weave/inline_tools.py", line 357, in inline     **kw)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/weave/inline_tools.py", line 484, in compile_function     verbose=verbose, **kw)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/weave/ext_tools.py", line 365, in compile     temp = catalog.intermediate_dir()   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/weave/catalog.py", line 220, in intermediate_dir     os.makedirs(path, mode=0o700)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/os.py", line 157, in makedirs     mkdir(name, mode) OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/tmp/fweimer/python27_intermediate' >>>   So this is at least a denial of service.

This is much more severe, not merely hardening, and probably warrants CVE assignment.  This should be fixed in cooperation with upstream, perhaps with a (short) embargo period.  Please do not commit a fix to a public repository or file a public bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c11)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-15 16:16:43 UTC  ``` To summarize, scipy.weave will use /tmp/[username] as persistent storage (cache), but it does not check whether or not this directory already exists, does not check whether it is a directory or a symlink, and also does not verify permissions or ownership, which could allow someone to place code in this directory that would be executed as the user running scipy.weave.  Ideally, it should be creating the directory if it doesn't exist with appropriate ownership/permissions, and if the directory already exists (and permissions/ownership is inappropriate), create a new directory and use it instead (in a similar way that Pulseaudio does, perhaps /var/tmp/scipy-[variable]).   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c12)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-15 16:19:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was found by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c14)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-08-20 13:33:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c11)) > To summarize, scipy.weave will use /tmp/[username] as persistent storage > (cache), but it does not check whether or not this directory already exists  I would like to correct this a little bit. scipy does check whether the dir exists. This is the function that is responsible for creating the directory:   def intermediate_dir():     """ Location in temp dir for storing .cpp and .o  files during         builds.     """     python_name = "python%d%d_intermediate" % tuple(sys.version_info[:2])     path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(),"%s" % whoami(),python_name)     if not os.path.exists(path):         os.makedirs(path, mode=0o700)     return path   As you can see, it checks if the directory already exists.  Currently I'm writing tests for this CVE. When I finish I'll attach them here so it will be pretty easy to fix this. Is this okay?   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c15)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-08-21 13:45:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 788882](attachment.cgi?id=788882 "Unit tests for this CVE") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=788882&action=edit "Unit tests for this CVE") Unit tests for this CVE  I've mocked unit tests for this CVE. These are definitely not final. Especially a part, where the tests play with actual temporary directory (/tmp/<name>/python27...) and not with one created only for purpose of the tests, is really bad. They were created to fit current code only. Also I wanted to know if the tests check correct values.  Once there will be code which fixes this bug, the tests will be easy to adapt.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c16)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-08-23 10:17:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 789545](attachment.cgi?id=789545&action=diff "Patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=789545&action=edit "Patch") Patch   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c17)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-08-23 12:35:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 789580](attachment.cgi?id=789580 "catalog reproducer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=789580&action=edit "catalog reproducer") catalog reproducer  While writing the patch I noticed that same thing occurs for persistent cache/store of compiled functions -- catalog. We agreed with Florian that it should be fixed too, so I'm going to "respin" the patch.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c18)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-27 01:08:25 UTC  ``` Thanks, Tomas.  Have we reported this upstream or gotten any feedback on it from them yet?   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c19)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-08-27 09:45:05 UTC  ``` As I wrote in the e-mail to your mailing list, I haven't got response yet. This may be because there was an event taking place recently -- EuroSciPy. So I'm assuming they were pretty busy and that's why they didn't respond.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=916690#c20)  Tomas Tomecek    2013-08-27 14:50:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 791020](attachment.cgi?id=791020&action=diff "Patch 2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=791020&action=edit "Patch 2") Patch 2  This patch fixes original issue and similar problem with function 'default_dir'.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=845755#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2013-10-14 11:57:11 UTC  ``` public via rh bugzilla  CVE-2013-4251  weave seems to use things from /tmp and the current directory.  in rh bugzilla:  "I think it would be a good idea to remove the fallback to the current directory in the weave code (which happens if ~/.python26_compiled is not a writable directory).  This looks unsafe when the current directory is not trusted."   SciPy 0.12.1 has been released to fix this issue:  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.12.1/> <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/commit/bd296e0336420b840fcd2faabb97084fd252a973> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-4251> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=916690> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=845755#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2013-10-14 22:00:23 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=845755#c2)  Todd R   2013-11-05 18:18:13 UTC  ``` Version 0.13.0 has been pushed to factory.  If someone wants to update other releases they can do so. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=845755#c3)  Todd R   2014-10-21 10:18:31 UTC  ``` This was fixed with a scipy update a while ago.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-10-14 18:55:14 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  Description  A security issue has been reported in SciPy, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to  potentially gain escalated privileges.  The security issue is caused due to the "scipy.weave" component creating temporary directories in  an insecure manner and can be exploited to e.g. place code that would be executed as the user  running "scipy.weave".  The security issue is reported in versions prior to 0.12.1.   Solution: Update to version 0.12.1.  Provided and/or discovered by: Florian Weimer, Red Hat Product Security Team  Original Advisory: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=916690>   @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please say explicitly if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Justin Lecher (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-10-15 06:49:20 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 487874](show_bug.cgi?id=487874 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - sci-libs/scipy-0.12.0 stable request") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Justin Lecher (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-10-15 06:50:13 UTC  ``` @arches please go ahead. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Pacho Ramos   gentoo-dev  2013-10-20 07:22:11 UTC  ``` amd64 stable (by ago) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-10-22 08:57:57 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-10-24 09:23:35 UTC  ``` ppc64 stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-11-02 09:58:37 UTC  ``` x86 stable.
