    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The `scipy.weave` component in SciPy creates insecure temporary directories.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The component does not properly check if a directory exists before using it as a cache directory.",
        "The component does not verify permissions or ownership of the temporary directory.",
	 "The component falls back to using the current directory, if it does not find or is unable to create the cache directory in the user's home directory or `/tmp`, which can be an untrusted location.",
        "When using `/tmp`, a directory named after the user is used as a persistent cache directory, but it does not verify if it is a symlink or has the proper permissions."
      ],
      "impact": "Local users can trick each other into executing arbitrary code by placing malicious code in the temporary directories used by `scipy.weave`. A denial of service vulnerability exists, when the `/tmp/[username]` directory does not have the proper permissions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A local attacker can create a directory or symlink in `/tmp` with the username of the target user. If the target uses `scipy.weave`, the code placed inside the directory will be executed by the target user.",
	"A local attacker can make the users' home directory not writable, which results in `scipy.weave` falling back to using the current directory, which can be untrusted."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to create directories and files in `/tmp` or have the user's home directory be unwritable, to trigger the vulnerability. This means the attacker needs to share the same machine with the target user.",
