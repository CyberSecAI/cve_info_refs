Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4316:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the default enabling of Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) in Apache Struts 2. DMI allows for method calls to be dynamically determined at runtime based on user-supplied input, which can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The vulnerability stems from DMI being enabled by default. This opens the door for potential misuse if the application isn't explicitly configured to disable it or use it cautiously.
*   **Dynamic Method Invocation:** The DMI mechanism itself is the vulnerability. It allows attackers to potentially invoke arbitrary methods, bypassing intended access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Method Execution:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary methods within the application's context.
*   **Complete Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:**  The provided Oracle document states a CVSS score of 10.0 due to the possibility of complete compromise to the application. This could mean data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or complete denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Exploitation:** The attack vector is over the network, making it remotely exploitable. No authentication is required, exacerbating the risk.
*   **HTTP:** The vulnerability is accessed via HTTP.
*   **User-Supplied Input:** Attackers can leverage user-supplied data within HTTP requests to manipulate which methods are invoked by DMI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without the need for valid credentials.
*   **Understanding of DMI:** The attacker should have knowledge of how to craft HTTP requests that exploit DMI.

**Additional Details from Struts Advisory:**

*   The Struts advisory explicitly states that all Struts 2 versions from 2.0.0 to 2.3.15.1 are affected.
*   The solution provided by Struts is to upgrade to version 2.3.15.2, which disables DMI by default. Alternatively, DMI can be disabled by setting the property `struts.enable.DynamicMethodInvocation` to "false" in `struts.xml`.
*   The Struts advisory emphasizes that upgrading is strongly recommended, and refactoring the application to avoid DMI is preferable.

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-4316 is a critical vulnerability caused by the default configuration of Dynamic Method Invocation in Apache Struts 2, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary methods without authentication. The Oracle advisory notes that this vulnerability also affects Oracle WebCenter Sites and Oracle FLEXCUBE Private Banking. The severity is considered very high due to the potential for complete compromise of affected systems, and Oracle strongly urges users to apply the provided patches.
