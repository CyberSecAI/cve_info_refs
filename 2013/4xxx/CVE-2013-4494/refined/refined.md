```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The locks `page_alloc_lock` and `grant_table.lock` are not always taken in the same order.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
Lock order reversal, leading to a potential deadlock.

Impact of exploitation:
A malicious guest administrator can cause a denial of service to the entire host.

Attack vectors:
A malicious guest with control of more than one vcpu. This can be achieved by either controlling a multi-vcpu guest or controlling multiple guests.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
Local guest administrator with access to multiple vcpus.
