### CVE-2013-4348

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A flaw was found in the way IP packets with an Internet Header Length (ihl) of zero were processed in the `skb_flow_dissect()` function in the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `skb_flow_dissect()` function does not properly validate the `ihl` field of IP packets, leading to a missing check.
- Specifically, it fails to check if the `ihl` is less than 5, which is the minimum value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to trigger an infinite loop in the kernel, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
- The kernel will get stuck in a loop, rendering the system unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker can send specially crafted IP packets with an `ihl` of zero to the target system.
- The attack can be triggered by sending IPIP encapsulated packets with an invalid `ihl`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be remote.
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit ec5efe7946280d1e84603389a1030ccec0a767ae.
- The vulnerability is fixed by adding a check to ensure that the `ihl` is not less than 5.

**Affected Systems:**
- Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4
- openSUSE 12.3
- Ubuntu 12.04 (Saucy HWE), 13.10
- Linux kernel versions prior to the fix
