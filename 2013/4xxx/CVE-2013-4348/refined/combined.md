## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1490)

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way IP packets with an Internet Header Length

(ihl) of zero were processed in the skb\_flow\_dissect() function in the
Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger an infinite
loop in the kernel, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4348,
Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-4387, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the creation of

temporary IPv6 addresses. If the IPv6 privacy extension was enabled
(/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use\_tempaddr set to '2'), an attacker on
the local network could disable IPv6 temporary address generation, leading
to a potential information disclosure. (CVE-2013-0343, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled HID (Human Interface

Device) reports with an out-of-bounds Report ID. An attacker with physical
access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888,
Moderate)

* Heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the

Pantherlord/GreenAsia game controller driver, the Logitech force feedback
drivers, and the Logitech Unifying receivers driver handled HID reports.
An attacker with physical access to the system could use these flaws to
crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-2892, CVE-2013-2893, CVE-2013-2895, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the N-Trig touch

screen driver handled HID reports. An attacker with physical access to the
system could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2013-2896, Moderate)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's device

mapper subsystem, under certain conditions, interpreted data written to
snapshot block devices. An attacker could use this flaw to read data from
disk blocks in free space, which are normally inaccessible. (CVE-2013-4299,
Moderate)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the tun\_set\_iff() function in the

Universal TUN/TAP device driver implementation in the Linux kernel.
A privileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
further escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4343, Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in

the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead
to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected
when ANSI CPRNG was used. (CVE-2013-4345, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 SCTP implementation

interacted with the IPsec subsystem. This resulted in unencrypted SCTP
packets being sent over the network even though IPsec encryption was
enabled. An attacker able to inspect these SCTP packets could use this flaw
to obtain potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-4350, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Fujitsu for reporting CVE-2013-4299 and Stephan
Mueller for reporting CVE-2013-4345. The CVE-2013-4348 issue was discovered
by Jason Wang of Red Hat.

Bug fix:

* RoCE appeared to be supported in the MRG Realtime kernel even when the

required user space packages from the HPN channel were not installed.
The Realtime kernel now checks for the HPN channel packages before exposing
the RoCE interfaces. RoCE devices appear as plain 10GigE devices if the
needed HPN channel user space packages are not installed. (BZ#1012993)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
kernel to version kernel-rt-3.8.13-rt14, and correct these issues.
The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

net: flow\_dissector: fail on evil iph->ihlWe don't validate iph->ihl which may lead a dead loop if we meet a IPIP
skb whose iph->ihl is zero. Fix this by failing immediately when iph->ihl
is evil (less than 5).
This issue were introduced by commit ec5efe7946280d1e84603389a1030ccec0a767ae
(rps: support IPIP encapsulation).

## Details

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Jason Wang discovered a bug in the network flow dissector in the Linux

kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2013-4348](/security/CVE-2013-4348))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for the SystemBase Multi-2/PCI serial card. An unprivileged user

could obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-4516](/security/CVE-2013-4516))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

A race condition flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's ipc shared

memory implimentation. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecied other impacts.

([CVE-2013-7026](/security/CVE-2013-7026))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.11.0-15-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-15.23~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-15.23~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-15-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-15.23~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-15.23~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Details

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Jason Wang discovered a bug in the network flow dissector in the Linux

kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2013-4348](/security/CVE-2013-4348))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for the SystemBase Multi-2/PCI serial card. An unprivileged user

could obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-4516](/security/CVE-2013-4516))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

A race condition flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's ipc shared

memory implimentation. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecied other impacts.

([CVE-2013-7026](/security/CVE-2013-7026))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.11.0-15-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-15.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-15.23)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-15-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-15.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-15.23)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1011927#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-09-25 12:05:55 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the IPv6 protocol(CONFIG_IPV6) support and an Ethernet driver(ex. virtio-net) which has a UDP Fragmentation Offload(UFO) feature ON is vulnerable to inadvertent memory corruptions and NULL pointer dereference  flaw. It could occur while sending a large messages over an IPv6 connection.  Though the crash occurs while sending messages, it could be triggered through a  remote client by requesting larger data from a server.  A remote user user could use this flaw to crash the kernel, resulting in DoS. Despite the random nature of the memory corruptions, potential privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.  Upstream fix: -------------  -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/2811ebac2521ceac84f2bdae402455baa6a7fb47>  Reference: ----------  -> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/09/29/1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1011927#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2013-09-25 12:11:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the version of the kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue affects the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.
