  "CVE-2013-4311": {
    "description": "It was discovered that libvirt used the pkcheck tool in an unsafe manner. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass polkit authentication. In Ubuntu, libvirt polkit authentication is not enabled by default.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "libvirt used the pkcheck command-line tool for policy kit authorization which does not support passing a UID to the function polkit_unix_process_new_full(). This allowed a race condition where the process could change its effective UID and/or UID after starting a setuid or pkexec process, causing polkit to make its authorization check against the wrong UID.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure use of the polkit pkcheck command line tool.",
        "Race condition during privilege checks."
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker could bypass intended PolicyKit authorizations or execute arbitrary commands with root privileges",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the system is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
         "The attacker needs to make a libvirt RPC call and, in another thread, execute a setuid application, causing it to change to effective UID 0."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Local access to the system.",
       "attacker_position": "Local user on the system."

        "patches": [
      "libvirt was rebuilt to communicate with PolicyKit via a different API that is not vulnerable to the race condition. The polkit RHSA-2013:1270 advisory must also be installed to fix the CVE-2013-4311 issue.",
