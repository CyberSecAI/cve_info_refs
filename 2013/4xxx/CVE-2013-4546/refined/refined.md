- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the repository import feature of GitLab where the import URL text field is not properly sanitized, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code on the GitLab server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote code execution. The import URL field allows an attacker to inject malicious code that gets executed on the server during the import process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the GitLab server, potentially gaining full control of the server and its data.
- **Attack vectors:** By specifying a malicious URL in the import URL field when creating a new project.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated GitLab user, capable of creating new projects and specifying a repository to import.
