{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses user-supplied input directly within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server. This includes reading, inserting, deleting database entries, or potentially attacking the underlying operating system depending on the DBMS and its configuration.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the `global.php` file within the `e_meta` function. The `id` parameter, passed through the HTTP request, is directly incorporated into the SQL query.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can inject SQL code through the `id` parameter in the URL."
