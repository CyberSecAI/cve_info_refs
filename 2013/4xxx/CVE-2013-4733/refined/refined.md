The provided content relates to CVE-2013-0137, not CVE-2013-4733. The vulnerability details for CVE-2013-0137 are described below.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the inclusion of a shared private root SSH key within publicly available firmware images of Digital Alert Systems DASDEC and Monroe Electronics One-Net Emergency Alert System (EAS) devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Compromised Root SSH Key (CWE-798, CWE-321):** The firmware images contained a private SSH key authorized to log in with root privileges.
- **Predictable Session ID:** The administrative web server used predictable, monotonically increasing session IDs (though this was disputed by the vendor) (CWE-320).
- **Log Information Disclosure (CWE-532):** Logs available via the web server exposed configuration, operation, and status of the device.
- **Predictable Password Generation (CWE-341):** A script generated passwords in a deterministic manner.
- **Default Passwords:** The devices used default administrative credentials that were not always changed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with the private SSH key could gain root access to a vulnerable device.
- Predictable session IDs could allow an attacker to hijack an existing administrative web session.
- Default passwords could allow an attacker to log in to a device, possibly with root privileges.
- Exposed logs could leak configuration information, assisting an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the device to exploit the compromised SSH key or default passwords.
- **Web Access:** Exploitation of predictable session IDs and log information disclosure require access to the device's web interface.
- **Firmware Access:** The compromised SSH key was included in publicly available firmware images.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  An attacker needs access to either the compromised SSH key and network access to the SSH service, or the default administrative credentials for web access, or both.
- The attacker would ideally need to be on the same network or have a route to the device if it is not exposed to the internet.
-  The attacker would need knowledge of the default passwords, or access to the compromised private SSH key.
