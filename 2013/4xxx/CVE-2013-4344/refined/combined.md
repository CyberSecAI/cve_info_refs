Subject: Xen Security Advisory 65 (CVE-2013-4344) - qemu SCSI REPORT LUNS
 buffer overflow

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-4344 / XSA-65
                              version 2

                 qemu SCSI REPORT LUNS buffer overflow

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

qemu contains a possible buffer overflow in the SCSI code that
implements the REPORT LUNS command.  The buffer can be overflowed by
creating a SCSI controller with more than 256 attached devices (such
as disks) and sending a REPORT LUNS command with a short transfer
buffer (less than 2056 bytes).

Xen systems do not use the qemu SCSI code by default.

IMPACT
======

On Xen systems where the device_model_args (or equivalent) parameters
have been used to configure a SCSI controller for a guest, with more
than 256 devices, a malicious guest might be able to escalate its
privilege to that of the qemu process in the host (typically root).

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only Xen systems whose administrators have deliberately configured HVM
guests to have emulated SCSI controllers, and where those guests are
provided with more than 256 devices, are vulnerable.

We are not aware of any such systems.

MITIGATION AND RESOLUTION
=========================

Please refer to the advisories and information from the Qemu project.

If, during the embargo period, you have any questions about this
advisory in the context of Xen, please contact the Xen Project
Security Team.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was reported to us by the Qemu project.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1007330#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-09-12 09:46:43 UTC  ``` A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way qemu processed SCSI REPORT LUNS command when excessive LUNS were defined for a single SCSI target.  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt qemu process memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the qemu process.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Asias He of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1007330#c2)  Petr Matousek    2013-09-12 09:54:39 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the kvm and xen packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue does affect the qemu-kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Future qemu-kvm updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1007330#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-10-02 22:16:11 UTC  ``` This is now public:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/10/02/2>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1007330#c4)  Petr Matousek    2013-10-03 19:01:35 UTC  ```  Created xen tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1015275](show_bug.cgi?id=1015275 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-4344 xen: qemu: buffer overflow in scsi_target_emulate_report_luns [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1007330#c5)  Petr Matousek    2013-10-03 19:01:53 UTC  ```  Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1015274](show_bug.cgi?id=1015274 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4344 qemu: buffer overflow in scsi_target_emulate_report_luns [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1007330#c6)  Fedora Update System    2013-10-14 07:05:50 UTC  ``` qemu-1.4.2-12.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**".

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1007224#c0)  Asias He    2013-09-12 07:16:19 UTC  ``` Description of problem:          In 4146b46c42e0989cb5842e04d88ab6ccb1713a48 (block: Produce zeros when         protocols reading beyond end of file), we break qemu-iotests ./check         -qcow2 022. This happens because qcow2 temporarily sets ->growable = 1         for vmstate accesses (which are stored beyond the end of regular image         data).              We introduce the bs->zero_beyond_eof to allow qcow2_load_vmstate() to         disable ->zero_beyond_eof temporarily in addition to enable ->growable.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible:   100%  Steps to Reproduce:  Run the qemu-iotests ./check -qcow2 022 test  Actual results:  qemu-iotest does not pass  Expected results:  qemu-iotest should pass  Additional info:  The fix is in upstream now. I will backport to rhel shortly.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1007224#c2)  Qunfang Zhang    2013-09-13 07:07:56 UTC  ``` Confirmed with Asias, this bug could also be reproduce by 'savevm'/'loadvm'.

# USN-2092-1: QEMU vulnerabilities

30 January 2014

Several security issues were fixed in QEMU.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [qemu](/security/cves?package=qemu) - Machine emulator and virtualizer
* [qemu-kvm](/security/cves?package=qemu-kvm) - Machine emulator and virtualizer

## Details

Asias He discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled SCSI controllers with

more than 256 attached devices. A local user could possibly use this flaw

to elevate privileges. ([CVE-2013-4344](/security/CVE-2013-4344))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled Xen disks. A local guest

could possibly use this flaw to consume resources, resulting in a denial of

service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu 13.10.

([CVE-2013-4375](/security/CVE-2013-4375))

Sibiao Luo discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled device hot-unplugging.

A local user could possibly use this flaw to cause a denial of service.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2013-4377](/security/CVE-2013-4377))

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Topic

Updated qemu-kvm-rhev, qemu-kvm-rhev-tools, and qemu-img-rhev packages are
now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM, in
environments managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU processed the SCSI "REPORT
LUNS" command when more than 256 LUNs were specified for a single SCSI
target. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process
memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code
execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
(CVE-2013-4344)

This issue was discovered by Asias He of Red Hat.

This update fixes the following bugs:

* In QMP monitor, if an attempt was made to create an image with the same

file name as the backing file, an error was generated, but no message was
displayed. Performing this action in QMP Monitor now generates the same
error message as performing the action in HMP: "Error: Trying to create an
image with the same file name as the backing file". (BZ#877240)

* QEMU I/O throttling has been disabled in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is

now only available enabled in the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization QEMU
package (qemu-kvm-rhev). (BZ#975468)

* When booting a guest machine, it would still boot when specifying iops

and bps as a negative value, without displaying an error message. This has
been fixed so that if a negative value is used the guest does not boot and
QEMU exits with the following message 'bps and iops values must be 0 or
greater'. (BZ#987725)

* When booting a guest with QMP server, hot plug was failing. It can now do

hotplug with QEMU I/O throttling including iops, iops\_wr, iops\_rd, bps,
bps\_wr, bps\_rd inofs successfully. (BZ#987745)

* Due to a change in virtualization features, all fixes and errata related

to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization specific features, can only be posted
to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization channel. Therefore a Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization specific qemu-kvm (for RHEV-H-6.5.0 Errata) was
developed. This meant that the qemu-kvm-rhev binary was mapped to a Red Had
enterprise Virtualization channel, entitled to Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization customers, and disabled from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
channel. (BZ#997032)

* The qemu-kvm-rhev package now contains /usr/lib64/qemu, as this directory

is where CEPH packages provide librbd to be used by QEMU at runtime.
(BZ#999705)

* QEMU performed a core dump when iops.bps was set to a negative value.

This has been fixed so that it no longer performs a core dump when a
negative value is entered, instead an error message is displayed indicating
the values must be zero of greater. (BZ#1001436)

* When running the "rpm -V qemu-kvm-rhev" command, an error was generated

stating there were unsatisfied dependencies. This has been fixed so there
now are no unsatisfied dependencies and it executes correctly. (BZ#1010930)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

* QEMU I/O throttling allows for finer control of the rate of I/O

operations at the QEMU level, and is therefore independent of the
underlying storage device. A similar feature can be created by using
cgroups at the libvirt level, but cgroups is limited as it does not support
some storage devices (such as image files over NFS) and throttles the whole
virtual machine, including access to meta-data, while qemu I/O is more
fine-grained. (BZ#956825)

* Patches were added to the QEMU block driver for accessing CEPH storage on

qemu-kvm-rhev. However,this is not usable on its own, a librbd library
still needs to be provided. The librbd library is not provided in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and will be handled by a third party source. (BZ#988079)

## Solution

All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization users with deployed virtualization
hosts are advised to install these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues and add these enhancements.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

## Binary packages built by this source

[kvm](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/kvm):
dummy transitional package from kvm to qemu-kvm

This transitional package helps users transition from the kvm package to the

 qemu-kvm package. Once this package and its dependencies are installed you

 can safely remove it.

[qemu](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/qemu):
dummy transitional package from qemu to qemu-kvm

This transitional package helps users transition from the qemu package to the

 qemu-kvm package. Once this package and its dependencies are installed you

 can safely remove it.

[qemu-common](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/qemu-common):
qemu common functionality (bios, documentation, etc)

This package pulls in the various binary bios rom blobs needed to boot

 the various emulated architectures, as well as the documentation.

[qemu-kvm](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/qemu-kvm):
Full virtualization on i386 and amd64 hardware

Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual PCs, each running unmodified Linux or

 Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a

 network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.

 .

 KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for

 Linux hosts on x86 (32 and 64-bit) hardware.

 .

 KVM is intended for systems where the processor has hardware support for

 virtualization, see below for details. All combinations of 32-bit and 64-bit

 host and guest systems are supported, except 64-bit guests on 32-bit hosts.

 .

 KVM requires your system to support hardware virtualization, provided by AMD's

 SVM capability or Intel's VT. To find out if your processor has the necessary

 support:

 .

   egrep "flags.\*:.\*(svm|vmx)" /proc/cpuinfo

 .

 If it prints anything, the processor provides hardware virtualization

 support and is suitable for use with KVM. Without hardware support, you can

 use qemu emulation instead.

 .

 KVM consists of two loadable kernel modules (kvm.ko and either kvm-amd.ko or

 kvm-intel.ko) and a userspace component. This package contains the userspace

 component, and you can get the kernel modules from the standard kernel images.

 .

 This package contains support for running virtualized and emulated x86 and

 x86-64 machines only. Support for other architectures is provided by the

 qemu-linaro source package.

[qemu-utils](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/qemu-utils):
qemu utilities

This package provides some utilities for which full qemu-kvm is not needed,

 in particular qemu-nbd and qemu-img.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1553)

## Topic

Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems that is built into the standard Red Hat
Enterprise Linux kernel. The qemu-kvm packages form the user-space
component for running virtual machines using KVM.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU processed the SCSI "REPORT
LUNS" command when more than 256 LUNs were specified for a single SCSI
target. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process
memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code
execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
(CVE-2013-4344)

This issue was discovered by Asias He of Red Hat.

These updated qemu-kvm packages include numerous bug fixes and various
enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Technical
Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
of these changes.

All qemu-kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements. After installing this update, shut down all running virtual
machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for
this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>
