Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4237:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `readdir_r` function within the GNU C Library (glibc). This function, used for reading directory entries, did not properly enforce the `NAME_MAX` limit when handling filenames. Specifically, if a filesystem (like NTFS or CIFS) returned filenames longer than `NAME_MAX` the `readdir_r` function would write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow vulnerability in `readdir_r` due to the lack of proper length checking on filenames. The function would attempt to write directory entries with filenames exceeding the buffer size into a fixed-size buffer, leading to a write out-of-bounds condition.
*   **Missing NUL-termination:** In some architectures, the name was clipped without ensuring NUL-termination, which might create additional issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The most common impact was a crash of the application using `readdir_r` due to the buffer overflow.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):**  In a best case for the attacker,  the overflow could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** By providing a specially crafted NTFS or CIFS filesystem, an attacker could trigger the buffer overflow when an application attempts to read directory entries from it using the flawed function.
*   **Remote Attack:** For filesystems like CIFS the attack is not limited to local exploitation but can be performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to control, modify, or create a malicious filesystem that contains directory entries with filenames exceeding `NAME_MAX` in length.
*   The attacker requires an application that uses the vulnerable `readdir_r` function.
* The attacker needs to make the application attempt to read the crafted filesystem.

**Additional Technical Details (from sourceware.org):**
*   The bug was present in `sysdeps/posix/readdir_r.c` implementation of `readdir_r`.
*   The fix involved adding a length check to enforce the `NAME_MAX` limit, similar to existing checks in functions like `realpath` and `getwd`.
*   The fix also included handling errors correctly (returning `ENAMETOOLONG`) and ensuring proper NUL-termination of filenames after clipping.
* The fix includes adding an `errcode` member to `struct __dirstream` which is used to return delayed error codes.
* The `GETDENTS_64BIT_ALIGNED` conditional was removed from the affected code.
* Documentation updates were made to reflect the `ENAMETOOLONG` return value of `readdir_r` and a recommendation to use `readdir` instead.
* A test case `tst-readdir-long` was added.

**Mitigation (from Red Hat):**
* Do not open untrusted filesystem image files on production systems.

**Affected Software (from Ubuntu):**
* eglibc (GNU C Library)

**Resolution:**
*   Upgrade glibc to version 2.19-r1 (or higher)
* Ubuntu systems should update to the specific versions listed in the Ubuntu Security Notice.
