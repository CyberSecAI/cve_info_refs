{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient or missing error handling in routines that handle guest memory reads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The hypervisor does not properly handle errors when reading guest memory during certain guest-initiated operations, such as port or memory-mapped I/O writes."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious HVM guest can read sensitive data from the hypervisor stack, potentially revealing information about other guests or the hypervisor itself.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious HVM guest crafts specific I/O operations (e.g., port or memory mapped I/O writes) involving addresses without associated memory."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a malicious HVM guest. They need to be able to trigger I/O operations within that guest to exploit the vulnerability."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Xen 3.2.x and later (unspecified if 3.1.x and earlier are vulnerable)",
     "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP3 LTSS",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4 LTSS",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 LTSS",
      "openSUSE 12.2",
     "Debian (wheezy)",
     "Gentoo (all architectures, < 4.3.2-r4)"
  ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability specifically affects HVM guests, and PV guests are not vulnerable. The issue was found by Coverity Scan and diagnosed by Andrew Cooper & Tim Deegan."
