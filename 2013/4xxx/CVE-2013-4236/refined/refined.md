Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4236:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The initial fix for CVE-2013-0167 was incomplete. This allowed a privileged guest user to potentially disrupt the communication between the virtualization host and the management server. The vulnerability arises from the way guest agent data, specifically when it includes invalid XML characters, is processed by the host.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incomplete input sanitization or validation of data received from guest agents. Specifically, the vdsm component failed to properly handle invalid XML characters in the data returned by guest agents.
- The system was vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack via a specially crafted response from a guest agent.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A privileged guest user could make the virtualization host unavailable to the management server. This could disrupt the management of the virtualized environment.

**Attack vectors:**
- A privileged user within a virtual machine could manipulate the guest agent to send responses containing invalid XML characters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have privileged access within a guest virtual machine running on a vulnerable virtualization host.

**Additional details:**
- This CVE is a follow-up to CVE-2013-0167, indicating a patch bypass or incomplete fix.
- The vulnerability was found by David Gibson of Red Hat.
- The fix involves sanitizing or validating the XML data received from guest agents.
- The issue affects Red Hat Virtualization 3.2 and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.
- Patches were released through RHSA-2013:1155 and RHSA-2013:1181.
