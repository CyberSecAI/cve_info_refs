{
  "cve": "CVE-2013-4278",
  "description": "The 'create an instance' API in OpenStack Compute (Nova) did not properly check the 'is_public' attribute of a flavor, allowing users to create instances using flavors that were not intended to be public.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The servers API in OpenStack Compute (Nova) was not passing the context when retrieving flavor details, causing it to use an admin context instead of the user's, thus bypassing the intended access controls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control checks in the 'create an instance' API.",
      "Incorrect context usage when retrieving flavor details."
    ],
    "impact": "A non-admin user could circumvent resource limits by accessing private flavors, potentially leading to unauthorized resource consumption or service disruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker would need valid credentials for an OpenStack tenant.",
      "The attacker needs to know the ID of a non-public flavor."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be a valid OpenStack user, but not necessarily an administrator, and would need to be able to make API requests directly, or through a vulnerable tool."
