Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4795:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of HTML within user's full names. Specifically, when a user's full name, containing HTML, was displayed in the "Submitters list", it was rendered without proper escaping, leading to the potential injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious HTML embedded within a user's name is rendered on the page, allowing for the execution of arbitrary scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript, which could lead to various consequences, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the Review Board interface
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - potentially accessing sensitive data

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the user profile's full name field. An attacker could craft a malicious name containing HTML and, upon display, trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the Review Board system and the ability to modify their full name field.
- No elevated privileges are required, as the vulnerability is triggered by a standard user action.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Review Board version 1.6.18 and 1.7.12
- The fix involved escaping HTML characters when rendering user's full names in the submitter's list
