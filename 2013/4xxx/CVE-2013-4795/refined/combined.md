# Review Board 1.7.12 Release Notes[¶](#review-board-1-7-12-release-notes "Permalink to this heading")

**Release date**: July 28, 2013

## Security Fixes[¶](#security-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

This release contains security updates to better lock down Review Board
from malicious users.

There are no known vulnerabilities in the wild for these issues, but we
recommend upgrading immediately.

* Function names in diff headers are no longer rendered as HTML.
  Patch by Damian Johnson. ([Bug #2612](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/2612))
* If a user’s full name contained HTML, the Submitters list would render
  it as HTML, without escaping it. This was an XSS vulnerability.
  ([CVE-2013-4795](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4795))
* The default Apache configuration is now more strict with how it serves
  up file attachments. This does not apply to older installations.
  To update your configuration, and to read best practices, read our
  guide on [securing file attachments](http://support.beanbaginc.com/support/solutions/articles/110173-securing-file-attachments).
* Uploaded files are now renamed to include a hash, preventing users from
  uploading malicious filenames, and making filenames unguessable.
* Recaptcha support has been updated to use the new URLs provided by Google.
  This re-enables Recaptcha support when serving over HTTPS.

## New Features[¶](#new-features "Permalink to this heading")

* Added a `X-ReviewRequest-Repository` header for e-mails. This will
  list the name of the repository. Patch by Dan Tehranian.

## Extension Improvements[¶](#extension-improvements "Permalink to this heading")

* Extensions can now specify their list of app directories.

  An Extension subclass can define an `apps` member variable that,
  like `INSTALLED_APPS`, lists the app module paths the extension
  uses. These will each be added to `INSTALLED_APPS` when enabled,
  and removed when disabled.

  If an extension does not provide `apps`, then this falls back
  on the default behavior of only adding the extension’s parent
  app.
* Extensions can now specify the author’s URL.

  Extension.metadata can now specify an `Author-home-page` field,
  which points to the URL for the author’s site. This is meant to
  distinguish between the extension’s URL, and the URL for the
  person/company/organization that created the extension.
* Improved the look and feel for extension configuration.

  The extension configuration pages now fit in with the admin UI
  a lot better. They share much of the look of other admin UI
  pages.

  Furthermore, when extensions are saved, there’s now feedback
  given to the user, instead of just simply re-rendering the page.
* Improved the functionality for extension configuration.

  Extension configuration forms now contain all the functionality
  of `SiteSettingsForm`. This include fieldsets and save blacklists
  (which prevent a field from automatically being saved in the
  extension settings).
* Improved the list of available extensions.

  The list no longer causes part of the extension description
  to be overlapped. It also shows the author of the extension,
  and links back to the author’s site.

## Bug Fixes[¶](#bug-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed the “Show Whitespace Changes” toggle. ([Bug #2941](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/2941))
* Fixed compatibility with modern versions of django-storages.
  Patch by Victoria Ponce.
* Draft comments on file attachments are no longer shown to all users.
* Fixed issues with console windows appearing when invoking Clear Case
  requests on Python 2.7.x and Windows 7. Patch by Nicolas Dély.
* Review requests on Local Sites are now guaranteed to have the proper
  ID. Previously, this would fail in some circumstances.
* Fixed starring review requests on Local Sites.

```
What version are you running?
1.6.6

What's the URL of the page containing the problem?
I discarded the review and do not have the link

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Modify a file and move code all around the place.
2. Upload the diff on review board
3. It seems stuck doing something

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see the diff, I instead see that review board is busy with something.
I recently noticed this feature of reviewboard, that tells us if lines of code were moved around in the file. I changed a file, where I had to move around a lot of code. Maybe the logic is stuck trying to figure out all the lines moved?

What operating system are you using? What browser?
Windows 7, chrome

Please provide any additional information below.

So the entry for the diff is just showing a spinner and never doing anything? Can you go into your browser's JavaScript console and see if there are any errors?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research).

# ReviewBoard Vulnerabilities

---

*From*: Craig Young <vuln-report () secur3 us>

*Date*: Thu, 8 Aug 2013 23:53:46 -0400

```
ReviewBoard (www.reviewboard.org) aims to 'take the pain out of code
review'. Integration with source control makes it imperative to
maintain proper protections on this server.  I have worked with the
developers to resolve multiple XSS conditions and harden web server
configurations.  The XSS conditions are resolved by upgrading to the
latest release but the arguably more important fix (configuration
change) must be manually applied to existing sites.

ReviewBoard admins are advised to upgrade and review your Apache/nginx
configurations to avoid access control bypass, code execution, and
xss.  I have prepared a blog post to explain the issues and provide
proof-of-concept/reproduction information:

Thanks,

# Review Board 1.6.18 Release Notes[¶](#review-board-1-6-18-release-notes "Permalink to this heading")

**Release date**: July 28, 2013

## Security Fixes[¶](#security-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

This release contains security updates to better lock down Review Board
from malicious users.

There are no known vulnerabilities in the wild for these issues, but we
recommend upgrading immediately.

* Function names in diff headers are no longer rendered as HTML.
  Patch by Damian Johnson. ([Bug #2612](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/2612))
* If the user’s full name contained HTML, the Submitters list would render
  it as HTML, without escaping it. This was an XSS vulnerability.
  ([CVE-2013-4795](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4795))
* The default Apache configuration is now more strict with how it serves
  up file attachments. This does not apply to older installations.
  To update your configuration, and to read best practices, read our
  guide on [securing file attachments](http://support.beanbaginc.com/support/solutions/articles/110173-securing-file-attachments).
* Uploaded files are now renamed to include a hash, preventing users from
  uploading malicious filenames, and making filenames unguessable.
* Recaptcha support has been updated to use the new URLs provided by Google.
  This re-enables Recaptcha support when serving over HTTPS.
