Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4161:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an improper patch application for CVE-2012-5617 in `gksu-polkit`. The intended fix was not correctly implemented, leaving the system vulnerable to the original issue. Specifically, the patch introduced in `gksu-polkit-0.0.3-6.fc18` (and other versions) did not actually correct the underlying authentication issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Patching:** The core weakness is the incorrect application of a security patch. This resulted in a situation where a system was believed to be secured against a known vulnerability (CVE-2012-5617) but was not.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The underlying flaw (from CVE-2012-5617) is a privilege escalation vulnerability. It allows a local user with low privileges to potentially gain elevated permissions due to flaws in policykit configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain higher privileges on the affected system. This could allow the attacker to gain full control over the system, read sensitive data, install malware, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have user-level access on the vulnerable machine to trigger the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a user account with low privileges on the target system.
*   **Knowledge of the Exploit:** The attacker would need knowledge of how to trigger the privilege escalation vulnerability within `gksu-polkit`.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability primarily affects `gksu-polkit` packages as distributed in Fedora and possibly other distributions that inherited the flawed patch.
*   **Specific Versions:**  `gksu-polkit-0.0.3-6.fc18` is mentioned as one of the versions where the improper patching occurred.
*  **Ubuntu Status:** Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is listed as not affected by this issue, while Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 15.04 are listed as "Not in release".
*   **Red Hat Bugzilla:** Red Hat tracks this vulnerability as bug #987561, confirming the issue was due to the improper patching.

In summary, CVE-2013-4161 is a critical security vulnerability caused by an improper patch application that left systems exposed to a privilege escalation flaw. An attacker with local access could gain full system control.
