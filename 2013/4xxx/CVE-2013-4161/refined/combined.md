### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=987561#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-07-23 16:21:39 UTC  ``` It was found that the patch to correct [CVE-2012-5617](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5617) ([bug #883162](show_bug.cgi?id=883162 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-5617 gksu-polkit: privilege escalation due to improper authentication settings in policykit configuration file")) was improperly applied, so the vulnerability described by [CVE-2012-5617](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5617) was never really fixed.  As a result, gksu-polkit-0.0.3-6.fc18 was reported as fixing the issue, however it did not.  Similarly, the version in Fedora 19 is still vulnerable to this flaw.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=987561#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-07-23 16:23:09 UTC  ```  Created gksu-polkit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 987562](show_bug.cgi?id=987562 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4161 gksu-polkit: improper patching of CVE-2012-5617 leaves gksu-polkit still vulnerable [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=987561#c2)  Fedora Update System    2013-08-04 00:02:11 UTC  ``` gksu-polkit-0.0.3-8.gitf8ce834c.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=987561#c3)  Fedora Update System    2013-08-04 00:07:53 UTC  ``` gksu-polkit-0.0.3-8.gitf8ce834c.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
