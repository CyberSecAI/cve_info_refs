# USN-2111-1: Linux kernel (Quantal HWE) vulnerabilities

18 February 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine

(KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a

device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2013-4592](/security/CVE-2013-4592))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-46-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-46.70~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-46.70~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](/security/CVE-2013-4470))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine

(KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a

device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2013-4592](/security/CVE-2013-4592))

Catalin Marinas reported a flaw in the get\_user and put\_user API functions

in the Linux kernel on ARM platforms. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrator privileges. ([CVE-2013-6282](/security/CVE-2013-6282))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1442-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1442.61](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1442.61)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1031702#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-11-18 15:10:11 UTC  ``` When a user memory slot is moved (ie. the base_gfn changes), iommu pages are neither unpinned nor unmapped.  The memory for these pages then cannot be recovered without rebooting the system.  Local user with ability to assign device (with access to PCI sysfs files for a device) could use this flaw to DoS the system.

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine

(KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a

device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2013-4592](/security/CVE-2013-4592))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-238-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-238.54](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-238.54)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](/security/CVE-2013-4470))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

Subject: CVE-2013-4592 -- Linux kernel: kvm: memory leak when memory slot is
 moved with assigned device

When a user memory slot is moved (ie. the base_gfn changes), iommu pages
are neither unpinned nor unmapped.  The memory for these pages then
cannot be recovered without rebooting the system.

Local user with ability to assign device (with access to PCI sysfs files
for a device) could use this flaw to DoS the system.

the ongoing support and maintenance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.
This is the fifth regular update.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-4387, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the creation of

temporary IPv6 addresses. If the IPv6 privacy extension was enabled
(/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use\_tempaddr set to '2'), an attacker on the
local network could disable IPv6 temporary address generation, leading to a
potential information disclosure. (CVE-2013-0343, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled HID (Human Interface

Device) reports with an out-of-bounds Report ID. An attacker with physical
access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888,
Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in

the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead
to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected
when ANSI CPRNG was used. (CVE-2013-4345, Moderate)

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-2375 released via RHSA-2012:1580

accidentally removed a check for small-sized result buffers. A local,
unprivileged user with access to an NFSv4 mount with ACL support could use
this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
the system . (CVE-2013-4591, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way IOMMU memory mappings were handled when

moving memory slots. A malicious user on a KVM host who has the ability to
assign a device to a guest could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2013-4592, Moderate)

* Heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the Zeroplus and

Pantherlord/GreenAsia game controllers handled HID reports. An attacker
with physical access to the system could use these flaws to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-2889, CVE-2013-2892, Moderate)

* Two information leak flaws were found in the logical link control (LLC)

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use
these flaws to leak kernel stack memory to user space. (CVE-2012-6542,
CVE-2013-3231, Low)

* A heap-based buffer overflow in the way the tg3 Ethernet driver parsed

the vital product data (VPD) of devices could allow an attacker with
physical access to a system to cause a denial of service or, potentially,
escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1929, Low)

* Information leak flaws in the Linux kernel could allow a privileged,

local user to leak kernel memory to user space. (CVE-2012-6545,
CVE-2013-1928, CVE-2013-2164, CVE-2013-2234, Low)

* A format string flaw was found in the Linux kernel's block layer.

A privileged, local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their
privileges to kernel level (ring0). (CVE-2013-2851, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Stephan Mueller for reporting CVE-2013-4345,
and Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2013-2851.

This update also fixes several hundred bugs and adds enhancements. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Release Notes for information on the most
significant of these changes, and the Technical Notes for further
information, both linked to in the References.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 users are advised to install these updated
packages, which correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Release Notes and
Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

# USN-2114-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

18 February 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine

(KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a

device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2013-4592](/security/CVE-2013-4592))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-46-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-46.70](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-46.70)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-46-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-46.70](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-46.70)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-46-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-46.70](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-46.70)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-46-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-46.70](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-46.70)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-46-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-46.70](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-46.70)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-2112-1: Linux kernel (Raring HWE) vulnerabilities

18 February 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-raring](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-raring) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Raring

## Details

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Jason Wang discovered a bug in the network flow dissector in the Linux

kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2013-4348](/security/CVE-2013-4348))

A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine

(KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a

device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2013-4592](/security/CVE-2013-4592))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-36-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-36.52~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-36.52~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

KVM: Fix iommu map/unmap to handle memory slot moves

```
The iommu integration into memory slots expects memory slots to be
added or removed and doesn't handle the move case.  We can unmap
slots from the iommu after we mark them invalid and map them before
installing the final memslot array.  Also re-order the kmemdup vs
map so we don't leave iommu mappings if we get ENOMEM.
