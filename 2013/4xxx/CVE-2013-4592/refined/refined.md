{
  "CVE-2013-4592": {
    "description": "A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine (KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).",
    "root_cause": "When a user memory slot is moved (i.e., the base_gfn changes) in the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem, IOMMU pages are neither unpinned nor unmapped. The memory for these pages then cannot be recovered without rebooting the system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of IOMMU mappings during memory slot moves",
      "Lack of unpinning and unmapping of IOMMU pages"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with the ability to assign a device can cause a denial of service by exhausting memory resources, leading to system instability. Memory leak can result in a DoS.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system",
      "Ability to assign a device (with access to PCI sysfs files for a device) to a KVM guest"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
       "Local user",
      "Ability to assign a device to a KVM guest",
       "Access to PCI sysfs files for a device"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem and affects systems where IOMMU is used. Fixes involve ensuring that IOMMU pages are properly unmapped/unpinned when memory slots are moved. Upstream fixes were backported by various distros, including Red Hat and Ubuntu, see for example the commits at <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=12d6e7538e2d418c08f082b1b44ffa5fb7270ed8> and <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e40f193f5bb022e927a57a4f5d5194e4f12ddb74>."
