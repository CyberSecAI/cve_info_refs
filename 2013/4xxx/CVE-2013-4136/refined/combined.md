# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Moderate: rubygem-passenger security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1136)

## Topic

Updated rubygem-passenger packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.2.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

rubygem-passenger is a web server for Ruby, Python and Node.js
applications.

The rubygem-passenger gem created and re-used temporary directories and
files in an insecure fashion. A local attacker could use these flaws to
conduct a denial of service attack, take over the operation of the
application or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running rubygem-passenger. (CVE-2013-2119, CVE-2013-4136)

Note: By default, OpenShift Enterprise uses polyinstantiation (per user)
for the /tmp/ directory, thereby minimizing the risk and impact of
exploitation by local attackers of both CVE-2013-2119 and CVE-2013-4136.

The CVE-2013-2119 issue was discovered by Michael Scherer of the Red Hat
Regional IT team.

The following packages are included with this update as dependencies of the
updated Ruby 1.8 passenger packages:

rubygem-spruz-0.2.5-4.el6op
rubygem-file-tail-1.0.5-4.el6op

Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.2 are advised to upgrade to
these updated packages, which correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, manual action is required before the update takes effect.
Refer to the Solution section for details.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

Manual action is required for this update to take effect. In order for the
updated passenger packages to be loaded by Ruby applications in the PaaS,
the applications must be restarted with oo-admin-ctl-gears. One way to
accomplish this is by running the following command, as a single line
without the line break, on all OpenShift Nodes:

for rubyapp in `ls -d /var/lib/openshift/\*/ruby |
cut -f5 -d/`; do oo-admin-ctl-gears restartgear $rubyapp; done

If there are no Ruby applications on a Node it will simply fail with the
message "No such file or directory". Another option is to run the
following on all OpenShift Nodes; however, it will result in non-Ruby
applications also being restarted:

oo-admin-ctl-gears restartall

(Note that without the manual action, if a user attempts to restart their
Ruby application via the rhc command line, it will fail to start with a
"Passenger could not be initialized..." error.)

 \* Fixed a potential 100% CPU lock up in the crash handler, which only occurs on OS X. Fixes issue #908. \* Fixed a crash in request handling, when certain events are trigger after the client has already disconnected. Fixes issue #889. \* Phusion Passenger will no longer crash when the Phusion Passenger native\_support Ruby extension cannot be compiled, e.g. because the Ruby development headers are not installed or because the current user has no permission to save the native extension file. Fixes issue #890. \* Fixed OS X 10.9 support. Fixes issue #906. \* Removed dependency on bash, so that Phusion Passenger works out of the box on BSD platforms without installing/configuring bash. Fixes issue #911. \* Fix 'PassengerPoolIdleTime 0' not being respected correctly. Issue #904. \* Admin tools improvement: it is now possible to see all currently running requests by invoking `passenger-status --show=requests`. \* [Apache] Fixed compatibility with Apache pipe logging. Previously this would cause Phusion Passenger to lock up with 100% CPU during Apache restart. \* [Nginx] The Nginx configure script now checks whether 'ruby' is in $PATH. Previously, if 'ruby' is not in $PATH, then the compilation process fails with an obscure error. \* [Nginx] passenger-install-nginx-module now works properly even when Phusion Passenger is installed through the Debian packages. Before, the installer would tell you to install Phusion Passenger through the gem or tarball instead. \* [Enterprise] Added pretty printing helpers to the Live IRB Console. \* Fixed permissions on a subdirectory in the server instance directory. The server instance directory is a temporary directory that Phusion Passenger uses to store working files, and is deleted after Phusion Passenger exits. A subdirectory inside it is world-writable (but not world-readable) and is used for storing Unix domain sockets created by different apps, which may run as different users. These sockets had long random filenames to prevent them from being guessed. However because of a typo, this subdirectory was created with the setuid bit, when it should have sticky bit (to prevent existing files from being deleted or renamed by a user that doesn't own the file). This has now been fixed. \* If the server instance directory already exists, it will now be removed first in order get correct directory permissions. If the directory still exists after removal, Phusion Passenger aborts to avoid writing to a directory with unexpected permissions. Fixes issue #910. \* The installer now checks whether the system has enough virtual memory, and prints a helpful warning if it doesn't. \* Linux/AArch64 compatibility fixes. Patch contributed by Dirk Mueller. \* Improved documentation.
Release 4.0.5-------------
 \* [Standalone] Fixed a regression that prevented Passenger Standalone from starting. Fixes issue #899. \* Fixed security vulnerability CVE-2013-2119.
 Urgency: low Scope: local exploit Summary: denial of service and arbitrary code execution by hijacking temp files Affected versions: all versions Fixed versions: 3.0.21 and 4.0.5
 Description: Phusion Passenger's code did not always create temporary files and directories in a secure manner. Temporary files and directories were sometimes created with a predictable filename. A local attacker can pre-create temporary files, resulting in a denial of service. In addition, this vulnerability allows a local attacker to run arbitrary code as another user, by hijacking temporary files.
 By pre-creating certain temporary files with certain permissions, attackers can prevent Passenger Standalone from starting (denial of service).
 By pre-creating certain temporary files with certain other permissions, attackers can trick `passenger start` and the build system (which is invoked by `passenger-install-apache2-module`/`passenger-install-nginx-module`) to run arbitrary code. The user that the code is run as, is equal to the user that ran `passenger start` or the build system. Attacks of this nature have to be timed exactly right. The attacker must overwrite the file contents right after Phusion Passenger has created the file contents, but right before the file is used. In the context of `passenger start`, the vulnerable window begins right after Passenger Standalone has created the Nginx config file, and ends when Nginx has read the config file. Once Nginx has started and initialized, the system is no longer vulnerable. `passenger stop` and other Passenger Standalone commands besides `start` are not vulnerable. In the context of the build system, the vulnerable window begins when `passenger-install-apache2-module`/`passenger-install-nginx-module` prints its first dependency checking message, and ends when it prints the first compiler command.
 Only the `passenger start` command, the `passenger-install-apache2-module` command and the `passenger-install-nginx-module` commands are vulnerable. Phusion Passenger for Apache and Phusion Passenger for Nginx (once they are installed) are not vulnerable.
 Fixed versions: 3.0.21 and 4.0.5 have been released to address this issue.
 Workaround: You can use this workaround if you are unable to upgrade. Before invoking any Phusion Passenger command, set the `TMPDIR` environment variable to a directory that is not world-writable. Special care must be taken when you use sudo: sudo resets all environment variables, so you should either invoke sudo with `-E`, or you must set the environment variable after gaining root privileges with sudo.
Release 4.0.4-------------
 \* Fixed autodetection of noexec-mount /tmp directory. Fixes issue #850 and issue #625. \* Fixed a WSGI bug. wsgi.input was a file object opened in text mode, but should be opened in binary mode. Fixes issue #881. \* Fixed a potential crash in Out-of-Band Work. Fixes issue #894. \* Fixed a potential crash in rolling restarting, which only occurs if a process was also being spawned at the same time. Fixes issue #896. \* [Apache] The RailsBaseURI and RackBaseURI directives have been unified. For a long time, RailsBaseURI told Phusion Passenger that the given sub-URI belongs to a \*\*Rails 2\*\* application. Attempt to use this directive with Rails 3 or with Rack applications would result in an error. Because this confused users, RailsBaseURI and RackBaseURI have now been unified and can now be used interchangably. Phusion Passenger will automatically detect what kind of application it is. The Nginx version already worked like this. Fixes issue #882. \* [Standalone] The Passenger Standalone temp directory and PassengerWatchdog server instance directory have been unified. PassengerWatchdog already automatically updates the timestamps of all files in its server instance directory every 6 hours to prevent /tmp cleaners from deleting the directory. Therefore this unification prevents the Passenger Standalone temp directory to be deleted by /tmp cleaners as well. Fixes issue #654. \* [Standalone] types\_hash\_max\_size has been increased from 1024 to 2048. This solves a problem that causes Nginx not to start on some platforms. Contributed by Jan-Willem Koelewijn.
Release 4.0.3-------------
 \* Better protection is now provided against application processes that are stuck and refuse to shut down cleanly. Since version 4.0.0, Phusion Passenger already forcefully shuts down all processes during web server shutdown. In addition to this, 4.0.3 now also forcefully shuts down processes that take more than 1 minute to shut down, even outside the context of web server shutdowns. This feature does not, however, protect against requests that take too long. Use PassengerMaxRequestTime (Apache) or passenger\_max\_request\_time (Nginx) for that. \* Fixed a crash in the HelperAgent which results in frequent process restarts in some traffic patterns. Fixes issue #862. \* Fixed a problem that prevents processes from being spawned correctly if the user's bashrc changes working directory. Fixes issue #851. \* passenger-status now also displays CPU usage. \* The installer now checks for checksums when automatically downloading PCRE and Nginx. Contributed by Joshua Lund. \* An error is now printed when trying to daemonize Phusion Passenger Standalone on Ruby implementations that don't support forking. Contributed by Benjamin Fleischer. \* Although Phusion Passenger already supported JRuby, \*installing\* Phusion Passenger with JRuby was not possible. This has been fixed. \* Various other minor bug fixes.
Release 4.0.2-------------
 \* Bumped the preferred Nginx version to 1.4.1 because of a critical Nginx security vulnerability, CVE-2013-2028. Users are advised to upgrade immediately.
Release 4.0.1-------------
 \* Fixed a crasher bug in the Deployment Error Resistance feature. \* Fixed a bug in PassengerDefaultUser and PassengerDefaultGroup. \* Fixed a bug which could cause application processes to exit before they've finished their request. \* Fixed some small file descriptor leaks. \* Bumped the preferred Nginx version to 1.4.0. \* Editing the Phusion Passenger Standalone Nginx config template is no longer discouraged. \* Improved documentation.
Release 4.0.0 release candidate 6---------------------------------
 \* WebSocket support on Nginx. Requires Nginx >= 1.3.15. \* Improved RVM support. \* Performance optimizations. \* Various bug fixes.
Release 4.0.0 release candidate 5---------------------------------
 \* The default config snippet for Apache has changed! It must now contain a `PassengerDefaultRuby` option. The installer has been updated to output this option. The `PassengerRuby` option still exists, but it's only used for configuring different Ruby interpreters in different contexts. Please refer to the manual for more information. \* We now provide GPG digital signatures for all file releases by Phusion. More information can be found in the manual. \* `passenger-status` now displays process memory usage and time when it was last used. The latter fixes issue #853. \* Exceptions in Rack application objects are now caught to prevent application processes from exiting. \* The `passenger-config` tool now supports the `--ruby-command` argument, which helps the user with figuring out the correct Ruby command to use in case s/he wants to use multiple Ruby interpreters. The manual has also been updated to mention this tool. \* Fixed streaming responses on Apache. \* Worked around an OS X Unix domain socket bug. Fixes issue #854. \* Out-of-Band Garbage Collection now works properly when the application has disabled garbage collection. Fixes issue #859. \* Fixed support for /usr/bin/python on OS X. Fixes issue #855. \* Fixed looping-without-sleeping in the ApplicationPool garbage collector if PassengerPoolIdleTime is set to 0. Fixes issue #858. \* Fixed some process memory usage measurement bugs. \* Fixed process memory usage measurement on NetBSD. Fixes issue #736. \* Fixed a file descriptor leak in the Out-of-Band Work feature. Fixes issue #864. \* The PassengerPreStart helper script now uses the default Ruby interpreter specified in the web server configuration, and no longer requires a `ruby` command to be in `$PATH`. \* Updated preferred PCRE version to 8.32. \* Worked around some RVM bugs. \* The ngx\_http\_stub\_status\_module is now enabled by default. \* Performance optimizations.
Release 4.0.0 release candidate 4---------------------------------
 \* Fixed compilation on systems where /tmp is mounted noexec. \* Fixed some memory corruption bugs. \* Improved debugging messages. \* Phusion Passenger Standalone now sets underscores\_in\_headers. Fixes issue #708. \* Fixed some process spawning compatibility problems, as reported in issue #842. \* The Python WSGI loader now correctly shuts down client sockets even when there are child processes that keep the socket open. \* A new configuration option PassengerPython (Apache) and passenger\_python (Nginx) has been added so that users can customize the Python interpreter on a per-application basis. Fixes issue #852. \* The Apache module now supports file uploads larger than 2 GB when on 32-bit systems. Fixes issue #838. \* The Nginx version now supports the `passenger\_temp\_dir` option. \* Environment variables set in the Nginx configuration file (through the `env` config option) are now correctly passed to all application processes. Fixes issue #371. \* Fixed support for RVM mixed mode installations. Fixes issue #828. \* Phusion Passenger now outputs the Date HTTP header in case the application didn't already do that (and was violating the HTTP spec). Fixes issue #485. \* Phusion Passenger now checks whether /dev/urandom isn't broken. Fixes issue #516.
Release 3.9.5 (4.0.0 release candidate 3)-----------------------------------------
 \* Fixed Rake autodetection.
Release 3.9.4 (4.0.0 release candidate 2)-----------------------------------------
 \* More bug fixes. \* More documentation updates. \* Better crash diagnostics.
Release 3.9.3 (4.0.0 release candidate 1)-----------------------------------------
 \* The Nginx version now supports the `passenger\_app\_root` configuration option. \* The Enterprise memory limiting feature has been extended to work with non-Ruby applications as well. \* Application processes that have been killed are now automatically detected within 5 seconds. Previously Phusion Passenger needed to send a request to the process before detecting that it's gone. This change means that when you kill a process by sending it a signal, Phusion Passenger will automatically respawn it within 5 seconds (provided that the process limit settings allow respawning). \* Phusion Passenger Standalone's HTTP client body limit has been raised from 50 MB to 1 GB. \* Python 3 support has been added. \* The build system has been made compatible with JRuby and Ruby 2.0. \* The installers now print a lot more information about detected system settings so that the user can see whether something has been wrongly detected. \* Some performance optimizations. These involve further extending the zero-copy architecture, and the use of hash table maps instead of binary tree maps. \* Many potential crasher and freezer bugs have been fixed. \* Error diagnostics have been further improved. \* Many documentation improvements.
Release 3.9.2 (4.0.0 beta 2)----------------------------
 \* New feature: JRuby and Rubinius support. \* New feature: Out of Band Work. \* Sending SIGBART to a Ruby process will now trigger the same behavior as SIGQUIT - that is, it will print a backtrace. This is necessary for proper JRuby support because JRuby cannot catch SIGQUIT. \* Rolling restarts and depoyment error resistance are now also available in Phusion Passenger Standalone in the Enterprise version. \* System call failure simulation framework. \* Improved crash reporting. \* Many documentation improvements. \* Many bug fixes.
Release 3.9.1 (4.0.0 beta 1)----------------------------
This is the first beta of Phusion Passenger 4. The changes are numerous.
 \* Support for multiple Ruby versions. \* The internals now use evented I/O. \* Real-time response buffering. \* Improved zero-copy architecture. \* Rewritten ApplicationPool and process spawning subsystem. \* Multithreading within Ruby apps (Phusion Passenger Enterprise only). \* Python WSGI support lifted to "beta" status. \* More protection against stuck processes. \* Automatically picks up environment variables from your bashrc. \* Allows setting environment variables directly in Apache. \* Automatic asset pipeline support in Standalone. \* Deleting restart.txt no longer triggers a restart. \* More stable Union Station support. \* Many internal robustness improvements. \* Better relocatability without wasting space.

 \* Updated documentation. \* Updated website links.
Release 3.0.14--------------
 \* [Apache] Fixed a long-standing mod\_rewrite-related problem. Some mod\_rewrite rules would not work, but it depends on the exact mod\_rewrite configuration so it would work for some people but not for others. Issue #563. Thanks a lot to cedricmaion for providing information on the nature of the bug and to peter.nash55 for providing a VM that allowed us to reproduce the problem. \* [Nginx] Preferred Nginx version to 1.2.2. The previously preferred version was 1.2.1. \* Cleared some confusing terminology in the documentation. \* Fixed some Ruby 1.9 encoding problems.

The issue is documented at http://www.nginx.org/en/security\_advisories.html and affects more modules than just Phusion Passenger. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Patch submitted by Gregory Potamianos. \* [Nginx] passenger\_show\_version\_in\_header now hides the Phusion Passenger version number from the 'Server:' header too. Patch submitted by Gregory Potamianos. \* Fixed a /proc deprecation warning on Linux kernel >= 3.0.
Release 3.0.11--------------
 \* Fixed a compilation problem on platforms without alloca.h, such as FreeBSD 7. \* Improved performance and solved some warnings on Xen systems by compiling with `-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs`. Patch contributed by Michał Pokrywka.
Release 3.0.10--------------
 \* [Nginx] Dropped support for Nginx versions older than 1.0.0 \* [Nginx] Fixed support for Nginx 1.1.4+ \* [Nginx, Standalone] Upgraded default Nginx version to 1.0.10 The previously default version was 1.0.5. \* [Nginx] New option passenger\_max\_requests This is equivalent to the PassengerMaxRequests option in the Apache version: Phusion Passenger will automatically shutdown a worker process once it has processed the specified number of requests. Contributed by Paul Kmiec. \* [Apache] New option PassengerBufferResponse The Apache version did not buffer responses. This could block the Ruby worker process in case of slow clients. We now enable response buffering by default. It can be turned off through this option. Feature contributed by Ryo Onodera. \* Fixed remaining Ruby 1.9.3 compatibility problems We already supported Ruby 1.9.3 since 3.0.8, but due to bugs in Ruby 1.9.3's build system Phusion Passenger would fail to detect Ruby 1.9.3 features on some systems. Fixes issue #714. \* Fixed a bug in PassengerPreStart A regression was introduced in 3.0.8, causing the prespawn script to connect to the host name instead of to 127.0.0.1. Fix contributed by Andy Allan. \* Fixed compatibility with GCC 4.6 Affected systems include Ubuntu 11.10. \* Fixed various compilation problems. \* Fixed some Ruby 1.9 encoding problems. \* Fixed some Ruby 1.9.3 deprecation warnings.

Release 3.0.8-------------
 \* [Nginx] Upgraded preferred Nginx version to 1.0.5. \* [Nginx] Fixed various compilation problems on various platforms. \* [Nginx] We now ensure that SERVER\_NAME is equal to HTTP\_HOST without the port part. This is needed for Rack compliance. By default Nginx sets SERVER\_NAME to whatever is specified in the server\_name directive, but that's not necessarily the correct value. This fixes, for example, the use of the 'map' statement in config.ru. \* [Nginx] Added the options passenger\_buffer\_size, passenger\_buffers and passenger\_busy\_buffers\_size. These options are similar to proxy\_module's similarly named options. You can use these to e.g. increase the maximum header size limit. \* [Nginx] passenger\_pre\_start now supports virtual hosts that listen on Unix domain sockets. \* [Apache] Fixed the pcre.h compilation problem. \* [Standalone] Fixed 'passenger stop'. It didn't work properly because it kept waiting for 'tail' to exit. We now properly terminate 'tail' as well. \* Fixed compatibility with Rake 0.9. \* Fixed various Ruby 1.9 compatibility issues. \* Various documentation improvements. \* New Union Station filter language features. It now supports status codes and response times. Please refer to https://engage.unionstationapp.com/help#filtering for more information.
Release 3.0.7-------------
 \* Fixed a bug passenger-install-apache2-module. It could crash on some systems due to a typo in the code. \* Upgraded preferred Nginx version to 1.0.0. \* Phusion Passenger Standalone now pre-starts application processes at startup instead of doing that at the first request. \* When sending data to Union Station, the HTTP status code is now also logged. \* Various Union Station-related stability improvements. \* The Linux OOM killer was previously erroneously disabled for all Phusion Passenger processes, including application processes. The intention was to only disable it for the Watchdog. This has been fixed, and the Watchdog is now the only process for which the OOM killer is disabled. \* Fixed some compilation problems on OpenBSD. \* Due to a typo, the dependency on file-tail was not entirely removed in 3.0.6. This has now been fixed.
Release 3.0.6-------------
 \* Fixed various compilation problems such as XCode 4 support and OpenBSD support. \* Fixed various Union Station-related stability issues. \* Fixed an issue with host name detection on certain platforms. \* Improved error logging in various parts. \* The dependency on the file-tail library has been removed. \* During installation, check whether /tmp is mounted with 'noexec'. Phusion Passenger's installer relies on /tmp \*not\* being mounted with 'noexec'. If it is then the installer will now show a helpful error message instead of bailing out in a confusing manner. Users can now tell the installer to use a different directory for storing temporary files by customizing the $TMPDIR environment variable. \* Phusion Passenger Standalone can now run Rackup files that are not named 'config.ru'. The filename can be passed through the command line using the -R option.
Release 3.0.5-------------
 \* [Apache] Fixed Union Station process statistics collection Union Station users that are using Apache may notice that no process information show up in Union Station. This is because of a bug in Phusion Passenger's Apache version, which has now been fixed. \* [Apache] PassengerAnalytics has been renamed to UnionStationSupport This option has been renamed for consistency reasons. \* [Nginx] passenger\_analytics has been renamed to union\_station\_support This option has been renamed for consistency reasons. \* Fixed Union Station data sending on older libcurl versions Some Union Station users have reported that their data don't show up. Upon investigation this turned out to be a compatibility with older libcurl versions. Affected systems include all RHEL 5 based systems, such as RHEL 5.5 and CentOS 5.5. We've now fixed compatibility with older libcurl versions. \* Added support for the Union Station filter language This language can be used to limit the kind of data that's sent to Union Station. Please read https://engage.unionstationapp.com/help#filtering for details. \* Fixed a PassengerMaxPoolSize/passenger\_max\_pool\_size violation bug People who host a lot of different applications on Phusion Passenger may notice that it sometimes spawns more processes than is allowed by PassengerMaxPoolSize/passenger\_max\_pool\_size. This has been fixed.
Release 3.0.4-------------
 \* [Apache] Changed mod\_dir workaround hook priority Phusion Passenger temporarily disables mod\_dir on all Phusion Passenger-handled requests in order to avoid conflicts. In order to do this it registers some Apache hooks with the APR\_HOOK\_MIDDLE priority, but it turned out that this breaks some other modules like mod\_python. The hook priority has been changed to APR\_HOOK\_LAST to match mod\_dir's hook priorities. Issue reported by Jay Freeman. \* Added support for Union Station: http://www.unionstationapp.com/ \* Some error messages have been improved.
Release 3.0.3-------------
 \* [Nginx] Preferred Nginx version upgraded to 0.8.54 The previous preferred version was 0.8.53. \* PATH\_INFO and REQUEST\_URI now contain the original escaped URI Phusion Passenger passes the URI, as reported by Apache/Nginx, to application processes through the PATH\_INFO and REQUEST\_URI variables. These variables are supposed to contain the original, unescaped URI, e.g. /clubs/%C3%BC. Both Apache and Nginx thought that it would be a good idea to unescape the URI before passing it to modules like Phusion Passenger, thereby causing PATH\_INFO and REQUEST\_URI to contain the unescaped URI, e.g. /clubs/ü. This causes all sorts of encoding problems. We now manually re-escape the URI when setting PATH\_INFO and REQUEST\_URI. Issue #404. \* The installer no longer detects directories as potential commands Previously the installer would look in $PATH for everything that's executable, including directories. If one has /usr/lib in $PATH and a directory /usr/lib/gcc exists then the installer would recognize /usr/lib/gcc as the compiler. We now explicitly check whether the item is also a file. \* PseudoIO now responds to #to\_io Phusion Passenger sets STDERR to a PseudoIO object in order to capture anything written to STDERR during application startup. This breaks some libraries which expect STDERR to respond to #to\_io. This has now been fixed. Issue #607. \* Fixed various other minor bugs See the git commit log for details.
Release 3.0.2-------------
 \* [Nginx] Fixed compilation problems The Nginx compilation process was broken due to not correctly reverting the working directory of the Nginx configure script. This has been fixed: issue #595. \* [Nginx] Fixed crash if passenger\_root refers to a nonexistant directory Issue #599. \* Fixed compilation problems on NetBSD There was a typo in a NetBSD-specific fcntl() call. It also turns out that NetBSD doesn't support some ISO C99 math functions like llroundl(); this has been worked around by using other functions. Issue #593. \* Fixed file descriptor closing issues on FreeBSD Phusion Passenger child processes didn't correct close file descriptors on FreeBSD because it queries /dev/fd to do that. On FreeBSD /dev/fd only returns meaningful results if fdescfs is mounted, which it isn't by default. Issue #597.
Release 3.0.1-------------
 \* MUCH faster compilation We've applied code aggregation techniques, allowing Phusion Passenger to be compiled much quicker now. For example, compiling the Nginx component (not Nginx itself) on a MacBook Pro now takes only 29 seconds instead of 51 seconds, an improvement of 75%! Compiling the Apache module on a slower Dell Inspiron now takes 39 seconds instead of 1 minute 22 seconds, or 110% faster! \* Fixed malfunction after web server restart On Linux systems that have a non-standard filesystem on /tmp, Phusion Passenger could malfunction after restarting the web server because of a bug that's only triggered on certain filesystems. Issue #569. \* Boost upgraded to version 1.44.0. We were on 1.42.0. \* Much improved startup error messages Phusion Passenger performs many extensive checks during startup to ensure integrity. However the error message in some situation could be vague. These startup error messages have now been improved dramatically, so that if something goes wrong during startup you will now more likely know why. \* Curl < 7.12.1 is now supported The previous version fails to compile with Curl versions earlier than 7.12.1. Issue #556. \* passenger-make-enterprisey fixed This is the command that people can run after donating. It allows people to slightly modify Phusion Passenger's display name as a joke. In 3.0.0 it was broken because of a typo. This has been fixed. \* Removed passenger-stress-test This tool was used during the early life of Phusion Passenger for stress testing websites. Its performance has never been very good and there are much better tools for stress testing, so this tool has now been removed. \* [Apache] RailsEnv and RackEnv configuration options are now equivalent In previous versions, RailsEnv only had effect on Rails 1 and Rails 2 apps while RackEnv only had effect on Rack apps. Because Rails 3 apps are considered Rack apps, setting RailsEnv had no effect on Rails 3 apps. Because this is confusing to users, we've now made RailsEnv and RackEnv equivalent. Issue #579. \* [Nginx] Fixed compilation problems on systems with unpowerful shells Most notably Solaris. Its default shell does not support some basic constructs that we used in the Nginx configure script. \* [Nginx] Upgraded default Nginx version to to 0.8.53 The previous default was 0.8.52. \* [Nginx] passenger\_enabled now only accepts 'on' or 'off' values Previously it would recognize any value not equal to 'on' as meaning 'off'. This caused confusion among users who thought they could also specify 'true', so we now throw a proper error if the value is unrecognized. Fixes issue #583.
Release 3.0.0-------------
This is a major release with many changes. Please read our blog for details.
Release 2.2.15--------------
 \* [Apache] Fixed incorrect temp dir cleanup by passenger-status On some systems, running passenger-status could print the following message:  \*\*\* Cleaning stale folder /tmp/passenger.1234  ...after which Phusion Passenger breaks because that directory is necessary for it to function properly. The cause of this problem has been found and has been fixed. \* [Apache] Fixed some upload handling problems Previous versions of Phusion Passenger check whether the size of the received upload data matches the contents of the Content-Length header as received by the client. It turns out that there could be a mismatch e.g. because of mod\_deflate input compression, so we can't trust Content-Length anyway and we're being too strict. The check has now been removed. \* [Nginx] Fixed compilation issues with Nginx >= 0.7.66 Thanks to Potamianos Gregory for reporting this issue. Issue #500. \* [Nginx] Default Nginx version changed to 0.7.67 The previous default version was 0.7.65. \* Fixed more Bundler problems Previous versions of Phusion Passenger would preload some popular libraries such as mysql and sqlite3 in order to utilize copy-on-write optimizations better. However this behavior conflicts with Bundler so we've removed it.
Release 2.2.14--------------
 \* Added support for Rubinius Patch contributed by Evan Phoenix. \* Fixed a mistake in the SIGQUIT backtrace message. Patch contributed by Christoffer Sawicki. \* [Nginx] Fix a localtime() crash on FreeBSD This was caused by insufficient stack space for threads. Issue #499.
Release 2.2.13--------------
 \* Fixed some Rails 3 compatibility issues that were recently introduced. \* Fixed a typo that causes config/setup\_load\_paths.rb not to be loaded correctly.
Release 2.2.12--------------
 \* Improved Bundler support. Previous versions might not be able to correctly load gems bundled by Bundler. We've also documented how our Bundler support works and how to override our support if you need special behavior. Please refer to the Phusion Passenger Users Guide, section "Bundler support". \* Worked around some user account handling bugs in Ruby. Issue #192. \* Fixed some Ruby 1.9 tempfile.rb compatibility problems. \* Fixed some compilation problems on some ARM Linux platforms. \* [Apache] Suppress bogus mod\_xsendfile-related error messages. When mod\_xsendfile is being used, Phusion Passenger might print bogus error messages like "EPIPE" or "Apache stopped forwarding the backend's response" to the log file. These messages are normal, are harmless and can be safely ignored, but they pollute the log file. So in this release we've added code to suppress these messages when mod\_xsendfile is being used. Issue #474. \* [Nginx] Fixed "passenger\_user\_switching off" permission problems If Nginx is running as root and passenger\_user\_switching is turned off, then Phusion Passenger would fail to initialize because of a permission problem. This has been fixed. Issue #458. \* [Nginx] Nginx >= 0.8.38 is now supported. Thanks to Sergey A. Osokin for reporting the problem. \* [Nginx] passenger-install-nginx-module upgraded It now defaults to installing Nginx 0.7.65 instead of 0.7.64.
Release 2.2.11--------------
 \* This release fixes a regression that appeared in 2.2.10 which only affects Apache. When under high load, Apache might freeze and stop responding to requests. It is caused by a race condition which is why it escaped our last release testing.  This problem does not affect Nginx; you only have to upgrade if you're using Apache.  http://groups.google.com/group/phusion-passenger/t/d5bb2f17c8446ea0
Release 2.2.10--------------
 \* Fixed some Bundler compatibility problems. \* Fixed some file descriptor passing problems, which previously could lead to mysterious crashes. \* Fixed some compilation problems on newer GCC versions. Issue #430. \* Support #size method in rack.input.
Release 2.2.9-------------
 \* Fixed compatibility with Rails 3. Actually, previous Phusion Passenger releases were already compatible with Rails 3, depending on the spawn method that would be invoked. Here's the story:  Since Phusion Passenger 2.2.8, when the file config.ru exists, Phusion Passenger will treat the app as a Rack app, not as a Rails app. This is in contrast to earlier versions which gave Rails detection more priority than Rack detection. Phusion Passenger loads Rack apps and Rails apps in different ways. The Rails loader was not compatible with Rails 3, which is what we've fixed in this release.  That said, a Rails 3 app would have worked out-of-the-box on Phusion Passenger 2.2.8 as well because Rails 3 apps include a config.ru file by default, causing Phusion Passenger 2.2.8 to use the Rack loader. Earlier versions of Phusion Passenger would just completely bail out because they'd use the Rails loader.  That said, with 2.2.9 there are still some caveats: - Smart spawning (the mechanism with which REE's 33% memory reduction is implemented) is \*not\* supported for Rack apps. This means that if you want to utilize smart spawning with Rails 3, then you should remove your config.ru file. - Rails 3 depends on Rack 1.1.0. You must have Rack 1.1.0 installed as a gem, even if you've bundled it with the gem bundler. This is because Phusion Passenger itself depends on Rack.  Both of these caveats are temporary. We have plans to solve both of these properly in the future. \* What's up with the Gem Bundler? There has been some reports that Phusion Passenger is not compatible with Yehuda Katz's gem bundler (http://github.com/wycats/bundler). This might have been true for an earlier version of the gem bundler, but the latest version seems to work fine. Please note that you need to insert the following snippet in config/preinitializer.rb, as instructed by the gem bundler's README:  require "#{RAILS\_ROOT}/vendor/gems/environment"  The Rails::Boot monkey patching code as posted at http://yehudakatz.com/2009/11/03/using-the-new-gem-bundler-today/ does not seem to be required anymore. \* Fixed support for ActiveRecord subclasses that connect to another database. ActiveRecord subclasses that connect to a database other than the default one did not have their connection correctly cleared after forking. This can result in weird errors along the lines of "Lost connection to MySQL server during query". Issue #429. \* [Nginx] Fixed PCRE URL. passenger-install-nginx-module downloads PCRE 7.8 if PCRE is not already installed. However PCRE 7.8 has been removed from their FTP server, so we've updated the URL to point to the latest version, 8.0.
Release 2.2.8-------------
 \* [Nginx] Fixed some signal handling problems. Restarting Nginx on OS X with SIGHUP can sometimes take a long time or even fail completely. This is because of some signal handling problems, which have now been fixed. \* [Nginx] Added OpenSSL as dependency. OpenSSL is required in order to install Nginx, but this was not checked by passenger-install-nginx-module. As a result, passenger-install-nginx-module fails on e.g. out-of-the-box Ubuntu installations until the user manually installs OpenSSL. Issue #422. \* [Nginx] Fixed support for internal redirects and subrequests. It is now possible to, for example, point X-Accel-Redirects to Phusion Passenger-served URLs. Patch contributed by W. Andrew Loe III: issue #433. \* [Apache] Fixed a GnuTLS compatibility issue. mod\_gnutls can cause Phusion Passenger to crash because of an unchecked NULL pointer. This problem has now been fixed: issue #391. \* Fixed thread creation issue on Intel Itanium platforms. This fixes issue #427. \* Fixed compilation problems on Linux running on the Renesas SH4 CPU. Patch contributed by iwamatsu: issue #428. \* The Rack library has been unvendored. The original reason for vendoring was to work around broken Rails applications that explicitly specify Rack as a gem dependency. We've found a better workaround that does not require vendoring Rack. This also fixes a compatibility problem with Rails 3, because Rails 3 depends on a newer Rack version than the one we had vendored. Issue #432. \* Fixed compatibility with Ruby 1.9.1 patchlevel >= 152 Ruby 1.9.1 patchlevel >= 152 has a bug in its tempfile library. If you've seen an error message along the lines of
 \*\*\* Exception IOError in Passenger RequestHandler (closed stream)  then this is a Ruby bug at work. This bug has been fixed in Ruby 1.9.2, but Ruby 1.9.1 still contains this bug. We've added a workaround so that the bug is not triggered with this Ruby version. Issue #432.
Release 2.2.7-------------
 \* Removed forgotten debugging code in passenger-install-apache2-module, which caused it not to compile anything.
Release 2.2.6-------------
 \* Some /tmp cleaner programs such as tmpwatch try to remove subdirectories in /tmp/passenger.xxx after a while because they think those subdirectories are unused. This could cause Phusion Passenger to malfunction, requiring a web server restart. Measures have now been taken to prevent those tmp cleaner programs from removing anything in /tmp/passenger.xxx. Issue #365. \* When autodetecting the application type, Rack is now given more priority than Rails. This allows one to drop a config.ru file in a Rails directory and have it detected as a Rack application instead of a Rails application. Patch contributed by Sam Pohlenz: issue #338. \* The default socket backlog has been increased from 'SOMAXCONN' (which is 128 on most platforms) to 1024. This should fix most 'helper\_server.sock failed: Resource temporarily unavailable' errors. \* Fixed compilation problems on Solaris. Issue #369 and issue #379. \* Fixed crashes on PowerPC. \* Some Ruby 1.9 compatibility fixes. Issue #398. \* The installer now displays correct dependency installation instructions for Mandriva Linux. \* [Apache] The location of the 'apxs' and 'apr-config' commands can now also be passed to the installer through the --apxs-path and --apr-config-path parameters, in addition to the $APXS2 and $APR\_CONFIG environment variables. Issue #3. \* [Nginx] Various problems that only occur on 64-bit platforms have been fixed. \* [Nginx] The installer now installs Nginx 0.7.64 by default.
Release 2.2.5-------------
 \* [Apache] Small file uploads are now buffered; fixes potential DoS attack Phusion Passenger buffers large file uploads to temp files so that it doesn't block applications while an upload is in progress, but it sent small uploads directly to the application without buffering it. This could result in a potential DoS attack: the client can send many small, incomplete file uploads to the server, and this would block all application processes until a timeout occurs. In order to solve this problem, Phusion Passenger now buffers small file uploads in memory. Bug #356.
 \* [Apache] Fixed support for mod\_rewrite passthrough rules Mod\_rewrite passthrough rules were not properly supported because of a bug fix for supporting encoded slashes (%2f) in URLs. Unfortunately, due to bugs/limitations in Apache, we can support either encoded slashes or mod\_rewrite passthrough rules, but not both; supporting one will break the other.
 Support for mod\_rewrite passthrough rules is now enabled by default; that is, support for encoded slashes is disabled by default. A new configuration option, "PassengerAllowEncodedSlashes", has been added. Turning this option on will enable support for encoded slashes and disable support for mod\_rewrite passthrough rules.
 Issue #113 and issue #230.
 \* [Apache] Added a configuration option for resolving symlinks in the document root path Phusion Passenger 2.2.0 and higher no longer resolves symlinks in the document root path in order to properly support Capistrano-style directory structures. The exact behavior is documented in the Users Guide, section "How Phusion Passenger detects whether a virtual host is a web application".
 However, some people relied on the old behavior. A new configuration option, PassengerResolveSymlinksInDocumentRoot, has been added to allow reverting back to the old behavior.
 Patch contributed by Locaweb (http://www.locaweb.com.br/).
 \* [Apache] mod\_env variables are now also passed through CGI environment headers Prior to version 2.2.3, environment variables set by mod\_env are passed to the application as CGI environment headers, not through Ruby's ENV variable. In the last release we introduced support for setting ENV environment variables with mod\_env, and got rid of the code for setting CGI environment headers. It turns out that some people relied on the old behavior, we so now environment variables set with mod\_env are set in both ENV and in the CGI environment.  Fixes bug #335.
 \* [Apache] Fixed compilation problems on some Linux systems with older versions of Apache If you used to see compilation errors like this:
 ext/apache2/Configuration.cpp:554: error: expected primary-expression before '.' token
 then this version should compile properly.
 \* [Apache] Fixed I/O timeouts for communication with backend processes Got rid of the code for enforcing I/O timeouts when reading from or writing to a backend process. This caused more problems than it solved.
 \* [Nginx] Support for streaming responses (e.g. Comet or HTTP push) Buffering of backend responses is now disabled. This fixes support for streaming responses, something which the Apache version has supported for a while now. One can generate streaming responses in Ruby on Rails like this:
 render :text => lambda { |response, output| 10\_000.times do |i| output.write("hello #{i}!\n") end }
 \* [Nginx] Installer now installs Nginx 0.7.61 by default Previously it installed 0.6.37 by default.
 \* [Nginx] Fixed the installer's --extra-configure-flags flag when combined with --auto-download Arguments passed to --extra-configure-flags were not being passed to the Nginx configure script when --auto-download is given. This has been fixed: bug #349.
 \* [Nginx] Fixed unnecessary download of PCRE The installer now checks whether PCRE is installed in /opt/local (e.g. MacPorts) as well before concluding that it isn't installed and going ahead with downloading PCRE.
 \* Fixed STDERR capturing While spawning an application, Phusion Passenger captures any output written to STDERR so that it can show them later if the application failed to start. This turns out to be much more difficult than expected, with all kinds of corner cases that can mess up this feature.
 For example, if the Rails log file is not writable, then this can cause Rails to crash with a bizarre and unhelpful error message whenever it tries to write to STDERR:
 /!\ FAILSAFE /!\ Thu Aug 20 14:58:39 +1000 2009 Status: 500 Internal Server Error undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass
 Some applications reopen STDERR to a log file. This didn't work.
 Of all of these problems have been fixed now. (Bug #332)
 \* Fixed some bugs in application sources preloading Rails >= 2.2 already preloads the application sources, in which case Phusion Passenger wasn't supposed to perform it's own preloading, but the Rails[View remainder of file in raw view](https://github.com/phusion/passenger/raw/refs/tags/release-4.0.6/NEWS)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=985633#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-07-18 00:09:32 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that Phusion Passenger would reuse existing server instance directories (temporary directories) which could cause Passenger to remove or overwrite files belonging to other instances.  This has been corrected in upstream version 4.0.8 [3] via two fixes (the initial fix [4] and a regression fix [5]; both are required to fully fix the issue).  This is an issue similar to [CVE-2013-2119](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2119).
