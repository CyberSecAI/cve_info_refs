{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The http_payload_subdissector function in epan/dissectors/packet-http.c in the HTTP dissector does not properly determine when to use a recursive approach.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of recursion",
      "Stack exhaustion"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted packet which leads to stack consumption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malformed packet over the network",
      "Opening a malicious packet trace file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted network packet to a system running wireshark or trick a user into opening a malicious capture file.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located within the HTTP dissector in Wireshark versions 1.6.x before 1.6.16 and 1.8.x before 1.8.8. The fix involves adjusting the dissector logic to prevent excessive recursion. The vulnerability is present when using Wireshark to analyze HTTP traffic, therefore the impact is limited to machines running Wireshark."
