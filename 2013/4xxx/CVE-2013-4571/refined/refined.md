Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4571:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `luasandbox` PHP extension.
*   The issue arises from the lack of stack size checks when pushing values onto the Lua stack during data exchange between PHP and Lua. Specifically, `lua_checkstack` function is not called before pushing onto the stack which is necessary to expand the Lua stack size.
*   The `lua_push*` functions do not perform checks unless compiled with specific debug options.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow in memory allocated via `malloc`. When the Lua stack exceeds its allocated size without proper bounds checking or stack expansion using `lua_checkstack`, it overflows into adjacent memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Crash/Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow leads to a crash of the PHP process. This can be used by an attacker to cause a denial of service.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** It's also mentioned that it's not known if this buffer overflow could be used to achieve code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Calling Lua functions from PHP with a large amount of data:** Passing a large number of arguments or return values between PHP and Lua can trigger the overflow if the Lua stack is not large enough.
*   **Specific Lua Functions:** As described in the bug report, a one-liner such as `mw.ustring.codepoint( string.rep( 'x', 1000 ), 1, -1)` can trigger the overflow. The size of the string (1000 in the example) depends on existing Lua stack size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to execute Lua code within the context of the vulnerable PHP application (e.g., via Scribunto extension in MediaWiki).

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided content mentions that the fix for this vulnerability involves calling `luaL_checkstack` to ensure sufficient stack space before pushing values onto the Lua stack.
*   The vulnerability was discovered through an internal review.
*   The issue was addressed in version 1.7-1 of the `php-luasandbox` package.
*   The fix was included in MediaWiki security releases 1.22.1, 1.21.4, and 1.19.10.
*   The provided text also mentions CVE-2013-4570, which is related to a NULL pointer dereference in `php-luasandbox`.
