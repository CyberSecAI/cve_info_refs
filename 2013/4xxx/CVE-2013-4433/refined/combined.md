| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1018114#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2013-10-11 09:24:21 UTC  ``` xhprof, a hierarchial profiler for PHP, was found to have a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in it's run parameter, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize the user input.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must entice an unsuspecting user to follow a malicious URI, which could compromise the cookie-based authentication information, execute arbitrary client-side scripts in the context of the browser, or obtain sensitive information.  The issue is known to be fixed in Xhprof 0.9.4.  References:  <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/62928/info> <http://pecl.php.net/package-changelog.php?package=xhprof&release=0.9.4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1018114#c1)  Ratul Gupta    2013-10-11 09:25:44 UTC  ```  Created php-pecl-xhprof tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1018115](show_bug.cgi?id=1018115 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - php-pecl-xhprof: xhprof: XSS vulnerability in run parameter [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1018116](show_bug.cgi?id=1018116 "CLOSED ERRATA - php-pecl-xhprof: xhprof: XSS vulnerability in run parameter [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1018114#c2)  Remi Collet    2013-10-11 09:32:31 UTC  ``` Note : in xhprof RPM, the WebUI is protected and only allowed from the server (localhost).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1018114#c3)  Murray McAllister    2013-10-14 01:04:57 UTC  ``` CVE request: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/10/14/1>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1018114#c4)  Fedora Update System    2013-10-17 18:06:01 UTC  ``` php-pecl-xhprof-0.9.4-1.el6 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 6 stable repository.
