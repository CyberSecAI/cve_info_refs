{
  "cveId": "CVE-2013-4566",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the way mod_nss handled the NSSVerifyClient setting for the per-directory context. When configured to not require a client certificate for the initial connection and only require it for a specific directory, mod_nss failed to enforce this requirement and allowed a client to access the directory when no valid client certificate was provided.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "Incorrect handling of the NSSVerifyClient setting in mod_nss when used in both server/vhost context and directory context.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "mod_nss failed to properly enforce client certificate authentication requirements for specific directories when 'NSSVerifyClient none' was set at the server/vhost level."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could access content of restricted directories without a valid client certificate.",
       "attackVectors": [
        "A remote attacker can connect to a web server using the vulnerable mod_nss configuration."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to connect to the web server. No special capabilities are needed besides basic network connectivity and knowledge of the server's configuration. No authentication is required prior to the exploit."
