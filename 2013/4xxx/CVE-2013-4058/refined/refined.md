Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-4058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to flaws in the web user interface (Web UI). Specifically, the web console is susceptible to vulnerabilities that can be exploited through blind SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection flaw. This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code but may not see the results directly. Instead, they would infer the outcome based on the application's behavior or timing differences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to potentially access or manipulate sensitive data within the database. This could result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or data corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web UI:** The attack vector is through the web user interface of the InfoSphere Information Server. This suggests the vulnerability lies in how the application handles user input or requests when interacting with the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to send malicious requests to the web UI of the application. This might require network access to the server running the vulnerable InfoSphere Information Server instance.
*   The attacker would need knowledge of SQL syntax and the database structure to craft appropriate injection queries.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   IBM InfoSphere Information Server Versions 8.0, 8.1, 8.5, 8.7, and 9.1 running on all platforms.
