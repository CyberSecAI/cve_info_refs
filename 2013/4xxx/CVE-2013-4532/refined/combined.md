hw/net/stellaris\_enet: Convert to vmstate

```
Convert this device to use vmstate for its save/load, including
providing a post_load function that sanitizes inbound data to
avoid possible buffer overflows if it is malicious.

The sanitizing fixes [CVE-2013-4532](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6fpp-r2v5-x6rq "CVE-2013-4532") (though nobody should be
relying on the security properties of most of the unmaintained
ARM board models anyway, and migration doesn't actually
work on this board due to issues in other device models).

These are all about the same thing, with references to 23 patches
from the same thread starting there:

 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-12/msg00394.html>

It is about state loading issues, which is about migration between
two (hopefully) qemu instances or guest save/load functionality.
The first message in the series explains conditions when this can
happen.

In particular, this conclusion:

 Considering the preconditions, I think that the impact on typical
 qemu usage is low.  Still, I think these patches make sense for
 qemu-stable.

So it has even been questioned whenever those fixes are good for
the next qemu stable release or not.

But now I'm not really sure what to do with this bugreport.  It
is a good amount of work, especially to backport those to wheezy
(since code changed significantly since that), with quite low
outcome (because the whole thing does not seem very important,
even for qemu developers - note that this patchset hasn't been
applied still, which might be due to another issue in qemu
community).

So.. oh well.  I'd really love to not backport all this shit to
wheezy... ;)

Thanks,

/mjt

I had missed the initial mail from the thread, that explains it well
enough. I agree that the attack scenario during migration between
nodes is negligable and a non-issue.

But I don't understand what is meant by the second part:

| * Saving/Loading state to/from file.

| <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=588133#c8>

The RH bugs are restricted and I don't understand what is meant with
"saving/loading state to/from file". Is this about snapshots or
malformed images? Do you have an idea?

> So.. oh well.  I'd really love to not backport all this shit to

If "Saving/Loading state to/from file" is negligable as well,
I would mark it as a non-issue in the tracker.

Feel free to downgrade to non-RC severity until the patches
are merged in 1.8.

It isn't exactly a non-issue really, or else it'd not be necessary to
assign (multiple) CVE IDs.  Even with migration scenario there are
possibilities to exploit these by using one of these vulnerabilities
together with some other vulnerability (and this is mentioned in
the first email in that thread).  Impact is quite low still.

It is like snapshots, yes.  One can save a guest memory image into
a file and load it later.  It is pretty much like migration (and
implemented using the same mechanism), but with a delay between
saving and loading.

One of the bugs mentioned above is about giving developer such a
saved file from local qemu asking for help in diagnosing an apparent
bug, and that image will try to exploit developer's qemu by using
one of these flaws.  Something like that anyway -- see
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-12/msg00612.html>

Another possible scenario is someone distributing virtual machines
for end-users, trying to exploit their qemu.

Unlike for, say, gif images or word documents or whatever, qemu
guest image _may_ come in one of 2 forms: it is just the drive
image (content of virtual hard drive), which you run and it boots
from the beginning as your regular PC will do.  Or this drive
image coupled with memory image, so when you run it, your system
is in some non-initial runtime state.  It is definitely unusual
to distribute something in the second form, together with the
memory state.

So I can imagine someone selling pre-loaded virtual machines
(doing it this way, together with memory state, is rare but can
have its reasons too, say, for a system which require significant
boot time).  Or, for example, your qemu/kvm hosting provider can
have a function to transfer whole your virtual machine (together
with the memory state) to you - either in terms of files like
that, or using online migration.

When you perform save/load locally in your usual environment where
you run qemu, you don't let stranger to modify the memory state
files created by qemu.  So locally this is not exploitable (unless
you use already hacked/modified qemu to create the images in the
first place, but that's obviously not very interesting case).

Both ways to "use" one of these vulns are real, but both are quite
difficult to use, hence the probably-low-impact.

Basically we've two possible ways to use these vulns.

First is to "spread" a break-in to other machines by, after breaking
into one machine (using some other way) and hacking qemu on it, it
becomes possible to break into qemu on the receiving-migration machine.

And second is when someone gives whole guest image (together with the
memory state) to you, tricking you to run it one way or another.

That's what issues are all about.  Not very serious, but not a non-issue
either.

Note that, while many people has been involved in code audit and
patching, the series received quite good criticism from Peter
Maydell who offerent alternative ways to fix some of the issues
or questioned validity of the proposed fixes, with not much
discussion following.

I'll ping this thread again - it's not nice when such a large
and good work is being thrown away.

BTW, next version of qemu will most likely be 2.0.  Without any
good reason for that :)

Thanks,

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1066358#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-02-18 09:44:04 UTC  ``` Three issues were found:  * s->next_packet is read from wire as an index into s->rx[].  * s->tx_fifo_len is read from the wire and later used as an index into      s->tx_fifo[] when a DATA command is issued by the guest.  * s->tx_frame_len is read from the wire and can later used as an index      into s->tx_fifo[] for memset() when a DATA command is issued by the      guest.  An user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use this flaw to to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.  References: <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-12/msg00403.html> <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-12/msg00414.html> <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-12/msg00404.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1066358#c1)  Petr Matousek    2014-02-18 11:24:28 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.  This issue does not affect the versions of kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue does not affect the versions of qemu-kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   ``` |  |

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1066358#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-02-18 09:44:04 UTC  ``` Three issues were found:  * s->next_packet is read from wire as an index into s->rx[].  * s->tx_fifo_len is read from the wire and later used as an index into      s->tx_fifo[] when a DATA command is issued by the guest.  * s->tx_frame_len is read from the wire and can later used as an index      into s->tx_fifo[] for memset() when a DATA command is issued by the      guest.  An user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use this flaw to to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.  References: <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-12/msg00403.html> <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-12/msg00414.html> <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-12/msg00404.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1066358#c1)  Petr Matousek    2014-02-18 11:24:28 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=864797#c0)  Victor Pereira   2014-02-20 08:52:14 UTC  ``` CVE-2013-4532  Three issues were found:  * s->next_packet is read from wire as an index into s->rx[].  * s->tx_fifo_len is read from the wire and later used as an index into      s->tx_fifo[] when a DATA command is issued by the guest.  * s->tx_frame_len is read from the wire and can later used as an index      into s->tx_fifo[] for memset() when a DATA command is issued by the      guest.  An user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use this flaw to to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.

These are all about the same thing, with references to 23 patches
from the same thread starting there:

 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-12/msg00394.html>

It is about state loading issues, which is about migration between
two (hopefully) qemu instances or guest save/load functionality.
The first message in the series explains conditions when this can
happen.

In particular, this conclusion:

 Considering the preconditions, I think that the impact on typical
 qemu usage is low.  Still, I think these patches make sense for
 qemu-stable.

So it has even been questioned whenever those fixes are good for
the next qemu stable release or not.

But now I'm not really sure what to do with this bugreport.  It
is a good amount of work, especially to backport those to wheezy
(since code changed significantly since that), with quite low
outcome (because the whole thing does not seem very important,
even for qemu developers - note that this patchset hasn't been
applied still, which might be due to another issue in qemu
community).

So.. oh well.  I'd really love to not backport all this shit to
wheezy... ;)

Thanks,

/mjt

I had missed the initial mail from the thread, that explains it well
enough. I agree that the attack scenario during migration between
nodes is negligable and a non-issue.

But I don't understand what is meant by the second part:

| * Saving/Loading state to/from file.
| For example:
| <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=588133#c8>

The RH bugs are restricted and I don't understand what is meant with
"saving/loading state to/from file". Is this about snapshots or
malformed images? Do you have an idea?

> So.. oh well.  I'd really love to not backport all this shit to

If "Saving/Loading state to/from file" is negligable as well,
I would mark it as a non-issue in the tracker.

Feel free to downgrade to non-RC severity until the patches
are merged in 1.8.

It isn't exactly a non-issue really, or else it'd not be necessary to
assign (multiple) CVE IDs.  Even with migration scenario there are
possibilities to exploit these by using one of these vulnerabilities
together with some other vulnerability (and this is mentioned in
the first email in that thread).  Impact is quite low still.

It is like snapshots, yes.  One can save a guest memory image into
a file and load it later.  It is pretty much like migration (and
implemented using the same mechanism), but with a delay between
saving and loading.

One of the bugs mentioned above is about giving developer such a
saved file from local qemu asking for help in diagnosing an apparent
bug, and that image will try to exploit developer's qemu by using
one of these flaws.  Something like that anyway -- see
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-12/msg00612.html>

Another possible scenario is someone distributing virtual machines
for end-users, trying to exploit their qemu.

Unlike for, say, gif images or word documents or whatever, qemu
guest image _may_ come in one of 2 forms: it is just the drive
image (content of virtual hard drive), which you run and it boots
from the beginning as your regular PC will do.  Or this drive
image coupled with memory image, so when you run it, your system
is in some non-initial runtime state.  It is definitely unusual
to distribute something in the second form, together with the
memory state.

So I can imagine someone selling pre-loaded virtual machines
(doing it this way, together with memory state, is rare but can
have its reasons too, say, for a system which require significant
boot time).  Or, for example, your qemu/kvm hosting provider can
have a function to transfer whole your virtual machine (together
with the memory state) to you - either in terms of files like
that, or using online migration.

When you perform save/load locally in your usual environment where
you run qemu, you don't let stranger to modify the memory state
files created by qemu.  So locally this is not exploitable (unless
you use already hacked/modified qemu to create the images in the
first place, but that's obviously not very interesting case).

Both ways to "use" one of these vulns are real, but both are quite
difficult to use, hence the probably-low-impact.

Basically we've two possible ways to use these vulns.

First is to "spread" a break-in to other machines by, after breaking
into one machine (using some other way) and hacking qemu on it, it
becomes possible to break into qemu on the receiving-migration machine.

And second is when someone gives whole guest image (together with the
memory state) to you, tricking you to run it one way or another.

That's what issues are all about.  Not very serious, but not a non-issue
either.

Note that, while many people has been involved in code audit and
patching, the series received quite good criticism from Peter
Maydell who offerent alternative ways to fix some of the issues
or questioned validity of the proposed fixes, with not much
discussion following.

I'll ping this thread again - it's not nice when such a large
and good work is being thrown away.

BTW, next version of qemu will most likely be 2.0.  Without any
good reason for that :)

Thanks,

Thanks for the verbose explanation. Since both attacks as rather far-fetched,
I'll mark these as <no-dsa> in the security tracker. So we don't need a
Wheezy backport through security.debian.org

# USN-2342-1: QEMU vulnerabilities

8 September 2014

Several security issues were fixed in QEMU.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [qemu](/security/cves?package=qemu) - Machine emulator and virtualizer
* [qemu-kvm](/security/cves?package=qemu-kvm) - Machine emulator and virtualizer

## Details

Michael S. Tsirkin, Anthony Liguori, and Michael Roth discovered multiple

issues with QEMU state loading after migration. An attacker able to modify

the state data could use these issues to cause a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-4148](/security/CVE-2013-4148), [CVE-2013-4149](/security/CVE-2013-4149),

[CVE-2013-4150](/security/CVE-2013-4150), [CVE-2013-4151](/security/CVE-2013-4151), [CVE-2013-4526](/security/CVE-2013-4526), [CVE-2013-4527](/security/CVE-2013-4527), [CVE-2013-4529](/security/CVE-2013-4529),

[CVE-2013-4540](/security/CVE-2013-4540), [CVE-2013-4541](/security/CVE-2013-4541), [CVE-2013-4542](/security/CVE-2013-4542), [CVE-2013-6399](/security/CVE-2013-6399), [CVE-2014-0182](/security/CVE-2014-0182),

[CVE-2014-3461](/security/CVE-2014-3461))

Kevin Wolf, Stefan Hajnoczi, Fam Zheng, Jeff Cody, Stefan Hajnoczi, and

others discovered multiple issues in the QEMU block drivers. An attacker

able to modify disk images could use these issues to cause a denial of

service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-0142](/security/CVE-2014-0142), [CVE-2014-0143](/security/CVE-2014-0143),

[CVE-2014-0144](/security/CVE-2014-0144), [CVE-2014-0145](/security/CVE-2014-0145), [CVE-2014-0146](/security/CVE-2014-0146), [CVE-2014-0147](/security/CVE-2014-0147), [CVE-2014-0222](/security/CVE-2014-0222),

[CVE-2014-0223](/security/CVE-2014-0223))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain PCIe bus hotplug

operations. A malicious guest could use this issue to crash the QEMU host,

resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3471](/security/CVE-2014-3471))
