## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's fib6 error-code encoding for

IPv6. A local user with the CAT\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-6431](/security/CVE-2013-6431))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-34-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.8.0-34.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.8.0-34.49)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1490)

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way IP packets with an Internet Header Length

(ihl) of zero were processed in the skb\_flow\_dissect() function in the
Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger an infinite
loop in the kernel, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4348,
Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-4387, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the creation of

temporary IPv6 addresses. If the IPv6 privacy extension was enabled
(/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use\_tempaddr set to '2'), an attacker on
the local network could disable IPv6 temporary address generation, leading
to a potential information disclosure. (CVE-2013-0343, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled HID (Human Interface

Device) reports with an out-of-bounds Report ID. An attacker with physical
access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888,
Moderate)

* Heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the

Pantherlord/GreenAsia game controller driver, the Logitech force feedback
drivers, and the Logitech Unifying receivers driver handled HID reports.
An attacker with physical access to the system could use these flaws to
crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-2892, CVE-2013-2893, CVE-2013-2895, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the N-Trig touch

screen driver handled HID reports. An attacker with physical access to the
system could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2013-2896, Moderate)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's device

mapper subsystem, under certain conditions, interpreted data written to
snapshot block devices. An attacker could use this flaw to read data from
disk blocks in free space, which are normally inaccessible. (CVE-2013-4299,
Moderate)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the tun\_set\_iff() function in the

Universal TUN/TAP device driver implementation in the Linux kernel.
A privileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
further escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4343, Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in

the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead
to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected
when ANSI CPRNG was used. (CVE-2013-4345, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 SCTP implementation

interacted with the IPsec subsystem. This resulted in unencrypted SCTP
packets being sent over the network even though IPsec encryption was
enabled. An attacker able to inspect these SCTP packets could use this flaw
to obtain potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-4350, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Fujitsu for reporting CVE-2013-4299 and Stephan
Mueller for reporting CVE-2013-4345. The CVE-2013-4348 issue was discovered
by Jason Wang of Red Hat.

Bug fix:

* RoCE appeared to be supported in the MRG Realtime kernel even when the

required user space packages from the HPN channel were not installed.
The Realtime kernel now checks for the HPN channel packages before exposing
the RoCE interfaces. RoCE devices appear as plain 10GigE devices if the
needed HPN channel user space packages are not installed. (BZ#1012993)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
kernel to version kernel-rt-3.8.13-rt14, and correct these issues.
The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-235-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-235.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-235.51)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-43-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-43.66~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-43.66~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-57-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-57.87](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-57.87)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Alan Chester reported an issue with IPv6 on SCTP that IPsec traffic is not
being encrypted, whereas on IPv4 it is. Setting up an AH + ESP transport
does not seem to have the desired effect:

SCTP + IPv4:

  22:14:20.809645 IP (tos 0x2,ECT(0), ttl 64, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto AH (51), length 116)
    192.168.0.2 > 192.168.0.5: AH(spi=0x00000042,sumlen=16,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00000044,seq=0x1), length 72
  22:14:20.813270 IP (tos 0x2,ECT(0), ttl 64, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto AH (51), length 340)
    192.168.0.5 > 192.168.0.2: AH(spi=0x00000043,sumlen=16,seq=0x1):

SCTP + IPv6:

  22:31:19.215029 IP6 (class 0x02, hlim 64, next-header SCTP (132) payload length: 364)
    fe80::222:15ff:fe87:7fc.3333 > fe80::92e6:baff:fe0d:5a54.36767: sctp
    1) [INIT ACK] [init tag: 747759530] [rwnd: 62464] [OS: 10] [MIS: 10]

Moreover, Alan says:

  This problem was seen with both Racoon and Racoon2. Other people have seen
  this with OpenSwan. When IPsec is configured to encrypt all upper layer
  protocols the SCTP connection does not initialize. After using Wireshark to
  follow packets, this is because the SCTP packet leaves Box A unencrypted and
  Box B believes all upper layer protocols are to be encrypted so it drops
  this packet, causing the SCTP connection to fail to initialize. When IPsec
  is configured to encrypt just SCTP, the SCTP packets are observed unencrypted.

In fact, using `socat sctp6-listen:3333 -` on one end and transferring "plaintext"
string on the other end, results in cleartext on the wire where SCTP eventually
does not report any errors, thus in the latter case that Alan reports, the
non-paranoid user might think he's communicating over an encrypted transport on
SCTP although he's not (tcpdump ... -X):

  ...
  0x0030: 5d70 8e1a 0003 001a 177d eb6c 0000 0000  ]p.......}.l....
  0x0040: 0000 0000 706c 6169 6e74 6578 740a 0000  ....plaintext...

Only in /proc/net/xfrm_stat we can see XfrmInTmplMismatch increasing on the
receiver side. Initial follow-up analysis from Alan's bug report was done by
Alexey Dobriyan. Also thanks to Vlad Yasevich for feedback on this.

SCTP has its own implementation of sctp_v6_xmit() not calling inet6_csk_xmit().
This has the implication that it probably never really got updated along with
changes in inet6_csk_xmit() and therefore does not seem to invoke xfrm handlers.

SCTP's IPv4 xmit however, properly calls ip_queue_xmit() to do the work. Since
a call to inet6_csk_xmit() would solve this problem, but result in unecessary
route lookups, let us just use the cached flowi6 instead that we got through
sctp_v6_get_dst(). Since all SCTP packets are being sent through sctp_packet_transmit(),
we do the route lookup / flow caching in sctp_transport_route(), hold it in
tp->dst and skb_dst_set() right after that. If we would alter fl6->daddr in
sctp_v6_xmit() to np->opt->srcrt, we possibly could run into the same effect
of not having xfrm layer pick it up, hence, use fl6_update_dst() in sctp_v6_get_dst()
instead to get the correct source routed dst entry, which we assign to the skb.

Also source address routing example from [6250341](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/625034113bd45c71fb9e329f52f25fef9e6993a3) ("sctp: fix sctp to work with
ipv6 source address routing") still works with this patch! Nevertheless, in RFC5095
it is actually 'recommended' to not use that anyway due to traffic amplification [1].
So it seems we're not supposed to do that anyway in sctp_v6_xmit(). Moreover, if
we overwrite the flow destination here, the lower IPv6 layer will be unable to
put the correct destination address into IP header, as routing header is added in
ipv6_push_nfrag_opts() but then probably with wrong final destination. Things aside,
result of this patch is that we do not have any XfrmInTmplMismatch increase plus on
the wire with this patch it now looks like:

SCTP + IPv6:

  08:17:47.074080 IP6 2620:52:0:102f:7a2b:cbff:fe27:1b0a > 2620:52:0:102f:213:72ff:fe32:7eba:
    AH(spi=0x00005fb4,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00005fb5,seq=0x1), length 72
  08:17:47.074264 IP6 2620:52:0:102f:213:72ff:fe32:7eba > 2620:52:0:102f:7a2b:cbff:fe27:1b0a:
    AH(spi=0x00003d54,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00003d55,seq=0x1), length 296

This fixes Kernel Bugzilla 24412. This security issue seems to be present since
2.6.18 kernels. Lets just hope some big passive adversary in the wild didn't have
its fun with that. lksctp-tools IPv6 regression test suite passes as well with
this patch.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-235-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-235.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-235.51)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-2041-1: Linux kernel (Raring HWE) vulnerabilities

3 December 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-raring](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-raring) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Raring

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's fib6 error-code encoding for

IPv6. A local user with the CAT\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-6431](/security/CVE-2013-6431))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-34-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-34.49~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-34.49~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1441-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1441.60](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1441.60)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router

Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](/security/CVE-2013-0343))

Dan Carpenter discovered an information leak in the HP Smart Array and

Compaq SMART2 disk-array driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-2147](/security/CVE-2013-2147))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory

corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report

ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](/security/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

when CONFIG\_HID\_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could

leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2889](/security/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG\_HID\_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds

write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](/security/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG\_LOGITECH\_FF,

CONFIG\_LOGIG940\_FF, or CONFIG\_LOGIWHEELS\_FF are enabled. A physcially

proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias

a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](/security/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_LOGITECH\_DJ is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or

obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted

device. ([CVE-2013-2895](/security/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface

Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](/security/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)

subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG\_HID\_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A

physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of

service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](/security/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem

of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG\_HID\_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically

proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](/security/CVE-2013-2899))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](/security/CVE-2013-4470))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-236-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-236.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-236.52)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Miroslav Vadkerti discovered a flaw in how the permissions for network

sysctls are handled in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to have privileged access to files in /proc/sys/net/.

([CVE-2013-4270](/security/CVE-2013-4270))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

Wannes Rombouts reported a vulnerability in the networking tuntap interface

of the Linux kernel. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could

leverage this flaw to gain full admin privileges. ([CVE-2013-4343](/security/CVE-2013-4343))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission

Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.

([CVE-2013-4350](/security/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](/security/CVE-2013-4387))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](/security/CVE-2013-4470))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's fib6 error-code encoding for

IPv6. A local user with the CAT\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-6431](/security/CVE-2013-6431))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.11.0-14-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-14.21](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-14.21)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-14-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-14.21](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-14.21)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
