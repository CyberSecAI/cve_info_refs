{
  "CVE-2013-4350": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IPv6 SCTP implementation interacted with the IPsec subsystem. This resulted in unencrypted SCTP packets being sent over the network even though IPsec encryption was enabled. An attacker able to inspect these SCTP packets could use this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information.",
    "Root cause": "The SCTP implementation for IPv6 does not properly call the IPsec xfrm handlers, leading to unencrypted packets when IPsec is enabled.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of IPsec encryption for SCTP over IPv6",
      "Failure to invoke xfrm handlers in SCTP IPv6 xmit function",
        "Incorrect handling of cached flowi6 data"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of sensitive information transmitted over SCTP due to lack of encryption.",
    "Attack vector": "Remote attacker sniffing network traffic.",
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to observe network traffic between two systems using SCTP over IPv6 with IPsec enabled."
    }
