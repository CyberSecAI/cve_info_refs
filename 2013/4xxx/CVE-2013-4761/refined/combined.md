## Synopsis

Moderate: puppet security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1283)

## Topic

Updated puppet packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Puppet allows provisioning, patching, and configuration of clients to be
managed and automated.

A flaw was found in the way Puppet handled YAML content during
Representational State Transfer (REST) API calls. An attacker could
construct a request containing a crafted YAML payload that would cause the
Puppet master to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-3567)

It was found that resource\_type requests could be used to cause the Puppet
master to load and run Ruby files from anywhere on the file system. In
non-default configurations, a local user on the Puppet master server could
use this flaw to have arbitrary Ruby code executed with the privileges of
the Puppet master. (CVE-2013-4761)

It was found that Puppet Module Tool (that is, running "puppet module"
commands from the command line) applied incorrect permissions to installed
modules. If a malicious, local user had write access to the Puppet module
directory, they could use this flaw to modify the modules and therefore
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Puppet master.
(CVE-2013-4956)

Red Hat would like to thank Puppet Labs for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Ben Murphy as the original reporter of CVE-2013-3567.

Note: OpenStack uses these puppet packages with PackStack, a command line
utility that uses Puppet modules to support rapid deployment of OpenStack
on existing servers over an SSH connection. The Puppet master is not used
in this configuration, and as such, CVE-2013-3567 and CVE-2013-4761 are not
exploitable in this OpenStack use case.

Users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1284)

## Topic

Updated ruby193-puppet packages that fix three security issues are now
available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Puppet allows provisioning, patching, and configuration of clients to be
managed and automated.

A flaw was found in the way Puppet handled YAML content during
Representational State Transfer (REST) API calls. An attacker could
construct a request containing a crafted YAML payload that would cause the
Puppet master to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-3567)

It was found that resource\_type requests could be used to cause the Puppet
master to load and run Ruby files from anywhere on the file system. In
non-default configurations, a local user on the Puppet master server could
use this flaw to have arbitrary Ruby code executed with the privileges of
the Puppet master. (CVE-2013-4761)

It was found that Puppet Module Tool (that is, running "puppet module"
commands from the command line) applied incorrect permissions to installed
modules. If a malicious, local user had write access to the Puppet module
directory, they could use this flaw to modify the modules and therefore
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Puppet master.
(CVE-2013-4956)

Red Hat would like to thank Puppet Labs for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Ben Murphy as the original reporter of CVE-2013-3567.

These ruby193-puppet packages are used by Foreman, which provides
facilities for rapidly deploying Red Hat OpenStack 3.0. In this use case,
Puppet master is used and exposed to these issues. Note that Foreman is
provided as a Technology Preview. For more information on the scope and
nature of support for items marked as Technology Preview, refer to
<https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/>

Users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2761-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                          Raphael Geissert
September 19, 2013                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : puppet
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4761 CVE-2013-4956

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in puppet, a centralized
configuration management system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-4761

    The 'resource_type' service (disabled by default) could be used to
    make puppet load arbitrary Ruby code from puppet master's file
    system.

CVE-2013-4956

    Modules installed with the Puppet Module Tool might be installed
    with weak permissions, possibly allowing local users to read or
    modify them.

The stable distribution (wheezy) has been updated to version 2.7.33 of
puppet. This version includes the patches for all the previous DSAs
related to puppet in wheezy. In this version, the puppet report format
is now correctly reported as version 3.

It is to be expected that future DSAs for puppet update to a newer,
bug fix-only, release of the 2.7 branch.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) has not been updated for this
advisory: as of this time there is no fix for CVE-2013-4761 and the
package is not affected by CVE-2013-4956.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.23-1~deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 3.2.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>
