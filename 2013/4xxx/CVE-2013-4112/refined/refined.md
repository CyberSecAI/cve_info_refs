    "cveID": "CVE-2013-4112",
    "description": "A flaw was found in JGroup's DiagnosticsHandler that allowed an attacker on an adjacent network to reuse the credentials from a previous successful authentication. This could be exploited to read diagnostic information (information disclosure) and attain limited remote code execution.",
