| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=995975#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-08-12 06:05:29 UTC  ``` Pedro Ribeiro discovered a use-after-free flaw in the t2p_readwrite_pdf_image() function in tiff2pdf, a tool for converting a TIFF image to a PDF document. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when processed by tiff2pdf, would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running tiff2pdf.

It would be even more helpful if you would include the file or list of files since, with CVS, there's no quick way to find that information.  Yes, you can grep for the commitid in the logs, but it's not like git, svn, or any other modern VCS where a changeset is a first-class object.  Thanks!  (I maintain tiff for debian and admit to often benefiting from the excellent work of RedHat people on identifying, patching, and backporting security issues.)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=995975#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-27 18:34:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0223 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0223.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=995975#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-27 18:35:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0222 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0222.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=995975#c15)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-27 19:27:06 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=995965#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-08-12 05:15:22 UTC  ``` Pedro Ribeiro discovered a buffer overflow flaw in rgb2ycbcr, a tool to convert RGB color, greyscale, or bi-level TIFF images to YCbCr images, and multiple buffer overflow flaws in gif2tiff, a tool to convert GIF images to TIFF. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF or GIF file that, when processed by rgb2ycbcr and gif2tiff respectively, would cause the tool to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the tool.  References:  <http://www.asmail.be/msg0055359936.html> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/08/08/6>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=995965#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-08-13 05:41:45 UTC  ``` Analysis:  This flaw bug consists of 4 buffer-overflow flaws: (more details at <http://www.asmail.be/msg0055359936.html>)  Issue #1:  > File: tiff-4.0.3/tools/gif2tiff.c > Line: 316 > Code snippet: > void > readextension(void) > { >    int count; >    char buf[255];  >    (void) getc(infile); >    while ((count = getc(infile))) >        fread(buf, 1, count, infile); >} >Justification: > buffer is 256 bytes, but uses getc to get user input. Easy to exploit.  This really seems to be a non-issue. "count = getc(infile)" causes 1 byte to be read from the stream. getc() man pages suggest that "returns it as an unsigned char cast to an int, or EOF on end of file or error". So the output is really just 1 byte, but its cast to an int. (The int cast was chosen by glibc so that you can distinguish between EOF and the character with the same value as EOF)  So the max value of count = 255 bytes which are subsequently read into the 255 byte buffer. So no overflow here.  Issue #2:  > File: tiff-4.0.3/tools/gif2tiff.c > Line: 343-344 > Code snippet: >    unsigned char buf[255]; >    register int bits=0; >    register unsigned long datum=0; >    register unsigned char *ch; >    register int count, code; >    int status = 1;  >    datasize = getc(infile); >    clear = 1 << datasize; >    eoi = clear + 1; >    avail = clear + 2; >    oldcode = -1; >    codesize = datasize + 1; >    codemask = (1 << codesize) - 1; >    for (code = 0; code < clear; code++) { > prefix[code] = 0; > suffix[code] = code; > Justification: > buf is 255 but datasize is read from file input. If a crafted file provides > a datasize of 22, clear will be 4194304 (1 << 22). This means that a big > chunk of memory will become corrupted.  This seems to be a real issue. Upstream bug: <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2450> Proposed patch: <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/attachment.cgi?id=514&action=diff>  Issue #3:  > File: tiff-4.0.3/tools/gif2tiff.c > Line: 348 > Code snippet: >     for (count = getc(infile); count > 0; count = getc(infile)) { > fread(buf,1,count,infile); > Justification: > buf is 255 but function reads count and input from user. Easy to exploit.  Again a non-issue, explanation similar to Issue #1  Issue #4:  > File: tiff-4.0.3/tools/rgb2ycbcr.c > Line: 335 > Code snippet: > { char buf[2048]; >  char *cp = strrchr(TIFFFileName(in), '/'); >  sprintf(buf, "YCbCr conversion of %s", cp ? cp+1 : TIFFFileName(in)); >  TIFFSetField(out, TIFFTAG_IMAGEDESCRIPTION, buf); > } > Justification: > Use of sprintf to write into a 2048 character buffer. The input is the > filename, which might be over 2048 if crafted by a malicious user. However > I could not determine this as the code is not easy to navigate.  This issue is already fixed in upstream libtiff, when [CVE-2013-1961](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1961) was addressed.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0223)

## Topic

Updated libtiff packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
Image File Format (TIFF) files.

A heap-based buffer overflow and a use-after-free flaw were found in the
tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially
crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-1960, CVE-2013-4232)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker
could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could
cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2013-4231, CVE-2013-4243, CVE-2013-4244)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker
could use these flaws to create a specially crafted TIFF file that would
cause tiff2pdf to crash. (CVE-2013-1961)

Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NCI Agency for reporting
CVE-2013-1960 and CVE-2013-1961. The CVE-2013-4243 issue was discovered by
Murray McAllister of the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the
CVE-2013-4244 issue was discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

All libtiff users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications linked against libtiff must be restarted for this update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=995965#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-08-12 05:15:22 UTC  ``` Pedro Ribeiro discovered a buffer overflow flaw in rgb2ycbcr, a tool to convert RGB color, greyscale, or bi-level TIFF images to YCbCr images, and multiple buffer overflow flaws in gif2tiff, a tool to convert GIF images to TIFF. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF or GIF file that, when processed by rgb2ycbcr and gif2tiff respectively, would cause the tool to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the tool.  References:  <http://www.asmail.be/msg0055359936.html> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/08/08/6>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=995965#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-08-13 05:41:45 UTC  ``` Analysis:  This flaw bug consists of 4 buffer-overflow flaws: (more details at <http://www.asmail.be/msg0055359936.html>)  Issue #1:  > File: tiff-4.0.3/tools/gif2tiff.c > Line: 316 > Code snippet: > void > readextension(void) > { >    int count; >    char buf[255];  >    (void) getc(infile); >    while ((count = getc(infile))) >        fread(buf, 1, count, infile); >} >Justification: > buffer is 256 bytes, but uses getc to get user input. Easy to exploit.  This really seems to be a non-issue. "count = getc(infile)" causes 1 byte to be read from the stream. getc() man pages suggest that "returns it as an unsigned char cast to an int, or EOF on end of file or error". So the output is really just 1 byte, but its cast to an int. (The int cast was chosen by glibc so that you can distinguish between EOF and the character with the same value as EOF)  So the max value of count = 255 bytes which are subsequently read into the 255 byte buffer. So no overflow here.  Issue #2:  > File: tiff-4.0.3/tools/gif2tiff.c > Line: 343-344 > Code snippet: >    unsigned char buf[255]; >    register int bits=0; >    register unsigned long datum=0; >    register unsigned char *ch; >    register int count, code; >    int status = 1;  >    datasize = getc(infile); >    clear = 1 << datasize; >    eoi = clear + 1; >    avail = clear + 2; >    oldcode = -1; >    codesize = datasize + 1; >    codemask = (1 << codesize) - 1; >    for (code = 0; code < clear; code++) { > prefix[code] = 0; > suffix[code] = code; > Justification: > buf is 255 but datasize is read from file input. If a crafted file provides > a datasize of 22, clear will be 4194304 (1 << 22). This means that a big > chunk of memory will become corrupted.  This seems to be a real issue. Upstream bug: <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2450> Proposed patch: <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/attachment.cgi?id=514&action=diff>  Issue #3:  > File: tiff-4.0.3/tools/gif2tiff.c > Line: 348 > Code snippet: >     for (count = getc(infile); count > 0; count = getc(infile)) { > fread(buf,1,count,infile); > Justification: > buf is 255 but function reads count and input from user. Easy to exploit.  Again a non-issue, explanation similar to Issue #1  Issue #4:  > File: tiff-4.0.3/tools/rgb2ycbcr.c > Line: 335 > Code snippet: > { char buf[2048]; >  char *cp = strrchr(TIFFFileName(in), '/'); >  sprintf(buf, "YCbCr conversion of %s", cp ? cp+1 : TIFFFileName(in)); >  TIFFSetField(out, TIFFTAG_IMAGEDESCRIPTION, buf); > } > Justification: > Use of sprintf to write into a 2048 character buffer.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
