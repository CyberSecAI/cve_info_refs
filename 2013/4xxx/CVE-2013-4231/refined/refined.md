{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The GIF LZW decoder in `gif2tiff` lacks proper validation of the `datasize` value read from the input file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "A missing check on the `datasize` value read from a crafted GIF file leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
      "The vulnerability exists in the `gif2tiff` tool's LZW decompression routine where the `datasize` variable, read from the GIF file, controls the size of the memory allocated and the number of iterations in a loop. If `datasize` is sufficiently large (e.g., 22), it results in allocating a huge chunk of memory and corrupting it with invalid data."
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted GIF file can cause `gif2tiff` to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the tool.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker provides a specially-crafted GIF file to the `gif2tiff` tool.",
       "The `gif2tiff` tool processes a malicious GIF file containing a large `datasize` value."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted GIF file to be processed by `gif2tiff`."
