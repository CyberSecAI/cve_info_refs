Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4285:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A Gentoo-specific patch for PAM S/Key failed to clear user-provided credentials from memory after authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to clear sensitive data (cleartext passwords) from memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** A local attacker with the ability to inspect memory could potentially gain access to plaintext credentials provided by users during authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Memory Inspection:** The attacker must be able to dump or inspect the memory of the system where PAM S/Key is used.
*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker must have privileged access to be able to perform memory inspection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be logged into the affected system.
*   The attacker must have sufficient privileges to perform memory dumps or inspection.
*   The attacker must target the system where the vulnerable PAM S/Key module is used for authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically related to a Gentoo patch and is not inherent in the original PAM S/Key module.
*   The provided Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201402-12) provides details about the affected package, versions, and remediation steps.
