  "CVE-2013-4113": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way PHP parsed deeply nested XML documents. If a PHP application used the xml_parse_into_struct() function to parse untrusted XML content, an attacker able to supply specially-crafted XML could use this flaw to crash the application or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the PHP interpreter.",
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow flaw in the way PHP parsed deeply nested XML documents using the xml_parse_into_struct() function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can crash the application or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the PHP interpreter.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By supplying a specially-crafted XML file to a PHP application that uses the xml_parse_into_struct() function."
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to supply a specially-crafted XML file to the vulnerable PHP application."
