Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The OCaml binding for the `xc_vcpu_getaffinity` function in Xen incorrectly frees the memory pointed to by `c_cpumap` *before* the `xc_vcpu_getaffinity` function uses it. This is followed by another free of the same memory after the function call, resulting in a double-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The memory pointed to by `c_cpumap` is freed before `xc_vcpu_getaffinity` uses it, leading to use of freed memory.
- **Double-free:** The memory pointed to by `c_cpumap` is freed twice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a multithreaded toolstack (written in OCaml) to crash by racing against itself.
- **Potential Code Execution:**  Depending on the memory allocator used, exploitation can lead to heap corruption which may, potentially, lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation requires triggering the vulnerable `xc_vcpu_getaffinity` function using a multithreaded toolstack written in OCaml, specifically those that use the OCaml bindings for Xen.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with a vulnerable OCaml-based Xen toolstack, and cause the execution of `xc_vcpu_getaffinity`.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the double free vulnerability by sending a crafted input to the hypervisor through the vulnerable toolstack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Xen versions 4.2 and later.
- The advisory mentions that systems using an OCaml-based toolstack, such as xapi, are vulnerable.
- The provided patch fixes the issue by removing the premature `free(c_cpumap);` line.
- Mitigation involves avoiding the use of `vcpu_getaffinity` or restricting access to toolstack functionality from untrusted users.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Coverity Scan and Matthew Daley.
