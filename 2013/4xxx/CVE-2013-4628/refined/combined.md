# Security Advisory-The Firewall Module of SPU Board Information Leakage Vulnerability of Huawei Campus Switch

* SA No:Huawei-SA-20130516-01-SPU
* Initial Release Date:
  May 16, 2013
* Last Release Date:
  Jul 19, 2013

Summary

The Service Process Unit (SPU) is the value-added service card of the Switch. SPU provides services such as load balancing, firewall, Network Address Translation (NAT), IP Security (IPSec), and NetStream. It mainly be deployed in network of carrier and enterprise customers, and provides network security solution and interconnection solution between campuses and private networks.

SPU contains a vulnerability that the users of low priority security zone may visit the contents located in high priority security zone, and it could cause information leakage. The vulnerability is due to improper handling process while the switch works in a specific working model (Vulnerability ID: HWNSIRT-2013-0317).

Currently, this vulnerability has been fixed in Quidway official release.

Affected Products

| Products Name | Products Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Quidway S7700 SPU | V200R001C00SPC300 V200R001C10SPC300 |
| Quidway S9300 SPU | V200R001C00SPC300 V200R001C10SPC300 |
| Quidway S9700 SPU | V200R001C00SPC300 V200R001C10SPC300 |

Impact

By exploiting the vulnerability successfully, it may lead to the user in low priority security zone of switch could access to the data existed in high priority security zone, and it causes information leakage.

Vulnerability Scoring Details

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSSv2 scoring system (<http://www.first.org/cvss/>).

The score of the vulnerability is following:

Base Score: 4.9(AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P)

Temporal Score: 4.1 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)

Overall Score: 4.1

Technique Details

Vulnerability exploitation prerequisites:

1. The attacker is a legal user of the security zone in switch,

2. The switch works in the specific model and runs with default configuration between different security zones.

Vulnerability details:

The user in the low priority security zone visits the data located in the high priority security zone.

Temporary Fix

To prevent the information leakage occurring, modify the default packet filter policy between the security zones. Please refer to the Configuration Guide for detailed info. Below is a configuration example:

1, Configure ACL rules:

[SPU]acl number 2000

[SPU-acl-basic-2000]rule 10 deny

[SPU-acl-basic-2000]quit

2, Apply ACL rules. We assume that the security zones named “trust” and “untrust” are pre-configured in the switch according to users accessing privilege:

[SPU]firewall interzone trust untrust

[SPU-interzone-trust-untrust]firewall enable

[SPU-interzone-trust-untrust]packet-filter 2000 outbound

[SPU-interzone-trust-untrust]packet-filter 2000 inbound

[SPU-interzone-trust-untrust]quit

Software Versions and Fixes

Solution

Modify the default packet filter policy handling process between the security zones to prevent the information leakage vulnerability.

This vulnerability has been fixed in the following version:

| Products Name | Products Version | SPU Patches Version | Release Data |
