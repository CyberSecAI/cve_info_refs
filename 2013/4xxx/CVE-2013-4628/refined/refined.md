Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper handling process within the firewall module of the Service Process Unit (SPU) board when the Huawei campus switch operates in a specific working model. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the switch's failure to properly enforce access control between different security zones, especially when using the default configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the ability of users in a low-priority security zone to access data located in a high-priority security zone. This circumvents the intended security segmentation.
* **Improper Access Control:**  The core issue is a flaw in how the SPU's firewall module handles packet filtering and interzone communication when using its default configurations. This allows for unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker in a low-priority security zone to gain access to and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information from a high-priority security zone.
* **Potential for Further Compromise:** While the document only explicitly mentions information leakage, unauthorized access could be a stepping stone for more serious attacks, if more vulnerabilities are discovered in the future.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network access. Attackers must have some form of access to the network segment within which the affected switch is deployed.
* **Inter-Security Zone Communication:** The vulnerability is triggered when traffic crosses security zone boundaries, exposing traffic to potential access control flaws.
* **Default Configurations:**  The vulnerability is easier to exploit when default configurations are used for security zones.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Legitimate User Access:** The attacker must be a valid user of at least one security zone on the affected switch. They don't need administrative privileges, but only regular access to the "low priority zone".
* **Network Access to Affected Switch:** The attacker must be able to send packets through the switch. The attack can be done from inside or outside of the "trust" zone, so no specific network position is needed, aside from being able to send packets to the switch.
* **Knowledge of Target Location:** The attacker will need to know that there is information to be leaked in a "high-priority" zone, but they don't need to know details about the contents.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported internally by Huawei, and it is mentioned that there are no reports of exploitation.
*   The document provides a temporary fix involving Access Control Lists (ACLs) to block communication between the zones until the device is upgraded.
*   The fix involves modification of the default packet filter policy.
*   The document provides a list of the affected products, software versions, and the patched versions.
