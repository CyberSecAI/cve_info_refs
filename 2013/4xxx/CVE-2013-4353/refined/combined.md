| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-06 21:53:58 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS handshakes.  A carefully crafted invalid TLS handshake could crash OpenSSL with a NULL pointer exception.  This flaw only affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1e; earlier versions are not affected and this is corrected in upstream version 1.0.1f [1],[2].  [1] <http://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2013-4353> [2] <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=197e0ea817ad64820789d86711d55ff50d71f631>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-06 22:03:06 UTC  ```  Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1049061](show_bug.cgi?id=1049061 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4353 openssl: TLS record tampering issue can lead to OpenSSL crash [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-06 22:03:08 UTC  ```  Created mingw-openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1049062](show_bug.cgi?id=1049062 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4353 mingw-openssl: openssl: TLS record tampering issue can lead to OpenSSL crash [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-07 16:02:22 UTC  ``` This is a client side issue - an application using OpenSSL library to implement TLS/SSL client functionality can be crashed by malicious TLS/SSL server (or MITM attacker tampering with handshake packets) using this flaw.  Affected code was introduced when Next Protocol Negotiation support was added in version 1.0.1.  Relevant upstream commit:  <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ee2ffc2>  Therefore, only versions 1.0.1 are affected by this issue.  The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier are not affected (they are based on older 0.9.* versions).  The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 before 6.5 were also not affected, as they were based on upstream version 1.0.0.  They were updated to version 1.0.1e in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 via RHBA-2013:1585.  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-1585.html>  Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of openssl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-08 18:19:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0015 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0015.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c8)  Fedora Update System    2014-01-10 07:45:40 UTC  ``` openssl-1.0.1e-37.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c9)  Fedora Update System    2014-01-10 07:58:45 UTC  ``` openssl-1.0.1e-37.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c10)  Fedora Update System    2014-01-12 05:06:41 UTC  ``` openssl-1.0.1e-37.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-21 17:03:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2014:0041 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0041.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-17 12:27:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV Manager version 3.3  Via RHSA-2014:0416 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0416.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

## Details

Anton Johansson discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain invalid

TLS handshakes. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4353](/security/CVE-2013-4353))

Ron Barber discovered that OpenSSL used an incorrect data structure to

obtain a version number. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-6449](/security/CVE-2013-6449))

Dmitry Sobinov discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain DTLS

retransmissions. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-6450](/security/CVE-2013-6450))

This update also disables the default use of the RdRand feature of certain

Intel CPUs as the sole source of entropy.

# Splunk 6.0.3 addresses two vulnerabilities

**Advisory ID:** SP-CAAAMB3

**CVE ID:** [-](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=-)

**Published:** 2014-04-10

**Last Update:**

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** -,

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [-](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#-)

**CWE:** [-](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/.html)

**Bug ID:** -

## Description

Splunk version 6.0.3 addresses the following two vulnerabilities:

* OpenSSL 1.0.1 TLS Heartbeat leaks sensitive information (SPL-82696, CVE-2014-0160)
* Invalid TLS handshake could crash OpenSSL with a NULL pointer exception (SPL-78823, CVE-2013-4353)
* At the time of this announcement, Splunk is not aware of any cases where these vulnerabilities have been actively exploited. Previous Product Security Announcements can be found on our Splunk Product Security Portal. Use SPL numbers when referencing issues in communication with Splunk. If there is no CVE Identifier listed with a vulnerability, it will be added once it is assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority. To standardize the calculation of severity scores for each vulnerability, when appropriate, Splunk uses Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 2.

## Affected Products and Components

The security vulnerabilities addressed by this maintenance release affect indexers, search heads, forwarders, deployment servers, and license servers in the following versions:

* SPL-82696: Splunk 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2
* SPL-78823: Splunk 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2
  ## Mitigation and Upgrades

  To mitigate this issue, Splunk recommends upgrading to the latest release and applying as many of the Hardening Standards from the Securing Splunk documentation as are relevant to your environment. Splunk releases are cumulative, meaning that future releases will contain fixes to these vulnerabilities, new features and other bug fixes.

## Vulnerability Descriptions and Ratings

### OpenSSL 1.0.1 TLS Heartbeat leaks sensitive information (SPL-82696, CVE-2014-0160)

**Description**: The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to d1\_both.c and t1\_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug.

### CVSS Severity (version 2.0):

**CVSS Base Score 5.0**

CVSS Impact Subscore 2.9

CVSS Exploitability Subscore 10.0

**Overall CVSS Score 5.0**

### Invalid TLS handshake could crash OpenSSL with a NULL pointer exception (SPL-78823, CVE-2013-4353)

**Description**: The ssl3\_take\_mac function in ssl/s3\_both.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1f allows remote TLS servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted Next Protocol Negotiation record in a TLS handshake.

#### CVSS Severity (version 2.0):

**CVSS Base Score 4.3**

CVSS Impact Subscore 2.9

CVSS Exploitability Subscore 8.6

**Overall CVSS Score 4.3**

## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0015)

## Topic

Updated openssl packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL determined which hashing algorithm to
use when TLS protocol version 1.2 was enabled. This could possibly cause
OpenSSL to use an incorrect hashing algorithm, leading to a crash of an
application using the library. (CVE-2013-6449)

It was discovered that the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
protocol implementation in OpenSSL did not properly maintain encryption and
digest contexts during renegotiation. A lost or discarded renegotiation
handshake packet could cause a DTLS client or server using OpenSSL to
crash. (CVE-2013-6450)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled
TLS/SSL protocol handshake packets. A specially crafted handshake packet
could cause a TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2013-4353)

All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or
the system rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor6 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0041)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes multiple security issues is
now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

Upgrade Note: If you upgrade Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
6.4 to version 6.5 through the 3.3 Manager administration portal,
configuration of the previous system appears to be lost when reported in
the TUI. However, this is an issue in the TUI itself, not in the upgrade
process; the configuration of the system is not affected.

A flaw was found in the way NSS handled invalid handshake packets. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to cause a TLS/SSL client using NSS to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application. (CVE-2013-5605)

A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL determined which hashing algorithm to
use when TLS protocol version 1.2 was enabled. This could possibly cause
OpenSSL to use an incorrect hashing algorithm, leading to a crash of an
application using the library. (CVE-2013-6449)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled
TLS/SSL protocol handshake packets. A specially crafted handshake packet
could cause a TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2013-4353)

It was discovered that NSS did not reject certificates with incompatible
key usage constraints when validating them while the verifyLog feature was
enabled. An application using the NSS certificate validation API could
accept an invalid certificate. (CVE-2013-5606)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting
CVE-2013-5606. Upstream acknowledges Camilo Viecco as the original reporter
of CVE-2013-5606.

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

CVE-2013-6462 (libXfont issue)

CVE-2013-6629, and CVE-2013-6630 (libjpeg-turbo issues)

CVE-2013-1739, CVE-2013-1741, and CVE-2013-5607 (nss, nspr issues)

CVE-2013-6450 (openssl issue)

CVE-2013-6425 (pixman issue)

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Known issues

### Non APAR Defect 13042 - ISM agent doesn't start after upgrading Windows Box

**Problem Description**
  The Windows ISM agent is stopped after an upgrade.
 **Root cause**
  The installer does not support changes to define old and new agent registry keys.
 **Workaround**
  Reconfigure the ISM agent after the upgrade to resolve the problem.

### Non APAR Defect 10767 - ISM support file upgrades overwrites ismconfig.props

**Problem Description**
  ISM support files upgrades overwrite ismconfig.props. Note: ISM monitor props files are NOT overwritten.
 **Root cause**
  The installer does not support not overwriting ismconfig.props.
 **Workaround**
  Backup the ismconfig.props file before performing an upgrade of ISM support.

### Non APAR Defect 13701 - ismconfig.cmd fails to accept multiple white space enclosed in quotes(") in SOAP parameters

**Problem Description**
  ismconfig.cmd truncates multiple white spaces in SOAP parameters. For example the following SOAPInputs: @SOAPInputs [itinerary:{from:string,dest:string}[]=[{from='Perth,\" \",Australia',dest='Sydney'}]]"
 **Root cause**
  This problem is due to the command line interpretation of escaping the quotation character.
 **Workaround**
  Write command into a text file and use the ismconfig.cmd -file command to import the command(s).

### Non APAR Defect 14498 - Internet Service Monitor 7.3.0.1 upgrade fails with no existing image to upgrade error

**Problem Description**
  When upgrading the ISM the upgrade can fail with the following error:
 mkdir: 0653-357 Cannot access directory /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses.
 /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.
 cp: /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses/isv730: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.
 KCIIN2593E
 The CD you are trying to install is a fixpack CD and cannot be installed on a machine without an existing image to upgrade.
 **Root cause**
  The installation script expects the following directory to exist in the previous installation: $CANDLEHOME/licenses

 If this doesn't exists it cannot detect the previous ISM installation correctly causing the upgrade to stop.
 **Workaround**
  Create the $CANDLEHOME/licenses directory and re-run the installation.
 Refer to the [technote](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21618763) for more information.

## Known limitations

### Non APAR Defect 16289 - Remote Upgrade

**Problem Description**
  Remote upgrades using the tacmd updateAgent command on Linux x86\_64 fails. Please use a local installation for this Operating System.
### Change of Summarized Data

**Problem Description**
  After upgrading earlier versions of the ISM application, summarized data may not be visible, since the summarization behaviour has changed. This issue can be resolved by re-summarizing your existing detailed data. Please refer to this [technote](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21443517) for more information.
### SOAP Monitor Does Not Support Nested Arrays or multiRef Values

**Problem Description**
  The SOAP monitor is unable to handle parameters containing nested (two or more dimension) arrays or those that are referenced externally in the 'multiRef' style.
## Installation information

For AIX, if upgrading from an ISM 6.0.1 release, you must uninstall the product and perform a new install. This does not apply for other ISM 6 releases. For more information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21321186>

For Linux 64-bit, if upgrading from the original ISM 7.1.0.0 release with no fix packs applied, you must uninstall the 7.1.0.0 ISM component and perform a new install. This does not apply to other releases. For more detailed information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330976>

For Windows installation, if you encounter the message "Another version of this product is already installed" follow the instructions in the following support document to diagnose and resolve the problem. Note that although this technote refers to ITM, the diagnosing and resolving steps are applicable to ITCAM for Transactions Internet Service Monitoring. <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21587068>

## Prior to installation

The update installer should perform the following steps for you automatically. You can, if necessary, perform them manually.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).
2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS):
 The ITM agents and infrastructure only need to be stopped when either the application support packages are being installed or ISM is being installed on the ITM machine. If ISM is being installed on a machine that does not contain any ITM infrastructure, the ITM infrastructure does not need to be stopped.

Use the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) dialog or the command line tools (`ITM\bin\tacmd` or `ITM/bin/itmcmd`) to stop any running ITM agents or infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).

On Windows systems, you can start the MTEMS application from your Start menu or by running `ITM\InstallITM\kinconfg.exe`. Alternatively, if you have installed ITM, use the command `ITM\bin\tacmd stopAgent <type>`.

On UNIX systems, you can run MTEMS using the `ITM/bin/itmcmd manage` command. Alternatively, use the commands `ITM/bin/itmcmd agent stop <type>` and `ITM/bin/itmcmd server stop <TEMS name>`.

2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped:
 When the KISAgent is stopped, it automatically signals for the monitors and databridge to be shutdown. If this does not occur or has been disabled by configuration changes, you may need to perform this step manually.

On Windows systems use the Windows Services dialog to look for any 'NCO \* Internet Service Monitor' services. To stop the databrige and monitors ensure that each of these 'NCO \*' services are stopped.

On UNIX systems run `ps -ef |grep nco\_m\_` and issue a `kill <pid>` command for each entry shown. If the databridge or monitors were heavily loaded, they may take some time to shutdown. You may also use `kill -9 <pid>` to immediately stop the databridge or monitors, but this may result in loss or corruption of data being processed.

## Installing

This maintenance package is applied directly to the Tivoli Enterprise Management Agent (TEMA). In addition, apply application support from this interim fix to the following ITM components:

* - Tivoli Enterprise Management Servers (TEMS), including any remote or failover TEMS configurations
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), including any locally installed desktop TEP clients

On Windows systems, extract the files from the archive and double-click WINDOWS\setup.exe. Follow the prompts to install the update.

On UNIX systems, extract the installer from the archive using the **tar -xvf <filename.tar>** command. Then, execute the installer using the **./install.sh** command. Follow the prompts to install the update.

It is also possible to deploy this interim fix remotely using ITM TEMS depot and tacmd AddBundles command. For more information, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.3.0.1 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/rt/Install_Guide/remotedeploy.html>
 **Installing application support for TEPS/TEMS**
 For each monitoring agent installed, you must install agent-specific application support on IBM Tivoli Monitoring components. You can choose to install application support on all components at one time, or you can install the application support on components separately. If installing components separately, the following order is recommended:

1. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
2. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
3. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop Client
4. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server Browser client (for Linux and UNIX Only)

The procedure for installing agent-specific application support on the components is similar to installing the monitoring agent. The main difference is to select the application support components required.

 **Note:** When installing application support **any ITM components on the current machine is automatically stopped, including any TEMS or TEPS.** Follow the [Starting and stopping servers and agents](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/rt/Install_Guide/startstopagent.html) guide to manually stop ITM agents and infrastructure. You should warn other users before beginning the installation.

 For step by step application support installation information refer to the documentation:
 [Installing Internet Service Monitoring on Windows systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_win_itcamt.html)

## Performing the necessary tasks after installation

A successful installation modifies the ISM version to 7.3.0.1. Ensure that the Version of Internet Service Monitoring in the MTEMS is '07.30.01.29'.

On Windows the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM\InstallITM\

On Unix the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM/logs/

For Linux 64-bit, if upgrading from the original ISM 7.1.0.0 release with no fix packs applied, you must uninstall the 7.1.0.0 ISM component and perform a new install. This does not apply to other releases. For more detailed information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330976>

For Windows installation, if you encounter the message "Another version of this product is already installed" follow the instructions in the following support document to diagnose and resolve the problem. Note that although this technote refers to ITM, the diagnosing and resolving steps are applicable to ITCAM for Transactions Internet Service Monitoring. <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21587068>

## Prior to installation

The update installer should perform the following steps for you automatically. You can, if necessary, perform them manually.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).
2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS):
 The ITM agents and infrastructure only need to be stopped when either the application support packages are being installed or ISM is being installed on the ITM machine. If ISM is being installed on a machine that does not contain any ITM infrastructure, the ITM infrastructure does not need to be stopped.

Use the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) dialog or the command line tools (`ITM\bin\tacmd` or `ITM/bin/itmcmd`) to stop any running ITM agents or infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).

On Windows systems, you can start the MTEMS application from your Start menu or by running `ITM\InstallITM\kinconfg.exe`. Alternatively, if you have installed ITM, use the command `ITM\bin\tacmd stopAgent <type>`.

On UNIX systems, you can run MTEMS using the `ITM/bin/itmcmd manage` command. Alternatively, use the commands `ITM/bin/itmcmd agent stop <type>` and `ITM/bin/itmcmd server stop <TEMS name>`.

2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped:
 When the KISAgent is stopped, it automatically signals for the monitors and databridge to be shutdown. If this does not occur or has been disabled by configuration changes, you may need to perform this step manually.

On Windows systems use the Windows Services dialog to look for any 'NCO \* Internet Service Monitor' services. To stop the databrige and monitors ensure that each of these 'NCO \*' services are stopped.

On UNIX systems run `ps -ef |grep nco\_m\_` and issue a `kill <pid>` command for each entry shown. If the databridge or monitors were heavily loaded, they may take some time to shutdown. You may also use `kill -9 <pid>` to immediately stop the databridge or monitors, but this may result in loss or corruption of data being processed.

## Installing

This maintenance package is applied directly to the Tivoli Enterprise Management Agent (TEMA). In addition, apply application support from this interim fix to the following ITM components:

* - Tivoli Enterprise Management Servers (TEMS), including any remote or failover TEMS configurations
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), including any locally installed desktop TEP clients

On Windows systems, extract the files from the archive and double-click WINDOWS\setup.exe. Follow the prompts to install the update.

On UNIX systems, extract the installer from the archive using the **tar -xvf <filename.tar>** command. Then, execute the installer using the **./install.sh** command. Follow the prompts to install the update.

It is also possible to deploy this interim fix remotely using ITM TEMS depot and tacmd AddBundles command. For more information, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.4.0.0 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/rt/Install_Guide/remotedeploy.html>
 **Installing application support for TEPS/TEMS**
 For each monitoring agent installed, you must install agent-specific application support on IBM Tivoli Monitoring components. You can choose to install application support on all components at one time, or you can install the application support on components separately. If installing components separately, the following order is recommended:

1. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
2. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
3. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop Client
4. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server Browser client (for Linux and UNIX Only)

The procedure for installing agent-specific application support on the components is similar to installing the monitoring agent. The main difference is to select the application support components required.

 **Note:** When installing application support **any ITM components on the current machine is automatically stopped, including any TEMS or TEPS.** Follow the [Starting and stopping servers and agents](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/rt/Install_Guide/startstopagent.html) guide to manually stop ITM agents and infrastructure. You should warn other users before beginning the installation.

 For step by step application support installation information refer to the documentation:
 [Installing Internet Service Monitoring on Windows systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_win_itcamt.html)
 [Installing on Linux or UNIX systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_unix_itcam.html)

## Performing the necessary tasks after installation

A successful installation modifies the ISM version to 7.4.0.0. Ensure that the Version of Internet Service Monitoring in the MTEMS is '07.40.00.13'.

On Windows the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM\InstallITM\

On Unix the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM/logs/

## Troubleshooting installation problems from the Support site

For more detailed information, refer to the Installation and Configuration Guide: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/topic/ISM_install_chapter.html>

## Uninstalling if necessary

This maintenance package cannot be rolled back.

On Windows, you must run the following command prior to uninstalling the product to remove the Windows Services created during the install:
 ITM\TMAITM6\ism\platform\win32\bin\preuninstall.cmd
 The product may then be removed using the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs.

On UNIX,the product may be removed using the script:
 ITM/bin/uninstall.sh

For detailed instructions, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.4.0.0 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/topic/ISM_uninstall_chapter.html>

Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering
the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
a very fast network connection with low latency.

There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker
process must either be located in the same physical computer or must
have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason
the severity of this vulnerability is Low.

Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we’re aware of, either only “named
curves” are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can’t represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates. Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an “exotic”
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC\_GROUP\_new\_curve\_GF2m(), EC\_GROUP\_new\_from\_params(),
and various supporting BN\_GF2m\_\*() functions.

Applications working with “exotic” explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS
clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory
address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.

Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of
service.

Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
application program.

Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, …) is not
affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also
specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.

TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they
generally don’t perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected
identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the
certificate chain. So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity
of the issue is Moderate.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto with an
empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
be sent to the peer.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
that directly call the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function with a 0 length list of
supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
application.

The OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto is typically used by TLS
applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
widely deployed than NPN. The SSL\_select\_next\_proto function accepts a list of
protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL\_select\_next\_proto is
called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
that there was no overlap in the lists).

This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
SSL\_select\_next\_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
supplied by the client passed in the client/client\_len parameters), then the
application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client\_len
parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a “no overlap”
response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
will be vulnerable to this problem.

In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
However if the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function is accidentally called with a
client\_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
confidentiality will occur.

This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
exploitation unlikely.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available.

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_free\_buffers may cause
memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations

Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such
as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.
However, only applications that directly call the SSL\_free\_buffers function are
affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not
vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by
applications.

The SSL\_free\_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used
when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected
to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have
been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.

The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the
network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.
In this case calling SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though a record has only
been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.

The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has
been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of
this data. Again a call to SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though the buffer
is still in use.

While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a
malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.
We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very
slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check()
or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
Service.

The functions EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() perform
various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
the modulus size when performing the checks.

An application that calls EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the `-check` option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded
memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions

Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger
unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service

This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL\_OP\_NO\_TICKET option is
being used (but not if early\_data support is also configured and the default
anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the
session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly
as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A
malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to
force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.

This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS
clients.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL
1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL
to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
sources might terminate abruptly.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
be vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12\_parse(),
PKCS12\_unpack\_p7data(), PKCS12\_unpack\_p7encdata(), PKCS12\_unpack\_authsafes()
and PKCS12\_newpass().

We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME\_write\_PKCS7(). However since this
function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take
a long time.

Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that
is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead
to a Denial of Service.

When function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() is called on RSA public keys,
a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.
For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this
computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,
then this computation would take a long time.

An application that calls EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() and supplies an RSA key
obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack.

The function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() is not called from other OpenSSL
functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line
application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used
with the ‘-pubin’ and ‘-check’ options on untrusted data.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running
on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.

Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC
algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various
application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for
PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order
than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers
are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only
on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing
pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result
of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of
service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious
client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that
TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However
we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected
by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.

Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking
excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_generate\_key() to
generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications
that use DH\_check\_pub\_key(), DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.
Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from
an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

While DH\_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),
DH\_check\_pub\_key() doesn’t make any of these checks, and is therefore
vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.

Likewise, while DH\_generate\_key() performs a check for an excessively large
P, it doesn’t check for an excessively large Q.

An application that calls DH\_generate\_key() or DH\_check\_pub\_key() and
supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

DH\_generate\_key() and DH\_check\_pub\_key() are also called by a number of
other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other
functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this
are DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex(), EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check(), and EVP\_PKEY\_generate().

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the
“-pubcheck” option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and
initialisation vector (IV) lengths. This can lead to potential truncation
or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.

Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,
which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.

When calling EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() or
EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() the provided OSSL\_PARAM array is processed after
the key and IV have been established. Any alterations to the key length,
via the “keylen” parameter or the IV length, via the “ivlen” parameter,
within the OSSL\_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially
causing truncation or overreading of these values. The following ciphers
and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.

For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in
loss of confidentiality. For example, when following NIST’s SP 800-38D
section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in
GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.

Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
critical.

Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation
and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that
application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since
decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being
vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then
this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this
issue as Moderate severity overall.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because
the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.

OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on the
Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86\_64 processors supporting the
AVX512-IFMA instructions.

Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker
can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application
state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does
not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform
when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to
the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their
previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86\_64 processors
supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so
the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,
if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent
calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD
cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using
OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of
any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we
consider this a Low severity security issue.

As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at
runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL\_ia32cap:

OPENSSL\_ia32cap=:~0x200000

The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex()
or EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing
CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger
an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,
if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is
unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.

An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

The function DH\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex()
or EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained

The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those
checks confirms that the modulus (‘p’ parameter) is not too large. Trying to use
a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which
is over 10,000 bits in length.

However the DH\_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters
that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value
even if it has already been found to be too large.

An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.

Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes
it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as
a consequence.

Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to
authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be misled by removing,
adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL
implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications.

The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated
data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the
application has to call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP\_CipherUpdate()) with
NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.
The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call
instead of performing the associated data authentication operation.
The empty data thus will not be authenticated.

As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and
we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data
entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.

Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or
data containing them may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ\_obj2txt() directly, or use any of
the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message
size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those
messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.

An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -
most of which have no size limit. OBJ\_obj2txt() may be used to translate
an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL
type ASN1\_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the
sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by
periods.

When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large
(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds
of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long
time. The time complexity is O(n^2) with ’n’ being the size of the
sub-identifiers in bytes (\*).

With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /
identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT
IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching
algorithms.

Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure
AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify
what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or
decrypt, or digest passed data.

Applications that call OBJ\_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are
affected, with any version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose
of display, the severity is considered low.

In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,
CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts anything that processes X.509
certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.

The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a
100KiB limit on the peer’s certificate chain. Additionally, this only
impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client
authentication.

In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,
such as X.509 certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way
that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered
not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,
and the severity is therefore considered low.

Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM
platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,
leading to a crash.

Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM
platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually
used for disk encryption.

The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read
past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16
byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext
buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of
service.

If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer
being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the
application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue
a Low severity one.

The function X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy() is documented to
implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate
verification. However the implementation of the function does not
enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect
policies to pass the certificate verification.

As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was
decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy()
function.

Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate
policy check need to use X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set1\_policies() or explicitly
enable the policy check by calling X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set\_flags() with
the X509\_V\_FLAG\_POLICY\_CHECK flag argument.

Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not
commonly used by applications.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be
vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.

Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by
OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate.
A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies
in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions

of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains
that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this
vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers
exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service
(DoS) attack on affected systems.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the

A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being
verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash
algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but
the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest
initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return
value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid
usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.

The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS
enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading
the legacy provider.

PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the
time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does
not call these functions however third party applications would be
affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted
data.

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL\_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
the OpenSSL function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp as an ASN1\_TYPE rather than an
ASN1\_STRING.

When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
X509\_V\_FLAG\_CRL\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass
arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to
provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a
valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other
input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which
is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs
over a network.

application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the
EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() function. This will most likely lead
to an application crash. This function can be called on public

The public API function BIO\_new\_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming
ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the
SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by
end user applications.

The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\_f\_asn1 filter
BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of
the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS
recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function
returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain
is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains
internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on
to call BIO\_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most
likely result in a crash.

This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\_write\_ASN1() which
may cause BIO\_new\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\_pop() on
the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
PEM\_write\_bio\_ASN1\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_CMS\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_PKCS7\_stream,
SMIME\_write\_ASN1, SMIME\_write\_CMS and SMIME\_write\_PKCS7.

Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
i2d\_ASN1\_bio\_stream, BIO\_new\_CMS, BIO\_new\_PKCS7, i2d\_CMS\_bio\_stream and
i2d\_PKCS7\_bio\_stream.

The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.

The function PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and
decodes the “name” (e.g. “CERTIFICATE”), any header data and the payload data.
If the function succeeds then the “name\_out”, “header” and “data” arguments are
populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The
caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a
PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\_read\_bio\_ex()
will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer
to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer
then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This
could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM
files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.

The functions PEM\_read\_bio() and PEM\_read() are simple wrappers around
PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.

These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL
functions including PEM\_X509\_INFO\_read\_bio\_ex() and
SSL\_CTX\_use\_serverinfo\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal
uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the
header argument if PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations
include the PEM\_read\_bio\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in
OpenSSL 3.0.

The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.

A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation
which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a
Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker
would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for
decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,
RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.

For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an
encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a
genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a
sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master
secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the
application data sent over that connection.

A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs
after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a
CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path
to a trusted issuer.

The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to
a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure
of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext)
although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory
contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.

In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
client authentication and a malicious client connects.

If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and
policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice
recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this
results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy
processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered

A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.

This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() and EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID\_undef as this value in the call to EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new(). When NID\_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new() using NID\_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86\_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86\_64 architecture are affected by this issue.

AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasnât written. In the special case of âin placeâ encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.

In addition to the c\_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c\_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c\_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.

The OPENSSL\_LH\_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common.

The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP\_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP\_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL âocspâ application. When verifying an ocsp response with the â-no\_cert\_checksâ option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result.

The BN\_mod\_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN\_mod\_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022.

There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021, and the release of 1.0.2zc on the 22nd of February 2022. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms.

Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509\_verify\_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL\_connect() or SSL\_do\_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL\_get\_error() to return the value SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_RETRY\_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL\_CTX\_set\_cert\_verify\_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_RETRY\_VERIFY return value from SSL\_get\_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509\_verify\_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour.

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1\_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSLâs own âd2iâ functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1\_STRING\_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1\_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1\_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the âdataâ and âlengthâ fields in the ASN1\_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1\_STRING\_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1\_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1\_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the âdataâ field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1\_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509\_get1\_email(), X509\_REQ\_get1\_email() and X509\_get1\_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1\_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the âoutâ parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the âoutlenâ parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the âoutâ parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated.

The X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a âpurposeâ has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named âpurposeâ values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature\_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature\_algorithms\_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

The OpenSSL public API function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL\_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL\_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS\_RESP\_verify\_response and TS\_RESP\_verify\_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSLâs s\_server, s\_client and verify tools have support for the â-crl\_downloadâ option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSLâs parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked.

The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue.

In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS\_decrypt or PKCS7\_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt.

If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL\_shutdown() twice (once to send a close\_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable ânon-stitchedâ ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL\_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). AEAD ciphersuites are not impacted.

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the âprefix / âopenssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be â/usr/localâ. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of âC:/usr/localâ, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSLâs default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, â/usr/local/sslâ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own âprefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.

There is an overflow bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN\_mod\_exp may be affected if they use BN\_FLG\_CONSTTIME.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL\_init\_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL\_INIT\_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all.

Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used.

ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.

Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this is considered safe.

Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO\_memcmp function is effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected.

During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.

There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an âerror stateâ mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL\_do\_handshake(), SSL\_accept() and SSL\_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL\_read() or SSL\_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.

If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.

There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attackerâs direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.

This issue only affects OpenSSL 1.1.0a, released on 22nd September 2016. The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a message larger than approx 16k is received then the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer to the old location is left which results in an attempt to write to the previously freed location. This is likely to result in a crash, however it could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.

A DTLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message. This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL\_free() on the failed conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if: 1) The application does not call SSL\_free() in a timely manner in the event that the connection fails or 2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there is very little free memory or 3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for the connection; SSL\_free() has not yet been called; and there is insufficient memory to service the multiple requests. Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is subsequently freed again in the SSL\_free() call. However there is an increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.

In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms. The messages affected are client certificate, client certificate request and server certificate. As a result the attack can only be performed against a client or a server which enables client authentication.

A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP. Builds using the âno-ocspâ build time option are not affected. Servers using OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.1g are not vulnerable in a default configuration, instead only if an application explicitly enables OCSP stapling support.

An overflow can occur in MDC2\_Update() either if called directly or through the EVP\_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. The amount of data needed is comparable to SIZE\_MAX which is impractical on most platforms.

If a server uses SHA512 for TLS session ticket HMAC it is vulnerable to a DoS attack where a malformed ticket will result in an OOB read which will ultimately crash. The use of SHA512 in TLS session tickets is comparatively rare as it requires a custom server callback and ticket lookup mechanism.

Because DES (and triple-DES) has only a 64-bit block size, birthday attacks are a real concern. For example, with the ability to run Javascript in a browser, it is possible to send enough traffic to cause a collision, and then use that information to recover something like a session Cookie. Triple-DES, which shows up as âDES-CBC3â in an OpenSSL cipher string, is still used on the Web, and major browsers are not yet willing to completely disable it. If you run a server, you should disable triple-DES. This is generally a configuration issue. If you run an old server that doesnât support any better ciphers than DES or RC4, you should upgrade. For 1.0.2 and 1.0.1, we removed the triple-DES ciphers from the âHIGHâ keyword and put them into âMEDIUM.â Note that we did not remove them from the âDEFAULTâ keyword. For the 1.1.0 release, we treat triple-DES just like we are treating RC4. It is not compiled by default; you have to use âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ as a config option. Even when those ciphers are compiled, triple-DES is only in the âMEDIUMâ keyword. In addition we also removed it from the âDEFAULTâ keyword.

The function BN\_bn2dec() does not check the return value of BN\_div\_word(). This can cause an OOB write if an application uses this function with an overly large BIGNUM. This could be a problem if an overly large certificate or CRL is printed out from an untrusted source. TLS is not affected because record limits will reject an oversized certificate before it is parsed.

A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records that arrive for future epochs update the replay protection âwindowâ before the MAC for the record has been validated. This could be exploited by an attacker by sending a record for the next epoch (which does not have to decrypt or have a valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This means that all subsequent legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a specific DTLS connection.

In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order those messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed. An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection. By opening many simulataneous connections an attacker could cause a DoS attack through memory exhaustion.

Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to avoid side channel attacks.

Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic A common idiom in the codebase is to check limits in the following manner: âp + len > limitâ Where âpâ points to some mallocâd data of SIZE bytes and limit == p + SIZE âlenâ here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS message). The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that âp + lenâ is only well defined where len <= SIZE. Therefore the above idiom is actually undefined behaviour. For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation provides an address for âpâ such that âp + lenâ actually overflows for values of len that are too big and therefore p + len < limit.

This issue affected versions of OpenSSL prior to April 2015. The bug causing the vulnerability was fixed on April 18th 2015, and released as part of the June 11th 2015 security releases. The security impact of the bug was not known at the time. In previous versions of OpenSSL, ASN.1 encoding the value zero represented as a negative integer can cause a buffer underflow with an out-of-bounds write in i2c\_ASN1\_INTEGER. The ASN.1 parser does not normally create ânegative zeroesâ when parsing ASN.1 input, and therefore, an attacker cannot trigger this bug. However, a second, independent bug revealed that the ASN.1 parser (specifically, d2i\_ASN1\_TYPE) can misinterpret a large universal tag as a negative zero value. Large universal tags are not present in any common ASN.1 structures (such as X509) but are accepted as part of ANY structures. Therefore, if an application deserializes untrusted ASN.1 structures containing an ANY field, and later reserializes them, an attacker may be able to trigger an out-of-bounds write. This has been shown to cause memory corruption that is potentially exploitable with some malloc implementations. Applications that parse and re-encode X509 certificates are known to be vulnerable. Applications that verify RSA signatures on X509 certificates may also be vulnerable; however, only certificates with valid signatures trigger ASN.1 re-encoding and hence the bug. Specifically, since OpenSSLâs default TLS X509 chain verification code verifies the certificate chain from root to leaf, TLS handshakes could only be targeted with valid certificates issued by trusted Certification Authorities.

A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. This issue was introduced as part of the fix for Lucky 13 padding attack (CVE-2013-0169). The padding check was rewritten to be in constant time by making sure that always the same bytes are read and compared against either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer checked that there was enough data to have both the MAC and padding bytes.

An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called function after an EVP\_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP\_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths. Also EVP\_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP\_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have also been analysed too and it is believed there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow could occur. This could still represent a security issue for end user code that calls this function directly.

Internally to OpenSSL the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the PEM\_write\_bio\* family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL command line applications. These internal uses are not considered vulnerable because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible. User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the PEM\_write\_bio\* were vulnerable, and this is reflected in the patch commit message. This is no longer believed to be the case).

A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. Note that traffic between clients and non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or POP) shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is known as DROWN (CVE-2016-0800). Recovering one session key requires the attacker to perform approximately 2^50 computation, as well as thousands of connections to the affected server. A more efficient variant of the DROWN attack exists against unpatched OpenSSL servers using versions that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on 19/Mar/2015 (see CVE-2016-0703 below). Users can avoid this issue by disabling the SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS servers, if theyâve not done so already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also sufficient, provided the patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and 1.0.2f) have been deployed. Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol, and are not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2 ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the use of SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers. OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the following mitigation against DROWN: SSLv2 is now by default disabled at build-time. Builds that are not configured with âenable-ssl2â will not support SSLv2. Even if âenable-ssl2â is used, users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the version-flexible SSLv23\_method() will need to explicitly call either of: SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options(ctx, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2); or SSL\_clear\_options(ssl, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2); as appropriate. Even if either of those is used, or the application explicitly uses the version-specific SSLv2\_method() or its client or server variants, SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery have been removed. Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are no longer available. In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up are now disabled in default builds of OpenSSL. Builds that are not configured with âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ will not provide any âEXPORTâ or âLOWâ strength ciphers.

The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a â%sâ format string in the BIO\_\*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings. Additionally the internal |doapr\_outch| function can attempt to write to an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT\_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing a very long â%sâ format string. Memory leaks can also occur. The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour. These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions in this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.

The SRP user database lookup method SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user had confusing memory management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way of distinguishing these two cases. Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around 300 bytes per connection. Servers that do not configure SRP, or configure SRP but do not configure a seed are not vulnerable. In Apache, the seed directive is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed. To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user is now disabled even if the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user. However, note that OpenSSL makes no strong guarantees about the indistinguishability of valid and invalid logins. In particular, computations are currently not carried out in constant time.

In the BN\_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int value |i|. Later |bn\_expand| is called with a value of |i \* 4|. For large values of |i| this can result in |bn\_expand| not allocating any memory because |i \* 4| is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of |i|, the calculation |i \* 4| could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this case memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN\_dec2bn. This could have security consequences if BN\_hex2bn/BN\_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence. All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line arguments. If user developed applications generate config file data based on untrusted data then it is possible that this could also lead to security consequences. This is also anticipated to be rare.

This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. s2\_srvr.c did not enforce that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers. If clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they *displace* encrypted-key bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if an eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as an oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the server and negligible computation. More importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN that is effective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant computation.

Historically OpenSSL usually only ever generated DH parameters based on âsafeâ primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for generating X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC 5114 support. The primes used in such files may not be âsafeâ. Where an application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that are not âsafeâ then an attacker could use this fact to find a peerâs private DH exponent. This attack requires that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same private DH exponent. For example this could be used to discover a TLS serverâs private DH exponent if itâs reusing the private DH exponent or itâs using a static DH ciphersuite. OpenSSL provides the option SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in TLS. It is not on by default. If the option is not set then the server reuses the same private DH exponent for the life of the server process and would be vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications do set this option and would therefore not be at risk. OpenSSL before 1.0.2f will reuse the key if: - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh() is used and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not set. - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() is used, and both the parameters and the key are set and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not used. This is an undocumted feature and parameter files donât contain the key. - Static DH ciphersuites are used. The key is part of the certificate and so it will always reuse it. This is only supported in 1.0.2. It will not reuse the key for DHE ciphers suites if: - SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is set - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() is used and the callback does not provide the key, only the parameters. The callback is almost always used like this. Non-safe primes are generated by OpenSSL when using: - genpkey with the dh\_rfc5114 option. This will write an X9.42 style file including the prime-order subgroup size âqâ. This is supported since the 1.0.2 version. Older versions canât read files generated in this way. - dhparam with the -dsaparam option. This has always been documented as requiring the single use. The fix for this issue adds an additional check where a âqâ parameter is available (as is the case in X9.42 based parameters). This detects the only known attack, and is the only possible defense for static DH ciphersuites. This could have some performance impact. Additionally the SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE option has been switched on by default and cannot be disabled. This could have some performance impact.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.

A vulnerability existed in previous versions of OpenSSL related to the processing of base64 encoded data. Any code path that reads base64 data from an untrusted source could be affected (such as the PEM processing routines). Maliciously crafted base 64 data could trigger a segmenation fault or memory corruption.

Multiblock corrupted pointer. OpenSSL 1.0.2 introduced the âmultiblockâ performance improvement. This feature only applies on 64 bit x86 architecture platforms that support AES NI instructions. A defect in the implementation of âmultiblockâ can cause OpenSSLâs internal write buffer to become incorrectly set to NULL when using non-blocking IO. Typically, when the user application is using a socket BIO for writing, this will only result in a failed connection. However if some other BIO is used then it is likely that a segmentation fault will be triggered, thus enabling a potential DoS attack.

OpenSSL accepts several non-DER-variations of certificate signature algorithm and signature encodings. OpenSSL also does not enforce a match between the signature algorithm between the signed and unsigned portions of the certificate. By modifying the contents of the signature algorithm or the encoding of the signature, it is possible to change the certificateâs fingerprint. This does not allow an attacker to forge certificates, and does not affect certificate verification or OpenSSL servers/clients in any other way. It also does not affect common revocation mechanisms. Only custom applications that rely on the uniqueness of the fingerprint (e.g. certificate blacklists) may be affected.

Bignum squaring (BN\_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, including x86\_64. This bug occurs at random with a very low probability, and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though its exact impact is difficult to determine. The following has been determined: \*) The probability of BN\_sqr producing an incorrect result at random is very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and 1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms. \*) On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly support), pre-existing countermeasures thwart bug attacks [1]. \*) Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve. However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct such points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private keys is believed to be unaffected. \*) Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and SRP. No exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail - either the attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no private key material is involved.

The Google Security Team discovered several functions inside OpenSSL incorrectly checked the result after calling the EVP\_VerifyFinal function, allowing a malformed signature to be treated as a good signature rather than as an error. This issue affected the signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS. One way to exploit this flaw would be for a remote attacker who is in control of a malicious server or who can use a âman in the middleâ attack to present a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a vulnerable client, bypassing validation.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-06 21:53:58 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS handshakes.  A carefully crafted invalid TLS handshake could crash OpenSSL with a NULL pointer exception.  This flaw only affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1e; earlier versions are not affected and this is corrected in upstream version 1.0.1f [1],[2].  [1] <http://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2013-4353> [2] <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=197e0ea817ad64820789d86711d55ff50d71f631>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-06 22:03:06 UTC  ```  Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1049061](show_bug.cgi?id=1049061 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4353 openssl: TLS record tampering issue can lead to OpenSSL crash [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-06 22:03:08 UTC  ```  Created mingw-openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1049062](show_bug.cgi?id=1049062 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4353 mingw-openssl: openssl: TLS record tampering issue can lead to OpenSSL crash [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-07 16:02:22 UTC  ``` This is a client side issue - an application using OpenSSL library to implement TLS/SSL client functionality can be crashed by malicious TLS/SSL server (or MITM attacker tampering with handshake packets) using this flaw.  Affected code was introduced when Next Protocol Negotiation support was added in version 1.0.1.  Relevant upstream commit:  <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ee2ffc2>  Therefore, only versions 1.0.1 are affected by this issue.  The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier are not affected (they are based on older 0.9.* versions).  The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 before 6.5 were also not affected, as they were based on upstream version 1.0.0.  They were updated to version 1.0.1e in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 via RHBA-2013:1585.  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-1585.html>  Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of openssl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-08 18:19:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0015 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0015.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1049058#c8)  Fedora Update System    2014-01-10 07:45:40 UTC  ``` openssl-1.0.1e-37.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.
