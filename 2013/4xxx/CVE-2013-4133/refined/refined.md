{
  "CVE-2013-4133": {
    "Description": "kde-workspace before 4.10.5 has a memory leak in plasma desktop",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the Plasma desktop component of kde-workspace when handling system tray icons. Specifically, when a system tray icon changes (e.g., during animation or updates), the old pixmap is not properly released, leading to a memory leak.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to improper handling of pixmaps in the system tray."
    ],
    "Impact": "The memory leak can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. As the memory usage increases, the system may become slow or unresponsive. Eventually, the Plasma desktop can crash if the leak is not mitigated.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker can trigger the memory leak by sending notifications or other actions that cause system tray icons to change frequently. This can be done locally or remotely (via network-connected applications that use the system tray).",
       "GTK applications that use the system tray are more prone to triggering this issue."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "The attacker can be a local user or remote user able to send notifications, or execute programs that make use of system tray icons.",
         "No special privileges required."
    ],
     "Additional Information": [
      "The issue is triggered when system tray icons blink or change. This is particularly problematic with applications like IRC clients, Dropbox, and VMware, which have dynamic system tray icons.",
        "The fix for this issue is implemented by ensuring that the old pixmap is properly released when a tray icon changes. This was achieved by using the `QPixmap::ExplicitlyShared` argument."
