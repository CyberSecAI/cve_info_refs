Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4339:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation of the `_wp_http_referer` and `_wp_original_http_referer` parameters, which are used for redirection purposes within WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The lack of proper validation on the referer parameters allows an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs, leading to an open redirect vulnerability. This can be exploited to redirect users to malicious websites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Redirects:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing a manipulated `_wp_http_referer` or `_wp_original_http_referer` parameter. When a user clicks on this URL, they are redirected to a site controlled by the attacker. This can be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs containing the vulnerable parameters (`_wp_http_referer` and `_wp_original_http_referer`). These URLs can be distributed through various channels, such as email, social media, or malicious websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs containing the vulnerable parameters. No specific user privileges or prior authentication is required.  The attacker needs to get a victim to click the specially crafted URL.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in WordPress versions 3.6 and prior (and for one redirector, versions 3.0-3.6).
*   The fix was implemented in WordPress 3.6.1 by introducing the `wp_validate_redirect()` function, which validates the redirect URLs.
* The vulnerable code was in `wp-includes/functions.php` and the fix was introduced to `wp-includes/pluggable.php`.
* The `wp_validate_redirect()` function is designed to prevent off-domain redirects.
* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on November 30, 2013, and fixed on September 11, 2013 in WP 3.6.1.
