Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the TYPO3 Core's File Abstraction Layer (FAL) and its incomplete implementation of access management and file extension checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incomplete Access Management:** The permission handling for file actions (copy, delete, move, etc.) and their locations (file mounts) was not fully implemented in the File Abstraction Layer. Backend user and group file action permissions were not respected, allowing users to bypass file mount restrictions by manipulating URLs. This led to arbitrary file creation and read access within or outside the document root.
2. **Incomplete File Extension Checks:** The mechanism to prevent file uploads with denied extensions was flawed, allowing attackers to rename files to have such extensions. This was achieved by inserting special characters that were later removed. This allowed users to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code, resulting in remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Incomplete Access Management:**
    *   Unprivileged users could create or read arbitrary files.
    *   Users could break out of file mount restrictions.
    *   Could lead to potential data breaches and manipulation.
2.  **Incomplete File Extension Checks:**
    *   Remote code execution.
    *   Arbitrary PHP code execution in the context of the web server.
    *   Complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Incomplete Access Management:** Crafted URLs to bypass file mount restrictions.
2.  **Incomplete File Extension Checks:** Renaming files by inserting special characters into filenames that were later removed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Incomplete Access Management:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated backend user with some file access permissions, but does not need to be an admin user.
2.  **Incomplete File Extension Checks:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated backend user who has some permission to rename files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions that the vulnerability is present in all versions from 6.0.0 up to the development branch of 6.2.
*   The solution involves updating to TYPO3 versions 6.0.9, 6.1.4, or the latest development version.
*   Clearing all caches after updating is crucial for the fix to take effect.
*   The content provides configuration examples for setting file permissions using User TSConfig for more fine-grained control.
*   The advisory mentions CVE-2013-4321 in relation to the remote code execution vulnerability, however CVE-2013-4321 is not mentioned in the original CVE description, which only mentions one CVE (CVE-2013-4320)
