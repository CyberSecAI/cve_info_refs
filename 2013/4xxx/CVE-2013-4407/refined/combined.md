Subject: HTTP::Body before 1.23 for Perl is still vulnerable to CVE-2013-4407

HTTP::Body after 1.07 and before 1.23 for Perl handles multipart file uploads as
temporary files while retaining file extensions. An attacker can provide crafted
filenames containing for example shell metacharacters, affecting programs that
expect these temporary filenames to be well formed.

Version 1.23 of HTTP::Body has been fixed upstream to set a static ".upload"
extension, overriding user provided extensions by default.

Users are recommended to update to version 1.23 or later.

NOTE: Currently, the CVE description incorrectly indicate that this was fixed
in versions after 1.17.

Version 1.18 provided:
- A global variable to set the regex used to validate extensions
- A code comment containing a stricter regex
- No change to the default behavior

Debian and other distributions are carrying a patch for CVE-2013-4407 including
the stricter regex for versions before 1.23.

# CVE-2013-4407

| **Name** | CVE-2013-4407 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | HTTP::Body::Multipart in the HTTP-Body module for Perl (1.07 through 1.22, before 1.23) uses the part of the uploaded file's name after the first "." character as the suffix of a temporary file, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct attacks by leveraging subsequent behavior that may assume the suffix is well-formed. |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Package        : libhttp-body-perl
Vulnerability  : design error
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4407
Debian Bug     : 721634

Jonathan Dolle reported a design error in HTTP::Body, a Perl module for
processing data from HTTP POST requests. The HTTP body multipart parser
creates temporary files which preserve the suffix of the uploaded file.
An attacker able to upload files to a service that uses
HTTP::Body::Multipart could potentially execute commands on the server
if these temporary filenames are used in subsequent commands without
further checks.

This update restricts the possible suffixes used for the created
temporary files.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libhttp-body-perl packages.

Subject: libhttp-body-perl: HTTP::Body::Multipart critical security bug
Date: Mon, 02 Sep 2013 17:47:57 +0200
```
Package: libhttp-body-perl
Version: 1.11-1
Severity: normal

Dear Maintainer,

Hello,

We discovered a critical bug in HTTP::Body::Multipart >= 1.08.

It concerns this point (see changelog) :
	"Temp files now preserve the suffix of the uploaded file"

The following line in HTTP::Body::Multipart is not good:
my $suffix = $basename =~ /[^.]+(\.[^\\\/]+)$/ ? $1 : q{};

It is too much permissive.
For example, with the following file name :
"2013-06-19 at 11.37.56 PM.png"

We can obtain this temp file :
"/tmp/k6gvivOIYK.37.56 PM.png"

It take everithing after the first dot, even spaces !

Previously, the tempname was always alphanumeric. No special chars. So we could use it directly in commands like:
my $info = `identify -format "%m" $filename 2>&1`;

With a space, the command become invalid. Worse : we can easily do 'injections'.
For example with a filename like:
"file. || rm -rf ~ || .png"

I recommand the following regexp:
my $suffix = $basename =~ /[^.]+(\.[\w]+)$/ ? $1 : q{};

Or, for extension like '.tar.gz':
my $suffix = $basename =~ /[^.]+(\.[\w\.]+)$/ ? $1 : q{};
Or better:
my $suffix = $basename =~ /[^.]+((?:\.[\w+])+)$/ ? $1 : q{};

Best regards,
Jonathan Dolle

Subject: HTTP::Body before 1.23 for Perl is still vulnerable to CVE-2013-4407

HTTP::Body after 1.07 and before 1.23 for Perl handles multipart file uploads as
temporary files while retaining file extensions. An attacker can provide crafted
filenames containing for example shell metacharacters, affecting programs that
expect these temporary filenames to be well formed.

Version 1.23 of HTTP::Body has been fixed upstream to set a static ".upload"
extension, overriding user provided extensions by default.

Users are recommended to update to version 1.23 or later.

NOTE: Currently, the CVE description incorrectly indicate that this was fixed
in versions after 1.17.

Version 1.18 provided:
- A global variable to set the regex used to validate extensions
- A code comment containing a stricter regex
- No change to the default behavior

Debian and other distributions are carrying a patch for CVE-2013-4407 including
the stricter regex for versions before 1.23.

# NAME

HTTP::Body - HTTP Body Parser

# SYNOPSIS

```
use HTTP::Body;

sub handler : method {
    my ( $class, $r ) = @_;

    my $content_type   = $r->headers_in->get('Content-Type');
    my $content_length = $r->headers_in->get('Content-Length');

    my $body   = HTTP::Body->new( $content_type, $content_length );
    my $length = $content_length;

    while ( $length ) {

        $r->read( my $buffer, ( $length < 8192 ) ? $length : 8192 );

        $length -= length($buffer);

        $body->add($buffer);
    }

    my $uploads     = $body->upload;     # hashref
    my $params      = $body->param;      # hashref
    my $param_order = $body->param_order # arrayref
    my $body        = $body->body;       # IO::Handle
}
```
# DESCRIPTION

HTTP::Body parses chunks of HTTP POST data and supports application/octet-stream, application/json, application/x-www-form-urlencoded, and multipart/form-data.

Chunked bodies are supported by not passing a length value to new().

It is currently used by [Catalyst](/pod/Catalyst), [Dancer](/pod/Dancer), [Maypole](/pod/Maypole), [Web::Simple](/pod/Web%3A%3ASimple) and [Jedi](/pod/Jedi).

# NOTES

When parsing multipart bodies, temporary files are created to store any uploaded files. You must delete these temporary files yourself after processing them, or set $body->cleanup(1) to automatically delete them at DESTROY-time.

With version 1.23, we have changed the basic behavior of how temporary files are prepared for uploads. The extension of the file is no longer transferred to the temporary file, the extension will always be `.upload`. We have also introduced variables that make it possible to set the behavior as required.

$HTTP::Body::MultiPart::file\_temp\_suffix

This is the extension that is given to all multipart files. The default setting here is `.upload`. If you want the old behavior from before version 1.23, simply undefine the value here.

$HTTP::Body::MultiPart::basename\_regexp

This is the regexp used to determine out the file extension. This is of course no longer necessary, unless you undefine `HTTP::Body::MultiPart::file_temp_suffix`.

$HTTP::Body::MultiPart::file\_temp\_template

This gets passed through to the [File::Temp](/pod/File%3A%3ATemp) TEMPLATE parameter. There is no special default in our module.

%HTTP::Body::MultiPart::file\_temp\_parameters

In this hash you can add up custom settings for the [File::Temp](/pod/File%3A%3ATemp) invokation. Those override every other setting.

# METHODS

new

Constructor. Takes content type and content length as parameters, returns a [HTTP::Body](/pod/release/GETTY/HTTP-Body-1.23/lib/HTTP/Body.pm) object.

add

Add string to internal buffer. Will call spin unless done. returns length before adding self.

body

accessor for the body.

chunked

Returns 1 if the request is chunked.

cleanup

Set to 1 to enable automatic deletion of temporary files at DESTROY-time.

content\_length

Returns the content-length for the body data if known. Returns -1 if the request is chunked.

content\_type

Returns the content-type of the body data.

init

return self.

length

Returns the total length of data we expect to read if known. In the case of a chunked request, returns the amount of data read so far.

trailing\_headers

If a chunked request body had trailing headers, trailing\_headers will return an HTTP::Headers object populated with those headers.

spin

Abstract method to spin the io handle.

state

Returns the current state of the parser.

param

Get/set body parameters.

upload

Get/set file uploads.

part\_data

Just like 'param' but gives you a hash of the full data associated with the part in a multipart type POST/PUT. Example:

```
{

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
