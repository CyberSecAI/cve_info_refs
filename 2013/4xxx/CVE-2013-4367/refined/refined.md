```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the improper use of `os.chmod()` in Python scripts within ovirt-engine. Specifically, passing a mode of '-1' to `os.chmod()`, which was intended to do nothing, results in setting all possible bits on due to a change in the Linux kernel (version 3.1 and newer).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper use of `os.chmod()` function in python script.
- Incorrect assumption about the behavior of `os.chmod()` with mode '-1'.
- World-writable permissions being set on configuration files.

Impact of exploitation:
- Configuration files become world-writable.
- Potential for unauthorized modification of system settings.
- Possible privilege escalation due to modified configuration files.

Attack vectors:
- Exploitation of this vulnerability requires the affected software running on a Linux kernel 3.1 or newer.
- An attacker would need to have access to the system where the affected ovirt-engine is running.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Access to the system where the affected ovirt-engine is running.
- Ability to modify configuration files due to the world-writable permissions.
