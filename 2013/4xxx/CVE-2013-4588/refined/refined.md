Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4588:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Linux kernel's IP Virtual Server (IP_VS) implementation had a flaw in how it handled ioctl commands related to setting and retrieving socket options. Specifically, the code was missing a check to ensure that the command (cmd) was within the valid range of the array used to determine the data length for copying data into a stack buffer, allowing out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability was a stack buffer overflow. By providing an invalid command, the code could use an out-of-bounds index into the length array. This would lead to a "garbage" length value being used, and an attacker could potentially overwrite the stack buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability could exploit this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system by causing a buffer overflow in the kernel.
- **Denial of Service:**  Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, a buffer overflow could also lead to a crash of the kernel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack vector was local, requiring the attacker to have access to the system.
- **`setsockopt(2)` and `getsockopt(2)` system calls**: The vulnerability is triggered by calling `setsockopt(2)` or `getsockopt(2)` with crafted input to interact with the IP_VS functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needed to have the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability which is required to perform IP_VS operations. This means they needed to be a privileged user on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in the `do_ip_vs_set_ctl` and `do_ip_vs_get_ctl` functions.
- The fix involved adding checks to validate the ioctl command range and copy size, preventing out-of-bounds access to the array and ensuring data length is within limits before copying.
- Although initially considered a security vulnerability, it was later determined that a similar bounds check was already present in the `nf_sockopt_find` routine, thus making it a non-issue.

The fix for the vulnerability was implemented in the Linux kernel via this commit:
https://git.kernel.org/linus/04bcef2a83f40c6db24222b27a52892cba39dffb

It is important to note that Red Hat initially did not consider this issue to be a security flaw due to the existing checks.
