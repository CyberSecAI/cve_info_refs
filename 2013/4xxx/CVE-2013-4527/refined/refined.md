  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The HPET (High Precision Event Timer) code in QEMU uses a VARRAY with a uint8_t size but a static array of 32. The index (num_timers) into this array is not checked for sanity during state loading.",

      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
