  "CVE-2013-4183": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Cve ID": "CVE-2013-4183",
      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Cinder LVM volume driver did not zero out data when deleting snapshots.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper deletion of data leading to potential data exposure",
        "Lack of secure deletion for LVM snapshots."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of sensitive information to authenticated users when subsequent servers use the volume.",
      "Attack vectors": "Exploitation occurs through the Cinder API when deleting snapshots, and subsequent volume use.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires an authenticated user within the OpenStack environment with access to Cinder API."
    },
    "Additional Details": {
          "Affected Component": "Cinder LVM volume driver",
          "Affected Versions": "2013.1 (Grizzly) and later",
          "Mitigation": "Update to patched versions of openstack-cinder packages.",
          "Notes": "The issue is specifically related to the LVM driver and when secure deletes are configured, but are not properly executed on snapshots. Thinly-provisioned volumes are not affected, since blocks are not allocated until written. Distros were also advised to fix their kernel bugs rather than disabling the secure_delete option."
