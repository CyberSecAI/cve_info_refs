# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0658)

## Topic

Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix two security issues and add one
enhancement are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-cinder packages provide OpenStack Volume (code name Cinder),
which provides services to manage and access block storage volumes for use
by virtual machine instances.

A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
parser used by Cinder. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
specially-crafted request to a Cinder API, causing Cinder to consume an
excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Cinder. If a remote attacker
sent a specially-crafted request to a Cinder API, it could cause Cinder to
connect to external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or
allow an attacker to read files on the Cinder server that are accessible
to the user running Cinder. (CVE-2013-1665)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* This update implements a Cinder driver that allows Red Hat Storage to be

used as a back-end for Cinder volumes. To use this driver,
"volume\_driver = cinder.volume.glusterfs.GlusterfsDriver" and the
"glusterfs\_shares\_config" option must be set in "/etc/cinder/cinder.conf",
and the RHSA-2013:0657 openstack-nova update must also be installed. Note
that there is no volume snapshot or clone support when using this driver.
(BZ#892686)

All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which fix these issues and add this enhancement. After installing
the updated packages, the Cinder running services will be restarted
automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

# [OSSA 2013-021] Cinder LVM volume driver does not support secure deletion (CVE-2013-4183)

Bug #1198185 reported by
[Rongze Zhu](https://launchpad.net/~zrzhit)
on 2013-07-05

[256](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Cinder](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder) | Fix Released | High | [Rongze Zhu](https://launchpad.net/~zrzhit) | [Cinder 2013.2 "havana"](https://launchpad.net/cinder/%2Bmilestone/2013.2) |

|  | [OpenStack Security Advisory](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa) | Fix Released | Medium | [Jeremy Stanley](https://launchpad.net/~fungi) |  |

### Bug Description

the delete action process:

    delete\_snapshot(self, snapshot) -> self.\_delete\_volume(snapshot, snapshot['volume\_size']) -> self.clear\_volume(volume)

def clear\_volume(self, volume):

        """unprovision old volumes to prevent data leaking between users."""

vol\_path = self.local\_path(volume)

        size\_in\_g = volume.get('size')

        size\_in\_m = self.configuration.volume\_clear\_size

if not size\_in\_g:

            LOG.warning(\_("Size for volume: %s not found, "

                          "skipping secure delete.") % volume['name'])

            return

         ....

         ....

Because snapshot without 'size' field, so it will skip secure delete.

Proposed impact description (will be used in CVE request and public advisory):

----------------------------------

Title: Cinder LVMVolumeDriver does not zero deleted snapshots

Reporter: Rongze Zhu

Products: Cinder

Affects: 2012.2 (Grizzly) and later

Description:

Rongze Zhu reported a vulnerability in the Cinder LVM volume driver.

When deleting an LVM volume snapshot the previous contents may not

be zeroed, resulting in potential exposure of latent data to

subsequent servers for other tenants. Only setups using

LVMVolumeDriver are affected.

----------------------------------

Everyone: please check that the description is accurate.

Rongze Zhu: do you want us to additionally credit the company you work for (SINA, UnitedStack, anyone)?

Yes, since I don't personally know much about the interrelationships between various Cinder drivers, I'm hoping someone will answer his question at which point I can update the description accordingly.

Ummm.... do a block by block delete on a thinly provisioned device? That seems like a quick way to make a mess of things. Don't think that's a good idea at all.

So IMO the description could be changed slightly:

The issue here IMO is not so much that the data is not being zero'd BUT that the folks implementing this are expecting

that it is.

We currently have a flag that allows you to turn on/off secure delete, and keep in mind this was turned off on snapshots

intentionally due to the kernel hang issue on Ubuntu/Precise.

There have been a number of proposals for trying to do this in a way that might not cause the kernel crash but they've

encountered objection in reviews (but that's another topic).

Okay, so stepping back a bit, it's not really a question of literally zeroing the block device in this case, but rather whether or not secure delete is enabled for LVM2 snapshots. Does this mean the report here is effectively a duplicate of [bug 1134768](/bugs/1134768)? If so, it sounds like we're proposing an announcement that secure delete is off by default because it's broken on Debian derived distributions, but that deployers who want to enable it for their environments are free to do so.

If that's the situation, this probably is better suited to drop into the OSSN queue (likely with a CVE assignment), rather than issue an OSSA. Am I misinterpreting this?

Yes, it's a duplicate.. and before anyone asks, no I don't remember why I

marked it as won't fix, but that should not have been the case.

That's my thought exactly, I'll actually just set a flag and turn the old

"dd/zero" method back on as an option while folks argue about the proposals

currently in flight for how to do this better.

delete is enabled for LVM2 snapshots. Does this mean the report here is

effectively a duplicate of [bug 1134768](/bugs/1134768)? If so, it sounds like we're

<jdg>:Yes, it's a duplicate.. and before anyone asks, no I don't remember why I marked it as won't fix, but that should not have been the case.</jdg>

proposing an announcement that secure delete is off by default because

it's broken on Debian derived distributions, but that deployers who want

to enable it for their environments are free to do so.

<jdg>:That's my thought exactly, I'll actually just set a flag and turn the old "dd/zero" method back on as an option while folks argue about the proposals currently in flight for how to do this better.</jdg>

If that's the situation, this probably is better suited to drop into the

OSSN queue (likely with a CVE assignment), rather than issue an OSSA. Am

I misinterpreting this?

<jdg>I was unfamiliar with OSSN, but that does seem more appropriate to me.</jdg>

Thierry and Mikal may correct me on this, but my interpretation is that if it's a security vulnerability in OpenStack for which we've got a fix (maybe even if that just means beefing up available options for deployers or making more verbose disclaimers in logs and interfaces), then the VMT issues an OSSA. On the other hand if there's nothing to be fixed and this is merely a matter of setting long-term expectations on the security failings of a particular feature for the benefit of improved understanding within the OpenStack community, then the OSSG issues an OSSN (with or without a CVE as appropriate).

@fungi: your interpretation is correct... although I wouldn't consider "adding an option that defaults to disabled" to be an acceptable fix, and if that is our answer to an issue, then it should fall on the OSSN bucket (think "known issues and limitations").

I propose we mark this one as a dupe of the other, and that we reopen the other... but first I would like to get the consequences right. We don't zero on delete, but are we cleaning up the volume before it's given to new users ? Or do all default deployers of Cinder/LVM expect to expose stale data from previous tenants on block devices they hand out ? If the latter, I'd be tempted to change the default for secure\_delete to ON and let the distros fix their kernel bug (or take the responsibility to change that option default themselves).

Enable zero the snapshot when delete snapshot in LVMVolumeDriver

Because snapshot without 'size' field, So clear\_volume method in

    LVMVolumeDriver will skip secure deleting. Get the size of snapshot from

    'volume\_size' filed, So it can zero the snapshot.

Remove the 'size\_in\_g' parameter in \_delete\_volume method, because it never

    used. Add a unittest for clear\_volume method.

So after discussing this with jgriffith I think it definitely warrants an OSSA because people with secure delete enabled may currently be handing out non-zeroed space in case of deleted snapshots.

As an additional thing (to be filed as another bug) for havana I would consider setting secure\_delete to ON and let the distros workaround kernel bugs they may still have by keeping it disabled in their own packaging.

Ok, so after further conversations, this should be a SA, the driver should do secure delete by default and it's up to the distros to fix their bugs.

@eharney: As far as the question regarding thin LVM driver, my opinion is that since the blocks here aren't allocated until they're actually used that it should not be necessary. That being said we should have an intelligent method implemented that actually handles allocated blocks (and only allocated blocks) just to give everybody a warm fuzzy. I would say that it should not be part of this SA but however we should have this work in place as a feature addition to the thin driver for the H release.

That being the case, I think a slightly different impact description is in order:

----------------------------------

Title: Cinder LVM volume drivers do not support secure deletion

Reporter: Rongze Zhu

Products: Cinder

Affects: 2013.1 (Grizzly) and later

Description:

Rongze Zhu reported a vulnerability in Cinder LVM volume drivers.

The contents of LVM snapshots may not be cleared upon deletion even

when secure deletes are configured, resulting in potential exposure

of latent data to subsequent servers for other tenants. Only setups

using LVMVolumeDriver or ThinLVMVolumeDriver are affected.

----------------------------------

Everyone: please check that the description is accurate.

Rongze Zhu: do you want us to additionally credit the company you work for (SINA, UnitedStack, anyone)?

Enable zero the snapshot when delete snapshot in LVMVolumeDriver

Because snapshot without 'size' field, So clear\_volume method in

    LVMVolumeDriver will skip secure deleting. Get the size of snapshot from

    'volume\_size' filed, So it can zero the snapshot.

Remove the 'size\_in\_g' parameter in \_delete\_volume method, because it never

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-cinder security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1198)

## Topic

Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-cinder packages provide OpenStack Volume (Cinder), which
provides services to manage and access block storage volumes for use by
virtual machine instances.

It was found that the fixes for CVE-2013-1664 and CVE-2013-1665, released
via RHSA-2013:0658, did not fully correct the issues in the Extensible
Markup Language (XML) parser used by Cinder. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to a Cinder API, causing
Cinder to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory, or possibly crash.
(CVE-2013-4202)

A bug in the Cinder LVM driver prevented LVM snapshots from being securely
deleted in some cases, potentially leading to information disclosure to
other tenants. (CVE-2013-4183)

The CVE-2013-4202 issue was discovered by Grant Murphy of the Red Hat
Product Security Team.

Additionally, openstack-cinder has been rebased to the latest Grizzly
stable release 2013.1.3. (BZ#993094)

All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the Cinder running services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

# RHSA-2013:0658 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-cinder security and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0658)

## Topic

Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix two security issues and add one
enhancement are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-cinder packages provide OpenStack Volume (code name Cinder),
which provides services to manage and access block storage volumes for use
by virtual machine instances.

A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
parser used by Cinder. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
specially-crafted request to a Cinder API, causing Cinder to consume an
excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Cinder. If a remote attacker
sent a specially-crafted request to a Cinder API, it could cause Cinder to
connect to external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or
allow an attacker to read files on the Cinder server that are accessible
to the user running Cinder. (CVE-2013-1665)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* This update implements a Cinder driver that allows Red Hat Storage to be

used as a back-end for Cinder volumes. To use this driver,
"volume\_driver = cinder.volume.glusterfs.GlusterfsDriver" and the
"glusterfs\_shares\_config" option must be set in "/etc/cinder/cinder.conf",
and the RHSA-2013:0657 openstack-nova update must also be installed. Note
that there is no volume snapshot or clone support when using this driver.
(BZ#892686)

All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which fix these issues and add this enhancement. After installing
the updated packages, the Cinder running services will be restarted
automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
