     *   **Weaknesses:** Allows for direct injection of SQL commands through user-provided input and injection of malicious code into the output displayed to users.
     *   **Impact:** High. Could lead to data breach, manipulation, or denial of service and the ability to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Not specified in detail. Likely involves sending malicious SQL queries via web form or URL parameters and injecting malicious code through user input.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Remote, authenticated, according to CVSS vector.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory is a "Collective Security Bulletin (CSB)" which is used for listing vulnerabilities in less prominent extensions to reduce the workload of the security team.
*   The vulnerabilities are in third-party extensions, not the TYPO3 core.
*   Patches are available for "fed", "wec\_discussion", and "myquizpoll". The extensions "push2rss\_3ds" and "slideshare" were removed from the extension repository.
*   CVSS v2.0 scores are provided for each vulnerability, indicating the severity.
*   The advisory provides general recommendations to follow the TYPO3 Security Guide.
