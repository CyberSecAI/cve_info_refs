  "cveId": "CVE-2013-4483",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the way ipc_rcu_putref() function in the Linux kernel's IPC implementation handled reference counter decrementing. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger an Out of Memory (OOM) condition and, potentially, crash the system.",

    "rootCause": "The `ipc_rcu_putref()` function in the Linux kernel's IPC implementation had a flaw in how it handled reference counter decrements.",
