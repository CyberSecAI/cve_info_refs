Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the Jira ticket SERVER-9983:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unnecessary database lock taken when authenticating as the internal `__system` user. During the authentication process, the system attempts to read a privilege document in the "admin" database, which will never exist for the internal user. This read operation acquires a database lock, causing a potential bottleneck.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unnecessary locking**: The system performs a read lock on the "admin" database even when authenticating as an internal user, which doesn't require this operation. This can lead to resource contention, especially under heavy load or frequent authentication attempts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The unnecessary database lock can cause performance degradation, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition. It could prevent or slow down other operations that require database access.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Authentication**:  An attacker would need to be able to trigger an authentication attempt as the internal `__system` user. This could be achieved in situations where access to internal operations is available but not properly restricted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need a way to trigger an authentication attempt as the internal `__system` user. This could potentially be an internal user with the ability to invoke the authentication process in a way that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Jira ticket labels include `asp-vuln-dos`, indicating this vulnerability was identified internally as a potential denial-of-service issue.
- The issue is labeled as fixed in versions 2.4.5 and 2.5.1, indicating that the fix involves preventing the admin database check for internal user authentication and removing the need for locking.
- The description notes that the internal user will never have a privilege document in the admin database. This information is used in determining the fix to not check when the internal user authenticates.
- The content provided on the security bulletin page does not specifically reference this vulnerability, but confirms that MongoDB uses Jira to track bugs and feature requests.
