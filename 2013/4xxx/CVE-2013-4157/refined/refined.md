Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-4157:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insecure temporary file creation within the Red Hat Storage server's `ktune.sh` scripts. Specifically, these scripts use the `find` command and redirect standard error to a file in the `/tmp` directory.
- The scripts create temporary files with predictable names in the `/tmp` directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insecure temporary file creation:** The scripts create temporary files in a shared location (`/tmp`) with predictable names.
- **Symbolic link attack:**  A local user can create a symbolic link in `/tmp` with the same name as one of the insecurely created temp files, redirecting the root user's operations to a file controlled by the local user when the `ktune.sh` scripts are executed as root.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary file overwrite:** A local attacker could overwrite arbitrary files on the system as the root user by creating a symbolic link with the same name as a temporary file created by the vulnerable scripts.
- In the example provided, a local user was able to overwrite the `/etc/passwd` file which could cause a system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local user access to the Red Hat Storage server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local user access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the Red Hat Storage server.
- **Ability to create symbolic links:** The attacker needs the ability to create symbolic links in the `/tmp` directory.
