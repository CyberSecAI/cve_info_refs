Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from the combination of a known PHP vulnerability (CVE-2012-1823) and the way Parallels Plesk Panel uses a `phppath` script alias. The `phppath` script was likely configured to allow access to PHP execution, which, when combined with the vulnerability in PHP (CVE-2012-1823), results in arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Vulnerable PHP version (CVE-2012-1823):** The core issue is a known vulnerability in the PHP interpreter that allows for command injection through crafted requests.
2.  **Insecure Plesk Panel Alias Usage:** Plesk's `phppath` alias is not properly secured and exposes the PHP interpreter in a way that can be exploited via CVE-2012-1823. This script alias is the point of attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This can lead to a complete compromise of the Plesk server, including data theft, malware installation, and service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `phppath` alias on the Plesk Panel. These requests are designed to exploit the PHP vulnerability (CVE-2012-1823).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Plesk Panel server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Parallels Plesk Panel versions 9.0 - 9.2.3 on Linux platforms.
*   Exploitation of this vulnerability was observed "in the wild" indicating active exploitation by malicious actors
*   The vulnerability was disclosed publicly on the Full Disclosure mailing list.
*   The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS base score of 7.5, a temporal score of 6.5, and environmental score of 4.9
*   The recommended solution is to upgrade to a supported version of Plesk Panel or to apply the vendor provided mitigations.
