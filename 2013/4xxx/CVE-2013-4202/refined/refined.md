Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4202:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure processing of XML data within the Cinder component of OpenStack. Specifically, the use of `minidom.parseString` directly in certain Cinder API extensions makes them vulnerable to XML entity expansion attacks, which can lead to resource exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML Entity Expansion:** The core weakness is the susceptibility of the affected code to XML entity expansion attacks (also known as "billion laughs" or "quadratic blowup" attacks). These attacks involve specially crafted XML payloads that cause an exponential expansion of XML entities, consuming excessive server resources.
- **Insecure XML Parsing:** The direct use of `minidom.parseString` in Cinder's API extensions exposes the system to the above attacks since it does not prevent the parsing of DTDs, unlike `xmlutils.safe_minidom_parse_string`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service by exhausting the CPU and memory resources of the Cinder API server.
- **Potential System Crash:** The resource exhaustion caused by this vulnerability may lead to a crash of the Cinder API service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attack is initiated remotely, and does not require any prior authentication or access to the system.
- **Cinder API:** The attack vector is through specially crafted XML requests sent to the vulnerable Cinder API endpoints, specifically the contributed backups or volume transfer API extensions in Grizzly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the Cinder API.
- **No Authentication Required:** No user account or authentication is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in the Grizzly release of OpenStack Cinder, but not in the Folsom release.
- The fix involves replacing direct calls to `minidom.parseString` with `xmlutils.safe_minidom_parse_string` within the affected API extensions.
- The patch also included test cases to prevent regressions.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Grant Murphy of Red Hat Product Security.
- Red Hat assigned CVE-2013-4202 specifically for Cinder-related XML entity expansion issues while using CVE-2013-4179 for Nova-related ones.
