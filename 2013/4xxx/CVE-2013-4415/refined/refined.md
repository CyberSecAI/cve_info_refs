  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2013-4415",
    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way Red Hat Satellite and Spacewalk services used to sanitize content of various query string (QS) variables when performing search for various entities:\n\n* when performing search for software channels value of 'whereCriteria' QS variable was incorrectly sanitized,\n* when performing search for scap audit results the values of the following QS variables were incorrectly sanitized:\n      'end_year', 'start_hour', 'end_am_pm', 'end_day', 'end_hour', 'end_minute', 'end_month', 'end_year', 'optionScanDateSearch', 'result_filter', 'search_string', 'show_as', 'start_am_pm', 'start_day', 'start_hour', 'start_minute', 'start_month', 'start_year', and 'whereToSearch',\n* when performing search for errata the values of the following QS variables were incorrectly sanitized:\n      'end_minute', 'end_month', 'end_year', 'errata_type_bug', 'errata_type_enhancement', 'errata_type_security', 'fineGrained', 'list_1892635924_sortdir', 'optionIssueDateSearch', 'start_am_pm', 'start_day', 'start_hour', 'start_minute', 'start_month', 'start_year', and 'view_mode',\n* when performing search for systems the value of the 'fineGrained' QS variable was incorrectly sanitized.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Red Hat Satellite",
      "Spacewalk"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this issue is within `PAGE_SIZE_LABEL_SELECTED`. The services failed to properly sanitize query string variables when performing searches.",
    "vulnerability": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
     "impact": "Remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page that, when visited by authenticated Red Hat Satellite or Spacewalk user would lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the context of Red Hat Satellite's / Spacewalk's user's session.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can provide a specially crafted link or web page.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious web page or link that would be visited by an authenticated Red Hat Satellite or Spacewalk user.",
     "remediation": "The issue was addressed in Red Hat Satellite Server v 5.6 via RHSA-2014:0148, which includes updated `spacewalk-java`, `spacewalk-web`, and `satellite-branding` packages. Patches should be applied to affected systems and Red Hat Satellite should be restarted."
