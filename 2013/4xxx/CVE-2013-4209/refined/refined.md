Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT). Specifically, it involves the inclusion of SHA1 checksums (SHA1SUM) of files within the bug reports generated by ABRT.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leak:** The core weakness is that ABRT exposes SHA1SUMs of files, including those that a local attacker should not have access to. This leak could provide an attacker with potentially sensitive information.
- **Unauthorized Access:**  A local user is able to obtain information about files that they do not have authorized access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Limited Information Exposure:** The vulnerability is described as a "substantially limited leak of unauthorized information". The main impact is the exposure of SHA1SUMs of files.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:**  While the immediate impact is limited to revealing file checksums, this information might be used as a building block for further attacks, although this isn't explicitly mentioned.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:**  The attacker needs to have local access to the system where ABRT is running.
- **ABRT Usage:** The attacker would need to trigger an event that causes ABRT to generate a bug report, thereby revealing the SHA1SUMs in the report.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:**  The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
- **Ability to trigger ABRT:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger an event that would cause ABRT to create a bug report.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- **Not Vulnerable in RHEL 6:** The issue did not affect the versions of ABRT shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability was fixed in ABRT version 2.1.6
- **Upstream Commit:** An upstream commit (<https://github.com/abrt/abrt/commit/776209bd00b0dd16d02dd20fdb14eecbb6b9fa18>) changed the format of core backtraces and source file hashes are no longer included for python exception reports. This commit is related to addressing the vulnerability.
- **Acknowledgement:** The vulnerability was discovered by Jan Pokorn√Ω of Red Hat.
