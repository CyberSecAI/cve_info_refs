  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-4207",
      "description": "It was discovered that non-coprime values in DSA signatures can cause a buffer overflow in the calculation code of modular inverses when verifying a DSA signature. Such a signature is invalid. This bug however applies to any DSA signature received by PuTTY, including during the initial key exchange phase and thus it can be exploited by a malicious server before the client has received and verified a host key signature.",
      "root_cause": "Non-coprime values in DSA signatures leading to a buffer overflow during modular inverse calculation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
       "impact": "A malicious server can exploit this vulnerability before the client has received and verified a host key signature, bypassing normal host key protections against man-in-the-middle attacks.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious server or a man-in-the-middle attacker can send crafted DSA signatures to the PuTTY client during the initial key exchange phase.",
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to act as a malicious server or a man-in-the-middle attacker during the SSH handshake with the vulnerable client."
