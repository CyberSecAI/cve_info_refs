{
  "CVE-2013-4210": {
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of the org.jboss.remoting.transport.socket.ServerThread class in JBoss Remoting. An attacker could use this flaw to exhaust all available file descriptors on the target server, preventing legitimate connections. Note that to exploit this flaw remotely, the remoting port must be exposed directly or indirectly (for example, deploying a public facing application that uses JBoss Remoting could indirectly expose this flaw).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `org.jboss.remoting.transport.socket.ServerThread` class within JBoss Remoting.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service vulnerability due to improper handling of file descriptors."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exhaust all available file descriptors on the target server, preventing legitimate connections and leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote, through the JBoss remoting port, which must be exposed directly or indirectly.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. It requires the remoting port to be exposed either directly or indirectly."
  }
