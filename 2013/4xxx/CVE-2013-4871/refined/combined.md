# TYPO3-EXT-SA-2013-007: Several vulnerabilities in third party extensions

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the following third-party TYPO3 extensions: accessible\_is\_browse\_results, maag\_formcaptcha, meta\_feedit, rzautocomplete, sb\_folderdownload, sg\_zfelib, sg\_zlib, tq\_seo

**Release Date:** June 03, 2013

**Please read first:** This Collective Security Bulletin (CSB) is a listing of vulnerable extensions with neither significant download numbers, nor other special importance amongst the TYPO3 Community. The intention of CSBs is to reduce the workload of the TYPO3 Security Team and of the maintainers of extensions with vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities in TYPO3 core or important extensions will still get the well-known single Security Bulletin each.

Please read our [buzz blog post](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/collective-security-bulletins-csb-the-reason-for/), which has a detailed explanation on CSBs.

All vulnerabilities affect third-party extensions. These extensions are not part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Extension:** Library for Frontend plugins (sg\_zfelib)

**Affected Versions:** 1.1.774 and all versions below

**Vulnerability Type:** Arbitrary Code Execution, Priviledge Escalation, File Disclosure

**Severity:** Critical

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "Opens external link in new window") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**Solution:** Versions of this extension that are known to be vulnerable will no longer be available for download from the TYPO3 Extension Repository. The extension author failed in providing a security fix for the reported vulnerability in a decent amount of time. Please uninstall and delete the extension folder from your installation.

**Credits:** Credits go to Stefan Fröhner who discovered and reported the issues.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
