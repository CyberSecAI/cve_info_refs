# PM95817: SECURITY RISKS AS A RESULT OF PSIRT SCANS.

## Subscribe

You can track all active APARs for this component.

##

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  Here is a listing of some of the security issues that may be
  seen:

  - A remote attacker (unauthenticated) can send one HTTP request
  to retrieve the content of the application log files.

  - An attacker who is able to trick a user into clicking on a
  link may be able to execute a script of their choosing.  This
  might be used to allow the attacker to steal or manipulate
  customer session and cookies, which might be used to impersonate
  a legitimate user, allowing the hacker to view or alter user
  records, and to perform transactions as that user.

  - An attacker who is able to trick a user into clicking on a
  link may be able to steal the credentials from the legitimate
  user.

  - A remote attacker can instruct the Eclipse Business
  Intelligence Reporting Tool ViewerServlet to parse a rogue XML
  file residing on the adjacent network (e.g. Windows share on the
  same LAN). Because the XML parser used is misconfigured, the
  <DOCTYPE> directive is allowed, and external XML entities can be
  defined and referenced. This allows the remote attacker to reach
  internal services behind the firewall, or to retrieve files from
  the server.

  - A remote attacker can retrieve system information, including
  File System paths, release number, environment variables and
  encrypted passwords with a simple URL. Because the passwords are
  encrypted with a hard-coded key (identical to every SPSS
  installations) there is the potential risk that the passwords
  can be decrypted. The encryption key can be found in the
  com/spss/crypto/common/GenericAlgorithm.class entry inside the
  C:\qatest\ws8\profiles\AppSrv01\installedApps\w2k8nonr2Node01Cel
  l\IBM_SPSS_Collaboration_and_Deployment_Services_6.0.ear\lib\cry
  pto.jar file.
