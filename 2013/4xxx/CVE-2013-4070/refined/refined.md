Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4070:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Deployment Portal application that allows unauthorized access to an internal password. The password is encrypted with a hard-coded key which is identical across all SPSS installations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The application exposes an internal password.
-  **Weak Cryptography:**  The use of a hard-coded encryption key (the same for all installations) makes the encryption easily breakable once the key is discovered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to the internal password, potentially leading to further unauthorized access to the system and data.
- **Potential for Decryption:** The use of a hardcoded key makes it possible to decrypt the exposed password.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The vulnerability can be exploited via a simple URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   Remote attacker with knowledge of the vulnerable URL.
- The attacker needs to find the encryption key in the `com/spss/crypto/common/GenericAlgorithm.class` entry in a jar file within the application directory.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability affects all deployments of IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services.
- The provided content includes the location of the hardcoded key: `C:\qatest\ws8\profiles\AppSrv01\installedApps\w2k8nonr2Node01Cel\IBM_SPSS_Collaboration_and_Deployment_Services_6.0.ear\lib\crypto.jar`
-   The vulnerability is addressed in SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services 5.0 FP3 and 4.2.1.3 IF003.
