{
  "CVE-2013-4301": {
    "Description": "The MediaWiki ResourceLoader does not sanitize the lang parameter, leading to a full path disclosure when an invalid language code is supplied. This is due to the system directly using the parameter to construct file paths and then throwing a verbose exception that includes server file paths when the code is invalid.",
    "Root cause": "The `lang` parameter in the ResourceLoader was not sanitized before being used in file path construction, leading to a verbose exception that included server file paths when the language code is invalid.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input sanitization",
       "Verbose error messages"
    ],
    "Impact": "Full path disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive information about the server's file structure.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "By crafting a URL with an invalid `lang` parameter"
      ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs only to send a crafted request."
  }
