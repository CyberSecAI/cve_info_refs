The provided content relates to CVE-2013-4547.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by incorrect handling of unescaped space characters in the request URI. Some checks on the request URI were not executed on a character following an unescaped space character. While spaces in URIs are invalid according to the HTTP protocol, nginx allowed them for compatibility reasons.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Security restriction bypass due to flawed whitespace parsing.
- Incorrect handling of URIs containing spaces leading to potential file processing vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Bypassing security restrictions, such as location-based access controls (e.g. `deny all` in a specific location block).
- Triggering processing of files in an unintended way (e.g. executing PHP scripts that should not be accessible).

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with unescaped spaces in the URI. Examples:
    - `/foo /../protected/file`
    - `/file \0.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary HTTP requests to the vulnerable nginx server.
