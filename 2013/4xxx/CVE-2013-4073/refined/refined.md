Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Ruby's SSL client's hostname identity check. The client incorrectly handles hostnames in certificates that contain NULL bytes. Specifically, when parsing the `subjectAltName` X509 extension, the code uses `sprintf()` which is null-byte unsafe. This leads to the client incorrectly identifying a certificate as valid for a given domain when it contains a crafted hostname with a null byte.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The code doesn't properly validate the hostname from the `subjectAltName` extension for NULL bytes before performing the identity check.
*   **Null Byte Vulnerability:** The usage of `sprintf()` in `OpenSSL::X509::Extension#value`  is vulnerable to null byte injection which leads to the truncation of the string being checked.
*  **Inadequate Hostname Verification:** The SSL client's hostname verification logic fails to properly handle hostnames with embedded null bytes in the certificate's subjectAltName field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to conduct man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks by spoofing legitimate SSL servers.
*   **Bypassing SSL Trust:** By obtaining a carefully crafted certificate, signed by a trusted authority, with a hostname containing a null byte, an attacker can deceive the Ruby SSL client into accepting the malicious certificate as valid for the intended domain.
*   **Confidentiality and Integrity Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to potentially intercept and manipulate data transmitted between the client and server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is network-based and can be performed by an attacker positioned to intercept or manipulate network traffic between a Ruby client and a server.
*   **Certificate Manipulation:** The attacker needs a specially crafted certificate issued by a trusted CA, which has a null byte injected into the subjectAltName, for spoofing a targeted server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Trusted CA Compromise (or Vulnerable CA):** The attacker either needs to compromise a CA to issue malicious cert or exploit a vulnerable CA to issue a cert with NULL bytes.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic to perform a MitM attack.
*   **Knowledge of Target Domain:** The attacker needs knowledge of the target domain name to create a certificate that resembles a legitimate one by using the domain name followed by a NULL byte and a malicious domain.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability affects various versions of Ruby including 1.8.x, 1.9.x, and 2.0.x before specific patch levels.
*   Patches for the issue involve correctly extracting the full hostname from the certificate, while ensuring null bytes are handled appropriately.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `ext/openssl/lib/openssl/ssl-internal.rb` file which implements the SSL certificate verification logic.
*   Red Hat, Debian, and Ubuntu security advisories also cover this vulnerability.
