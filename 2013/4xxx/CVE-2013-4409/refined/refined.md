{
  "CVE-2013-4409": {
    "Description": "An eval() vulnerability exists in Python Software Foundation Djblets 0.7.21 and Beanbag Review Board before 1.7.15 when parsing JSON requests.",
    "Root cause": "The djblets library uses `eval()` to restore object representations from JSON data, which allows for arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unsanitized input passed to eval()"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could construct a JSON request containing malicious python code that would be executed on the server, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution within the server's process.",
    "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted JSON requests sent to a vulnerable server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service and craft a specific JSON payload.",
        "Affected components": [
      "Djblets",
          "Review Board"
    ],
    "Resolution": "The vulnerability was addressed by replacing the use of `eval()` with `literal_eval()` in Djblets versions for Python 2.6 and later. `literal_eval()` only allows the evaluation of valid Python literals, preventing arbitrary code execution.  For platforms running Python 2.5 or earlier, the code will fallback to the less secure `eval()` routine, thus upgrading to a more recent version of Python is highly recommended."
