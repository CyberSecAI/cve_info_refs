Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-4579:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an improper implementation of MAC address spoofing in certain Atheros wireless drivers (specifically `ath9k_htc`). When a user spoofs their MAC address, the driver doesn't update the main hardware MAC address register. Instead, it uses a "mask" to identify which bits of the incoming packets should be matched against the original MAC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate MAC Address Spoofing:** The driver does not properly overwrite the main hardware MAC address when a spoofed MAC address is set.
*   **BSSID Masking Flaw:** The method of using a mask and the original MAC address to acknowledge packets creates a way to discover the original address bit-by-bit by flipping bits in the spoofed address and observing if ACKs are sent.
*   **Privacy Breach:** The ability to discover the original MAC address undermines the privacy intentions of MAC address spoofing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of Anonymity:** An attacker can uncover the device's true MAC address, enabling tracking and de-anonymization.
*   **Virtual Interface Linking:** Multiple virtual interfaces created by a user can be linked back to the same device/user, even if using randomly assigned MAC addresses.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless Packet Injection:** The attacker must be able to inject packets towards the vulnerable device.
*   **Targeted MAC Address Manipulation:** The attacker needs to send specifically crafted packets with manipulated versions of the spoofed MAC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Network Presence:** The attacker needs to be on the same wireless network or within radio range of the vulnerable device.
*   **Packet Injection Ability:** The attacker needs to be able to inject raw Wi-Fi packets into the air.
*   **Active Attacker:** This attack is active. The attacker is required to send specially crafted packets to the victim device.
*   **Knowledge of Spoofed MAC:** The attacker needs to know the spoofed MAC address of a target.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability primarily affects the `ath9k_htc` driver, commonly used for Atheros USB Wi-Fi dongles.
*   The original `ath9k` driver does not appear to have the same issue due to correctly updating the hardware MAC.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is available, written in Python using Scapy, to uncover original MAC addresses.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Linux kernel version 3.8.13.16 and above.
*   The exploit was successful on Debian 7.2.0, Kali 1.0.5 and Ubuntu 13.10, using `AR7010` and `AR9271` chipsets.
*   The provided Ubuntu Security Notices confirm this vulnerability impacts `linux-ti-omap4` (USN-2134-1, USN-2139-1, USN-2141-1), `linux-lts-raring` (USN-2136-1), `linux` (USN-2117-1, USN-2133-1, USN-2138-1), and `linux-lts-saucy` (USN-2135-1).
