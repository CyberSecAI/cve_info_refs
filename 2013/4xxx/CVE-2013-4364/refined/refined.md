Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `oo-analytics-export` and `oo-analytics-import` utilities in OpenShift use predictable filenames in the `/tmp` directory when exporting and importing data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable temporary file names:** Using predictable filenames in `/tmp` allows for potential race conditions and unauthorized access or manipulation of the temporary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The description doesn't detail the specific impact but implies that the vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of exported/imported data.
- Because of the predictable filename, a malicious local user could potentially overwrite the temporary file before the legitimate process accesses it. This could result in the process reading or writing to an attacker controlled file which could lead to a variety of exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker would need local access to the system where the OpenShift broker is running.
- **Race Condition:** Exploitation involves a race condition where an attacker creates a file with the same predictable name before the legitimate process does, thus potentially forcing the process to read from a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local user account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the same machine where the vulnerable OpenShift components are running. The user must be untrusted.
- **Ability to create files in `/tmp`:** The attacker must be able to create files and win the race condition to create the files before the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**
- The bug report states that this vulnerability is not planned to be addressed in future updates for OpenShift Enterprise 2.1, as the broker and node should be installed on separate systems, meaning there should not be untrusted local users. The resolution is marked as "WONTFIX".
- The description is very succinct, and implies the vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data. The exact type of unauthorized access or manipulation is not specified.
- The bug report provides more details on the affected component (`oo-analytics-export` and `oo-analytics-import`) and the vulnerability's location (`/tmp`) than the CVE description placeholder.
