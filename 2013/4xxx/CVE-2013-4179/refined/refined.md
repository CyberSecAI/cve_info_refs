{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way OpenStack Nova handles XML requests, specifically within the security group extension. The `minidom.parseString` function is used directly to parse the XML body of the request. This function is vulnerable to XML entity expansion attacks, which can lead to excessive resource consumption and potential denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe XML parsing using `minidom.parseString`.",
      "Lack of proper XML validation against a schema.",
       "Vulnerable to XML entity expansion attacks such as 'billion laughs' and 'quadratic blowup'"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted XML requests to the Nova API server, causing it to consume excessive resources (CPU and memory), potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) and even a crash of the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted XML request to the Nova API server."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to the Nova API server.",
      "Knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoints."
     ],
     "details": "The vulnerability exists in the security group extension of OpenStack Nova, where the `minidom.parseString` is used to parse XML request bodies. This can be exploited by injecting XML entities into request, leading to resource exhaustion. Specifically, the code in `nova/nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib/security_groups.py` was identified as vulnerable. The vulnerability was present in the Grizzly release but not in Folsom. The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `minidom.parseString` with  `xmlutil.safe_minidom_parse_string` which prevents the expansion of XML entities, thereby mitigating the denial of service vulnerability."
