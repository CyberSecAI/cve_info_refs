So according to
<http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html>
Google is a CVE Numbering Authority but I can't find a CVE in google
(irony?) for this so I guess they missed it. Please use CVE-2013-4204
for this issue.

Subject: CVE request: XSS in Google Web Toolkit (GWT)

I note that with the release of Google Web Toolkit (GWT) 2.5.1, a security flaw has been resolved:

<http://www.gwtproject.org/release-notes.html#Release_Notes_2_5_1_RC1> ("Security Fixes")

The release notes state:
Fixed an XSS vulnerability in html files used by GWTTestCase (patch). These files will only be included in a GWT app if it depends on the JUnit module. Despite the fix, this is not recommended.

The patch is here:
<https://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/detail?r=11385>

I have reproduced this flaw and can confirm it is reflected XSS. I have previously contacted security@...gle asking for CVE IDs for GWT flaws, but never received a response. Please assign a CVE ID to this flaw.

Thanks

```
* [2.5.1](#Release_Notes_2_5_1) March 9, 2013
* [2.5.1 (RC1)](#Release_Notes_2_5_1_RC1) February 5, 2013
```

```
## Release Notes for 2.5.1 (RC1)

GWT 2.5.1 is a maintenance release including many bugfixes and
minor improvements since GWT 2.5.

### Changes since 2.5.0

#### Security Fixes

* Fixed an XSS vulnerability in html files used by GWTTestCase [(patch)](https://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/detail?r=11385).
  These files will only be included in a GWT app if it depends on the
  JUnit module. Despite the fix, this is not recommended.

```
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an XSS vulnerability present in HTML files that are used by `GWTTestCase`. These HTML files are included in a GWT application if it uses the JUnit module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to:
    - Stealing sensitive information (session cookies, etc.)
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTML files used in `GWTTestCase`, which are part of the JUnit testing module in Google Web Toolkit (GWT).
- The vulnerability is triggered when a GWT application using JUnit module renders the vulnerable HTML files, likely by injecting malicious script into the HTML during test execution or rendering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious script into a vulnerable field or parameter within the vulnerable HTML files used by the `GWTTestCase`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to GWT applications that use the JUnit module.
- The GWT team recommends not using these vulnerable HTML files, even with the provided fix.
- The vulnerability was addressed in GWT 2.5.1.
