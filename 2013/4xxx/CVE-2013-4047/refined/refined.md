- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for script injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Script injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could steal or manipulate user sessions and cookies, impersonate legitimate users, view or alter user records, and perform transactions as that user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must trick a user into clicking a crafted link containing malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious link and trick a user into clicking it. They do not necessarily need prior access to the application.
