  "CVE-2013-4288": {
    "description": "The polkit unix-process subject for authorization is racy. It depended on the (PID, startup_time) pair to be passed to polkit which then used /proc/PID/status to find out the UID the process belongs to. Meanwhile, the process could have started a suid or pkexec process, changing the euid and/or uid at will. The startup_time does not protect here, as its not changed across an execve().",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The polkit unix-process subject for authorization is racy because it relies on the (PID, startup_time) pair which can be changed via a setuid or pkexec process.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race condition in UID lookup using PID and start time.",
        "Insecure use of /proc/PID/status to determine UID, which can change.",
         "PID and startup time are not atomically passed along the message subject to polkit authorization.",
        "PID authorization is deprecated."
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation by bypassing polkit authorization.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local attacker exploits the race condition to change the UID of a process after it is checked by polkit, but before it is granted privileges.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local access to the system with the ability to execute programs and use pkexec or similar tools."

      "polkit",
      "libvirt",

      "patches": [
        "polkit patch implements a pid,start-time,uid syntax for non-racy pkcheck calls.",
        "libpolkit-gobject-1 API changes, deprecating polkit_unix_process_new() and using polkit_unix_process_new_for_owner() instead.",
        "dbus API changes to accept system-bus-name as subject instead of pid."
      ],
     "additional_notes":[
         "The vulnerability is related to the usage of insecure polkit DBUS API and how it uses process IDs and startup times to determine the UID of a process. This information is not atomically passed and can be manipulated.",
        "The vulnerability can be exploited via applications that use polkit for authorization, potentially leading to privilege escalation."
