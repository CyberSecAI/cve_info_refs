{
  "CVE-2013-4302": {
    "Description": "MediaWiki allowed anti-CSRF tokens to be accessed via JSONP in several API modules.",
    "Root cause": "Several API modules incorrectly allowed access to anti-CSRF tokens via JSONP.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of sensitive information (CSRF tokens)",
      "Improper access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially gain access to anti-CSRF tokens, which could be used to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of other users via CSRF attacks.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "By making requests to vulnerable MediaWiki API modules with a JSONP callback parameter specified, an attacker can access anti-CSRF tokens.",
        "This is performed remotely via HTTP requests."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a vulnerable MediaWiki instance and must be able to trick a user to visit a malicious website or link, to perform a CSRF attack using leaked tokens.",
     "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerable API modules allowed access to anti-CSRF tokens when a JSONP callback parameter was present in the request.",
        "The fix involved preventing access to CSRF tokens via JSONP.",
        "This vulnerability affects MediaWiki versions prior to 1.15.5-2squeeze6 (squeeze), 1.19.5-1+deb7u1 (wheezy), and 1.19.8+dfsg-1 (jessie/sid).",
         "The issue is related to bug 49090 in the MediaWiki bug tracker"
