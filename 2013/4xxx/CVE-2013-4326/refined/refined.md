{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in rtkit's communication with polkit. rtkit was using a D-Bus API to communicate with polkit that relied on the process ID (PID) and startup time of a process to determine its UID. However, this information could be changed before polkit performed authorization checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "TOCTOU race condition",
      "Insecure use of D-Bus API",
       "Improper authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "Local attackers could potentially gain realtime rights that they should not have, leading to privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
        "Exploiting TOCTOU race condition in rtkit's communication with polkit through a D-Bus API."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local access to the system",
      "Ability to exploit timing-related issues to manipulate process attributes before polkit's checks are done."
