  "CVE-2013-4271": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Restlet: remote code execution due to insecure deserialization",
    "details": "A flaw was found in the way Restlet handled deserialization. Restlet applications which use ObjectRepresentation to map HTTP request data directly to an object will deserialize arbitrary user-provided serialized data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending on the deserialization logic of these classes.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0",
       "Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0",
       "Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Insecure deserialization of user-provided data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The Restlet framework deserializes arbitrary user-provided serialized data when using ObjectRepresentation to map HTTP request data directly to an object.",
     "This deserialization process can trigger execution of deserialization methods in any serializable class on the server."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a crafted serialized object via an HTTP request to a Restlet application.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Restlet application and craft a malicious serialized object."
