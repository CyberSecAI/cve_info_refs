{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference occurs in mod_cache when processing a request with a missing hostname, specifically within the `cache_invalidate` function when calling `strcmp` on `r->parsed_uri.hostname` and `location_uri.hostname` without proper null checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Lack of proper null checks when accessing struct members"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious HTTP server could cause a crash (denial of service) in a caching forward proxy configuration. This would only be a denial of service if using a threaded MPM.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious HTTP server sending a response with missing hostname, targeting a caching forward proxy"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the origin server responses when Apache httpd is configured as a forward proxy and caching is enabled."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "2.4.6"
  ],
  "fixed_versions": [
    "2.4.7"
  ],
   "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises because the `cache_invalidate` function in `cache_storage.c` directly uses the hostname of the parsed URI without verifying if the hostname exists. If a malicious server response lacks a hostname, a NULL pointer dereference occurs during the `strcmp` operation, causing the httpd child process to crash."
