| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=998227#c0)  Michael S.    2013-08-18 12:17:28 UTC  ``` Since version 1.2 of ansible, failed run ( due to connexion errors, or config error ) are listed into /var/tmp/ansible/$script_name.yml , with $script_name being the script name used ( or rather the playbook, in ansible linguo )  There is no verification on the file or directory here, and /var/tmp is world writable.   Worst, due to it using a subdirectory under /var/tmp, some symlink protection may not apply ( not tested ). For example, if i create a directory /var/tmp/ansible with owner misc:users and a symlink to a file of joe, the kernel would permit to follow since the symlink and owner of the directory match. This permit to erase file content among others. I am not sure what kind of specific attack could be made by injecting ip and hostname in a specific file, but I am sure this exist.  Code is on  <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/playbook/__init__.py#L480>  Upstream was not notified yet AFAIK.  I do have a patch almost ready that do : - verify the permission/owner of directory  - create a unique directory derived from username ( so predictable ) with proper permission if doesn't exist  I just need to review and test.  The current code do cope with lack of permission on the directory so even if someone create a directory in advance, this will be handled "gracefully" ( I think a message would be better )   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=998227#c1)  Michael S.    2013-08-18 12:52:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 787776](attachment.cgi?id=787776&action=diff "patch to use a different directory and check the permission after") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=787776&action=edit "patch to use a different directory and check the permission after") patch to use a different directory and check the permission after  Here is a patch that should fix the problem, I quickly tested and seems to be resilient enough. I may have forgot something about symlinks however, so a review would be welcome.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=998227#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-20 16:07:00 UTC  ``` Why not use tempfile.mkdtemp?  <http://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mkdtemp>  So something like this:  #!/usr/bin/env python import tempfile import os f = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix='foo', dir='/tmp') try:     os.rename(f, '/tmp/foo') except OSError:     print 'Unable to rename directory!'     os.rmdir(f)  Probably better exception handling to see if the /tmp/foo directory is valid and owned by that user first, but for the actual creation, mkdtemp() will do so securely and os.rename will do so atomically.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=998227#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-20 16:15:03 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Michael Scherer for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=998227#c4)  Michael S.    2013-08-20 20:27:17 UTC  ```  I can hardly see how/where there is a need to create the directory in a atomic fashion in the first place, and since check (if the directory /tmp/foo exist and is suitable ) and rename would not be atomic, then we would have a race condition.  If someone create it between the time I check and the time I create the dir, the makedir will fail, and so directory is not used. And the owner wil be incorrect, since user cannot make chown to give file ( unless people have been playing with CAP_CHOWN but i will count that as "unlikely" )   Since the code is supposed to be able to fail, it is better to use this possibility in case of problem. But we will see the opinion of upstream.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=998227#c5)  Kevin Fenzi    2013-08-21 17:38:29 UTC  ``` Upstream release with fixes announced:   <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-project/UVDYW0HGcNg>  Can we unembargo and setup updates bugs links for the updates?   Thanks.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=998227#c6)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-21 17:59:14 UTC  ```  Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 999621](show_bug.cgi?id=999621 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4259 CVE-2013-4260 ansible: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 999626](show_bug.cgi?id=999626 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2013-4260 ansible: predictible filename used for failed result in world writable directory [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=998227#c7)  Fedora Update System    2013-08-30 22:58:34 UTC  ``` ansible-1.2.3-2.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.
