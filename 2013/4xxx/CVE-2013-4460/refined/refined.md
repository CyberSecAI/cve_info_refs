Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `account_sponsor_page.php` file of MantisBT.
*   Project names were not properly sanitized before being displayed on the `account_sponsor_page.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code within the project names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject JavaScript that will be executed in the browsers of users visiting the `account_sponsor_page.php`.
*   **Potential for Account Takeover/Data Theft:** The injected JavaScript could potentially be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions that compromise the user's security or the application's integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Project Name:** The attacker crafts a project name containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Page Visit:** When a user visits the `account_sponsor_page.php`, the unsanitized project name is displayed, and the malicious JavaScript is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Project Manager or Higher Access:** The attacker needs to have project manager or administrator privileges in MantisBT, as this level of access is required to edit project names.
*   **Access to MantisBT:** The attacker needs to have access to the MantisBT instance and the ability to create or modify projects.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was present in MantisBT versions 1.0.0 up to 1.2.15 inclusive.
* The fix was implemented in version 1.2.16.
* The fix involved using the `string_display_line` function, which likely handles the sanitization of project names before display.
* Patches were backported to the 1.2.x branch.
* The vulnerability was identified by Roland Becker, a MantisBT developer.
