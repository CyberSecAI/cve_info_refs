Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `UpdateDomainControllerServlet` of HP PCM Plus.
- The servlet fails to properly sanitize the `adCert` argument.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input (`adCert` argument).
- Lack of input validation.
- This allows for the upload of malicious files, specifically a `.jsp` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the vulnerable server.
- The attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated network access to the `UpdateDomainControllerServlet`.
- Exploitation requires sending a crafted request to the servlet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable HP PCM Plus server.
- No authentication is required for exploitation.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests to include malicious `.jsp` file in the `adCert` parameter.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a remote code execution issue caused by a lack of input sanitization in the HP PCM Plus `UpdateDomainControllerServlet`. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can upload a malicious JSP file, leading to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
