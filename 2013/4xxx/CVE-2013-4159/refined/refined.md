{
  "Root cause": "The ctdb daemon creates predictable files and directories in /tmp.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Use of predictable file names in /tmp",
    "Creation of temporary files in /tmp with insecure permissions",
        "Use of /tmp for socket files"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities using symbolic links or other methods to overwrite arbitrary files, potentially leading to privilege escalation, denial of service, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Local symlink attack",
        "Manipulation of temporary files and directories"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the system"
}
