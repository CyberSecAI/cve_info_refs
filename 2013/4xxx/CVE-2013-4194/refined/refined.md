Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4194:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to how Plone, a content management system, presents error messages in its `wysiwyg` (What You See Is What You Get) component. Specifically, the error messages were not properly sanitized when handling a specially crafted URL request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **File System Path Exposure:** The core vulnerability is that the error messages displayed within the `wysiwyg` component, when encountering a malformed request, unintentionally revealed the file system paths of the Plone installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain knowledge of the server's directory structure and file locations, which might help them in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted URL:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific URL that, when processed by the Plone `wysiwyg` component, would trigger an error message revealing file system paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted URL, meaning no prior authentication or user privilege is needed.

**Summary:**
CVE-2013-4194 is an information disclosure vulnerability where a remote attacker can expose file system paths by sending a specially crafted URL to the Plone CMS, due to improper handling of error messages in the `wysiwyg` component.
