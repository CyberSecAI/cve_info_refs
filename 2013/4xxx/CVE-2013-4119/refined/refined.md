Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of security handles within the NLA (Network Level Authentication) implementation of FreeRDP. Specifically, the `sec` pointer was not being invalidated after its creation. This allowed access to the underlying pointers without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core issue is a potential use-after-free condition related to the security handle (`credssp->context`). If the client disconnects before authentication is complete, the code attempts to access the `credssp->context`  after it may have already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A client disconnecting before authentication completion could lead to a segfault on the server side, effectively causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Client:** A malicious client can trigger the vulnerability by disconnecting at the right time during the authentication handshake (before NLA is finished).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate an RDP connection to a vulnerable FreeRDP server. No special privileges are required as far as this analysis goes.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is corrected by the following actions:
- **Invalidation of security handle:** In `libfreerdp/core/nla.c`, the `SecInvalidateHandle(&credssp->context)` is called to ensure that the context is properly invalidated after creation
- **Checks for valid handles:** In `winpr/libwinpr/sspi/sspi.c` functions `sspi_SecureHandleGetLowerPointer` and `sspi_SecureHandleGetUpperPointer` now include a check using `SecIsValidHandle(handle)`
- **Freeing context**: After client authentication in `libfreerdp/core/peer.c` `credssp_free(rdp->nego->transport->credssp)` is called to free the context after usage. Also `credssp_free(transport->credssp)` is called when authentication fails in `libfreerdp/core/transport.c`

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that the fix was part of a larger set of changes in FreeRDP, which included hardening and other security-related updates.
- The vulnerability was fixed in a commit `0773bb9303d24473fe1185d85a424dfe159aff53` and was included in a snapshot `freerdp-1.1.0-beta+2013071101.tar.gz`
