Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4193:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper enforcement of immutable settings on content edit forms within the Plone CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The system fails to properly enforce immutability, allowing for the possibility of manipulating form fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can use a specially crafted URL to hide specific fields on content edit forms. This could potentially lead an authenticated user to submit altered forms that would otherwise be considered invalid, thus leading to data modification or corruption
*   **Non-Persistent Impact:** The field hiding is non-persistent, meaning the changes are not saved to the underlying system or data structure itself. This does not change the impact which can lead to data modification/corruption

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted URL:** An attacker crafts a specific URL that, when accessed, modifies the display of the content edit form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated (anonymous) users
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a valid user into accessing the crafted URL, or they may be able to use it themselves if they are an authenticated user

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-4193 allows anonymous users to hide fields on Plone content edit forms by crafting a specific URL, potentially leading to data manipulation by authenticated users who may not realize they are submitting an altered form.
