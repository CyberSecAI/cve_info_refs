# VLC + ABC parsing seems to be a CTF challenge

Checking the [libmodplug](http://modplug-xmms.sourceforge.net/ "Libmodplug") source code with 0vercl0k some years ago, we gave up on the abc file parsing because it was too indigest and we were too lazy…

For fun, last week, I decided to take the bull by the horns.

## ABC soundsystem !

The abc format is defined as “*the text-based music notation system”* it rings like midi files and so has a complex syntaxe (close to the musician tablature).

> ```
> T:Sadi Moma
> C:Trad.
> M:7/4
> L:1/8
> F:http://www.gnu.org/music/sadi-moma.abc
> Z:Joakim Olsson

> G3 G2 G2|D3 D4|E7|]
> ```

More abc definition and exemple can be found on <http://abcnotation.com/>

Anyway, libmodplug is the library that allows reading this kind of file format and is shipped with VLC.
You can check all this marvelous 5189 lines of code [here](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp "here").

## Complexity == bugs

A lot of crash can be found just by fuzzing this file format, 0vercl0k has quickly tried that with Radamsa and the results were a lot of “divide by zero” and others non exploitable bugs.

Happily reading the code I found one integer overflow leading to heap overflow and one other heap overflow.

The first one is in [abc\_set\_parts()](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L1812 "abc_set_parts") that you can trigger using the [“P:”](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L3974 "\"P:\"") case. This function allows the usage of a kind of compression syntax as explain in a comment [L1833](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L1833 "comment") : *// decode constructs like “((AB)2.(CD)2)3.(AB)E2” to “ABABCDCDABABCDCDABABCDCDABEE”*

It starts to count how many bytes it will need to allocate before uncompress the string.

```
j=0;
k=0;
for( i=0; p[i] && p[i] != '%'; i++ ) {
 if( isupper(p[i]) ) {
  j++;
 }
 if( isdigit(p[i]) ) {
  n=abc_getnumber(p+i,&k);
  if( k == 0 )
   k = 1;
  if( p[i-1] == ')' )
   j *= k; // never mind multiple parens, just take the worst case
  else
   j += k-1;
  i += n-1;
 }
}
q = (char *)_mm_calloc(h, j+1, sizeof(char)); // enough storage for the worst case
```

[abc\_getnumber()](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L1620 "abc_getnumber()") converts a decimal string into integer so it’s easy to make **j** equals to **0xffffffff**and so allocate 0 byte in \_mm\_calloc function.

A big problem here is the charset defined [line 1825](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L1825 "line 1825") : “*ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ().0123456789 ”* so it seems difficult to successfully exploit this bug with only upper alphanumerical chars.

The second one occurs in [abc\_MIDI\_drum()](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L3201 "abc_MIDI_drum()") and [abc\_MIDI\_gchord()](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L3250 "abc_MIDI_gchord()").
In this two cases, bytes are copied in a fixed 80 bytes buffer in [ABCHANDLE structure](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L181 "ABCHANDLE") until the copied byte is no longer in a charset.

Again in this case, the charset limits the impact of our overflow. (“fbcz0123456789ghijGHIJ” for gchord and  “dz0123456789” for drum).

Then I started to cry, thinking the only way would be to exploit heap allocator using house of poney technique with this limited charset…

## CTF begins o/

Some other path (maybe to a successfull exploit) appears before attacking the allocator.

Indeed, we overflow a buffer in the middle of [ABCHANDLE structure](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L181 "ABCHANDLE") so there are some interesting pointers we may control.

```
ABCTRACK *tp, *tpc, *tpr;
```

And if we look closely to [abc\_MIDI\_drum()](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L3201 "abc_MIDI_drum()") it actually appears possible to write any byte we want.

It firstly counts how many ‘d’ there is in your string, then writes integers from your string following the ‘d’ separated by space converted by [abc\_getnumber()](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L1620 "abc_getnumber()") in h->drumins then h->drumvol (that are fixed 80 bytes buffer too)  !!! Add to this the fact that it writes a ‘1’ after each ‘d’ it copies and that makes this exploit exactly like a CTF brainfuck challenge :).

## Brainfuck 1

Using this funny feature, it is possible to control the three pointers without breaking heap structure.

To do this we need to calculate the space between the drum buffer and the tp pointer.

```
char drum[80]; // last setting for drum
char drumins[80]; // last setting for drum
char drumvol[80]; // last setting for drum
uint32_t barticks;
//parse variables, declared here to avoid parameter pollution
int abcchordvol, abcchordprog, abcbassvol, abcbassprog;
int ktrans;
int drumon, gchordon, droneon;
int dronegm, dronepitch[2], dronevol[2];
ABCTRACK *tp, *tpc, *tpr;
```

80\*3+4\*14 = 296

So we write 152 ‘d’ that will become 152 ‘d1’ == 304 bytes  to overflow tp and tpc pointer.

But, after that, it writes the numbers following your ‘d’ chain after 80 bytes of ‘d1’ as many time it finds ‘d1’. So to prevent stopping the numbers copy, we have to write 152/2=76 ’99 48′ that will fill the drumins buffer with ‘d1′ (99+1==’d’ and 48+1==’1′) and then continue the number copy in the drumvol buffer.

This time no incrementation occurs so we will write 76 ‘100 49’.

Now the pt address is equal to ‘d1d1’.

drumvol buffer is placed 296-(80\*2)=136 bytes before the pt pointer.

So, to control the pt pointer, we have to write.

```
'd'*152+' 99 48'*76+' 100 49'*68+' 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 100 49 100 49'
```

So pt = 0x04030201

## Brainfuck 2

Now the challenge is to find a path where the h->pt pointer is used with some data we control and achieve an arbitrary write.

In every abc syntaxe possibilities, it seems to be a way !

Two functions must be avoid : abc\_locate\_track() and abc\_add\_event() that rewrite tp pointer or write non controlled data in it.

When you begin a line with a ‘+’ it is possible to call [abc\_parse\_decorations()](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L2298 "abc_parse_decorations()") without calling this two functions.

It’s the line 2316 that interest us “*tp->volume = vol;”*

As we control tp pointer, vol value will be writed at the address we want ! But unfortunately, vol value can only be 0, 1, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 100, 105, 120, 125 or 127.

## POC Exploitation

Almost perfect ! We have an arbitrary write (almost) that we can call as many times as we want.

What can we do with this… I didn’t find any idea to bypass ASLR nor NX mitigation so I at least focused on a POC on the VLC 2.0.7 under windows XP without ASLR nor NX (that’s just a CTF-like challenge after all ^^).

The idea is to rewrite the strcpy address in the Import Table that we can call line 4159 “*strcpy(buf,m\_szNames[0]);*” with buffers we control. If we can convert strcpy into a pop + ret, we win !

To find this, we tried on each strcpy address byte, every bytes we can from [abc\_parse\_decorations()](https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L2298 "abc_parse_decorations()").

And that’s worked !

## To resume + POC

To quickly resume, using overflow we can overwrite an ABCTRACK structure pointer in the ABCHANDLE structure then write some few bytes in the vol variable of ABCTRACK. We choose to change the strcpy pointer in the import table into a ‘pop + ret’ gadget. Then we change the title triggering the false strcpy and controling the EIP.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
