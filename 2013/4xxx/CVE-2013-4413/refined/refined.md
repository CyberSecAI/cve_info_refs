Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4413:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `wicked` Ruby gem's improper handling of user-supplied step parameters in the URL. Specifically, the gem did not sanitize or validate the input, allowing specially crafted URL strings containing escaped slash characters (`%2e`) to bypass intended path restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The core weakness is a path traversal vulnerability. By using escaped dot-slash sequences (`%2e%2f` or `%2e%2e%2f`), an attacker could navigate outside the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The gem failed to properly sanitize and validate the step parameter provided in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A successful exploit would enable an attacker to read any file on the server that the webserver process had permissions to access. This could include configuration files, source code, or sensitive data.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The primary impact is the disclosure of potentially sensitive information, leading to further attacks or unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the application, including a malicious step parameter in the URL.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URL by adding `%2e` sequences to traverse directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application utilizing the vulnerable `wicked` gem.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft the malicious URL strings with escaped slashes.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Details (from provided content):**

*   The vulnerability was present in all versions of the gem prior to 1.0.1.
*   Version 1.0.1 contains the fix, which includes sanitizing the step parameter using `ERB::Util.url_encode`.
*   The fix prevents path traversal by encoding the provided step and ensures it can only access the intended views.
*   Integration tests were added to verify the fix and prevent regressions. These tests specifically attempt to access `database.yml` and an arbitrary system file (`/usr/share/dict/words`) and confirm that these files are not accessible.
