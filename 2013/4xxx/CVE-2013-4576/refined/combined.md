# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Nmap Network Scanning

[![Cover of Nmap Network Scanning](https://nmap.org/book/cover/nns-whole-cover-326x200.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20)

*Nmap Network Scanning* is
the official guide to the [Nmap Security Scanner](https://nmap.org/),
a free and open source utility used by millions of people for
network discovery, administration, and security auditing. From
explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing
low-level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers, this book suits
all levels of security and networking professionals. A 42-page reference
guide documents every Nmap feature and option, while the rest of the
book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve
real-world tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on
the wire.

Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks
with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided
for common uses such as taking network inventory, penetration testing,
detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm
outbreaks. Nmap runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Nmap's original author, Gordon “Fyodor” Lyon, wrote
this book to share everything he has learned about network scanning
during more than a decade of Nmap development. It was briefly the #1
selling computer book on Amazon
([screenshot](https://nmap.org/book/img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).
The book is in English, though [several translations](#translations) are in the works.

Key facts: The ISBN is 978-0-9799587-1-7 (ISBN-10 is 0-9799587-1-7)
and suggested retail prices are $49.95 in the U.S., £34.95 in
the U.K., and €39.95 in Europe. Like most books, it costs less
online (as little as $32.97 - see [purchasing
options](#purchase)). It is 468 pages long. The official release date was
January 1, 2009, though Amazon managed to beat that by a couple weeks.

About half of the content is [available in the
free online edition](toc.html). Chapters exclusive to the print edition
include “Detecting and Subverting Firewalls and Intrusion
Detection Systems”, “Optimizing Nmap Performance”,
“Port Scanning Techniques and Algorithms”, “Host
Discovery (Ping Scanning)”, and more.
The *solution* selections which provide detailed
instructions on the best way to solve common networking tasks are also
exclusive to the printed book. The
[final table of contents](toc.pdf) and [cover art](cover/) are available.

## Updates

Several people asked whether Nmap Network Scanning
is still up to date, particularly after the release of [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/). The good news is that virtually all of the
content remains accurate. But we have added some new features and
NSE scripts which aren't yet documented in NNS.

For a comprehensive and completely current view of Nmap, I
recommend reading Nmap Network Scanning first, then read all the
changelog entries we've produced since the book was finished. The
book is completely up-to-date with Nmap 4.76. So after (or before)
you're done reading Nmap Network Scanning, visit
the [Nmap changelog](https://nmap.org/changelog.html) and search
in the file for “Nmap 4.76”. Read each item upward from there
(scrolling backward) until you get to the top.
## Translations

We would love to make the Nmap book more accessible by working with foreign publishers who will translate and distribute it in their markets. If you are such a publisher or know a good one to suggest, please let me know. Here are the current or in-progress translations:

* [![Cover of 'Nmap - Netzwerke scannen, analysieren und absichern'](xlate/nmap-opensourcepress-de-cover-95x125.jpg)](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270)
  [Nmap - Netzwerke scannen, analysieren und absichern](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270) is the German translation by Open Source Press, released in June 2009 at a list price of €39.90. Translation was performed expertly by Dinu Gherman. They have contributed back their [Nmap Reference Guide German translation](/man/de/).* [![Cover of 'Exame de Redes com NMAP'](xlate/nmap-ciencia-moderna-cover-95x125.jpg)](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778)
    [Exame de Redes com NMAP](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778) is the Brazilian Portuguese translation by Editora Ciência Moderna. Translation was done by [Angico](http://www.angico.org) and release was August 26, 2009. You can [buy it directly from the publisher](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778) for R$95.20.* [![Cover of '엔맵 네트워크 스캐닝'](xlate/nmap-acornpub-ko-cover-95x125.png)](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/nmap)
      The official Korean translation, entitled [엔맵 네트워크 스캐닝](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/nmap), has been created by [Acorn Publishing Co](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/). The release date was November 16, 2009 at a list price of KRW 35,000.

## Current status

**August 26:** Many Barnes & Noble stores now stock NNS, as described in the [purchasing section](#purchase).

**August 26:** Editora Ciência Moderna released the Brazilian Portuguese translation. See [translations](#translations).

**July 31:** Held a [book signing](http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0426.html) at Defcon. All copies sold out in 3 hours.

**July 17:** Added [Updates](#updates) section.

**July 16:** [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/) released!

**June 11:** The German translation from Open Source Press is [now available](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270). They also contributed back a [German translation of the Nmap Reference Guide.](/man/de/)

**January 30:** Today the Amazon price is back to $32.97 after several days at $37.96. I hope they keep it at this price!

**January 23:** Amazon has raised their prices, so I've added [more purchase options](#purchase), though the cheapest is still only about $4.50 less than Amazon when domestic shipping is taken into account.

**January 21:** NNS receives a [glowing review](http://netsecurity.about.com/od/14/gr/NMapBook.htm) from About.Com.

**January 19:** Translation contracts have been signed for Korean and Brazilian Portuguese editions of Nmap Network Scanning! See the new [Translations](#translations) section for details.

**January 5:** [Acorn Publishing Co.](http://www.acornpub.co.kr) will be publishing the official Korean translation of Nmap Network Scanning! Release is expected in August.

**January 4:** NNS is finally in stock at [Amazon U.K.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0979958717) and [Amazon Germany](http://www.amazon.de/dp/0979958717). Amazon Canada currently still has a [1-3 week backlog](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0979958717).

**December 31, 2008:** NNS makes Richard Bejtlich's TaoSecurity [Top Books of 2008](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/best-book-bejtlich-read-in-2008.html) list.

**December 29, 2008:** A new [Information Week review](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/12/nmap_network_sc.html) is one of the best so far!

**December 19, 2008:** The book is [back in stock on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) after a 10 day dry spell!

**December 10, 2008:** Amazon has now indexed this book as part of
their “Search Inside” program. While Amazon intends this
as a marketing tool for prospective buyers, it can be even more useful
for folks who already own the book. While we're proud of our index,
Search Inside can help find more obscure terms or combinations of them. You can try this out by visiting
the [Amazon
NNS page](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20), scrolling down to the Search Inside box, and typing in a
term such as Trinity or Microsoft.

**December 9, 2008:** Sales were so high that Amazon ran out of stock in the US, UK, and Germany. They say it may take a week or more to ship. Amazon still offers a great price, but for those who can't wait, I've added a [purchasing options](#purchase) section. It includes vendor such as A1Books and Barnes & Noble with NNS in stock now.

**December 9, 2008:** Nmap Network Scanning sales surge further to become #1 on [Amazon's computer book best seller list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20)! Since we can't keep that rank forever, I took a [screenshot](img/nns-top-seller-471x512.png) ([larger version](img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).

**December 8, 2008:**
An [excellent
Slashdot review](http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/12/08/1443223.shtml) causes NNS to rocket into [Amazon's top 10 computer books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20).

**December 6, 2008:** Amazon has [fixed the price](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) so it is now $33.71 rather than $49.95. NNS is **in stock and shipping**!

**December 2, 2008:** The book has [an initial page on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20). You can pre-order it now, but Amazon is showing a pre-order price of $49.95. I expect the price to be about $33 when Amazon starts shipping it within a week or two. Amazon will probably refund the difference per their "Pre-order price guarantee", but it might be safer to wait. Book seller BOOKSPLUSMORESTUFF claims to have the book "in stock" on Amazon for $53.94 including shipping. That may or may not be true.

**November 14, 2008:** The book is finished and submitted to the
printer! The official release date is January 1, 2009, though our
goal is to make it available on Amazon and other retailers by
mid-December. To be notified upon publication, join the
low-traffic [nmap-hackers
announcement mailing list](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce).

**September 15, 2008:** The Black Hat/Defcon pre-release was a huge
success! All of the Defcon copies were snapped up as soon as the
vendor room opened, and the Black Hat copies also sold out in the
first morning of the conference. Thanks to Bill Pollock of No Starch
Press and Dave Hemsath of BreakPoint Books for handling sales. My
conference presentation video and audio have
been [posted
online](http://insecure.org/presentations/) just in time for
the [Nmap
4.75 release](http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2008/0004.html) which includes the new features discussed in that
presentation.

**July 25, 2008**: Defcon Pre-Release announced! We have decided to
launch the book with a limited pre-release version at Defcon 16.

**July 1, 2008**: After years of work, Nmap Network Scanning is nearing completion. You can browse the [current table of contents](toc.pdf) to see what is coming. We recently conducted a test-printing of some prepublication copies:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1043327#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-16 00:31:32 UTC  ``` It was found that GnuPG was vulnerable to side-channel attacks via acoustic cryptanalysis. An attacker in close range to a target system that is decrypting ciphertexts could possibly use this flaw to recover the RSA secret key from that system.  This issue affects GnuPG version 1.4. It does not affect the gnupg2 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and Fedora.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1043327#c9)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-18 05:52:35 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Werner Koch of GnuPG upstream for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Genkin, Shamir, and Tromer as the original reporters.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1043327#c11)  Vincent Danen    2013-12-18 19:45:23 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2013q4/000337.html> <http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1043327#c12)  Vincent Danen    2013-12-18 20:10:23 UTC  ``` This is fixed in upstream 1.4.16.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1043327#c14)  Huzaifa S.

## Summary

![eavesdrop on computer](img/nobody-listens3.jpg)

Many computers emit a high-pitched noise during operation, due to
vibration in some of their electronic components. These acoustic
emanations are more than a nuisance: they can convey information about the
software running on the computer and, in particular, leak sensitive
information about security-related computations. In a [preliminary
presentation](ec04rump/), we have shown that different RSA keys induce different
sound patterns, but it was not clear how to extract individual key bits.
The main problem was the very low bandwidth of the acoustic side channel
(under 20 kHz using common microphones, and a few hundred kHz using
ultrasound microphones), many orders of magnitude below the GHz-scale
clock rates of the attacked computers.

Here, we describe a new *acoustic cryptanalysis* key extraction
attack, applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack
can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of
various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer
during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally
demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain
mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone
placed 4 meters away.

Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack can
be performed by measuring the electric potential of a computer chassis. A
suitably-equipped attacker need merely touch the target computer with his
bare hand, or get the required leakage information from the ground wires
at the remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet cables.

## Q&A

### Q1: What information is leaked?

###

 This depends on the specific
computer hardware. We have tested numerous laptops, and several desktops.

* In almost all machines, it is possible to distinguish an idle
  CPU (x86 "HLT") from a busy CPU.
* On many machines, it is moreover possible to distinguish different
  patterns of CPU operations and different programs.
* Using [GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org/) as our study case,
  we can, on some machines:
  + distinguish between the acoustic signature of different RSA
    secret keys (signing or decryption), and
  + fully extract decryption keys, by measuring the sound the
    machine makes during decryption of chosen ciphertexts.

### Q2: What is making the noise?

The acoustic signal of interest is generated by vibration of electronic
components (capacitors and coils) in the computer's voltage regulation
circuit, as it struggles to supply constant voltage to the CPU.

When different secret keys are used for decryption, they cause different
patterns of CPU operations, which draw different amounts of power. The
voltage regulator changes its behavior to maintain a stable voltage to the
CPU despite the changes in power draw, and this alters the electric
currents and voltages inside the voltage regulator itself. Those electric
fluctuations cause mechanical vibrations in the electronic component, and
the vibrations are transmitted into the air as sound waves.

The relevant signal is *not* caused by mechanical components such
as the fan or hard disk, nor by the laptop's internal speaker.

### Q3: Does the attack require special equipment?

 It sure helps, and in the [paper](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/new.html#paper)
we describe an expensive hardware setup for getting the best sensitivity
and frequency response. But in some cases, a regular mobile phone is good
enough. We have used a mobile phone to acoustically extract keys from a
laptop at a distance of 30cm, as in the following picture.

![mobile phone attack](img/resized_mobile-attack.jpg)

### Q4: What is the acoustic attack range?

###

 That
depends on many factors. Using a sensitive parabolic microphone, we
surpassed 4 meters. In the following example, a parabolic microphone,
attached to a padded case of equipment (power supply, amplifier, filters,
and a laptop running the attack code) is extracting an RSA key from a
target laptop (on the far side of the room).

![parabolic mic attack in classroom](img/web_classroom.jpg)

Without the ungainly parabolic dish, we achieved a range of 1 meter. In
the following, the target (A) is on the right, and the attacker is on the
left. Only the capsule of the microphone, marked (B), is sensitive to
position and orientation; the rest of the attacker's equipment can be
hidden away.

![portable setup](img/web_portable-setup.jpg)

### Q5: What are some examples of attack scenarios?

###

[![TEMPEST-protected workstation](img/tempest-computer-api-dwt-crop.png)](http://www.advprograms.com/pdfs/105_Workstation_Specs.pdf)

We discuss some prospective attacks in our [paper](#paper).
In a nutshell:

* Install an attack app on your phone. Set up a meeting with the
  victim and place the phone on the desk next to his laptop (see [Q2](#Q-mobile)).
* Break into the victim's phone, install the attack app, and wait
  until the victim inadvertently places his phone next to the target
  laptop.
* Construct a web page use the microphone of the computer running the
  browser (using Flash or HTML Media Capture, under some excuse such as
  VoIP chat). When the user permits the microphone access, use it to
  steal the user's secret key.
* Put your stash of eavesdropping bugs and laser microphones to a new
  use.
* Send your server to a colocation facility, with a good microphone
  inside the box, and then acoustically extract keys from all nearby
  servers.
* Get near a TEMPEST/1-92 protected machine, such as the [one](http://www.advprograms.com/pdfs/105_Workstation_Specs.pdf)
  pictured to the right, place a microphone next to its ventilation
  holes, and extract its supposedly-protected secrets.

### Q6: What if I don't have any microphone, or the environment is too noisy?

###

Another low-bandwidth channel is the electric potential of the laptop's
chassis. We've shown that in many computers, this "ground" potential
fluctuates (even when connected to a grounded power supply) and leaks the
requisite signal. This can be measured in several ways, including *human
touch* and *far end of cable* attacks, which are detailed in
our follow-up paper titled "[Get Your Hands Off My
Laptop: Physical Side-Channel Key-Extraction Attacks On PCs](../handsoff)".

### Q7: Can an attacker use power analysis instead?

Yes, power analysis (by measuring the current drawn from the laptop's
DC power supply) is another way to perform our low-bandwidth attack.
This too is detailed in our follow-up paper, "[Get
Your Hands Off My Laptop: Physical Side-Channel Key-Extraction Attacks
On PCs](../handsoff)".

If the attacker can measure clockrate-scale (GHz) power leakage, then
traditional power analysis may also be very effective, and far faster.
However, this is foiled by the common practice of filtering out
high frequencies on the power supply.

### Q8: How can low-frequency (kHz) acoustic leakage provide useful information about a much faster (GHz)?

Individual CPU operations are too fast for a microphone to pick up, but
long operations (e.g., modular exponentiation in RSA) can create a
characteristic (and detectable) acoustic spectral signature over many
milliseconds. In the chosen-ciphertext key extraction attack, we carefully
craft the inputs to RSA decryption in order to maximize the dependence of
the spectral signature on the secret key bits. See also [Q18](#bit-extract).

For the acoustic channel, we can't just increase the measurement
bandwidth: the bandwidth of acoustic signals is very low: up to 20 kHz for
audible signals and commodity microphones, and up to a few hundred kHz
using ultrasound microphones. Above a few hundred kHz, sound propagation
in the air has a very short range: essentially, when you try to vibrate
air molecules so fast they just heat up, instead of moving in unison as a
sound wave.
### Q9: How vulnerable is GnuPG now?

We have disclosed our attack to GnuPG developers under [CVE-2013-4576](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4576),
suggested suitable countermeasures, and worked with the developers to test
them. New versions of GnuPG 1.x and of libgcrypt (which underlies GnuPG
2.x), containing these countermeasures and resistant to our current
key-extraction attack, were released concurrently with the first public
posting of these results. Some of the effects we found (including RSA key
distinguishability) remain present.
### Q10: How vulnerable are other algorithms and cryptographic implementations?

This is an open research question. Our attack requires careful
cryptographic analysis of the implementation, which so far has been
conducted only for the GnuPG 1.x implementation of RSA. Implementations
using ciphertext blinding (a common side channel countermeasure) appear
less vulnerable. We have, however, observed that GnuPG's implementation of
ElGamal encryption also allows acoustically distinguishing keys.
### Q11: Is there a realistic way to perform a chosen-ciphertext attack on GnuPG?

To apply the attack to GnuPG, we found a way to cause GnuPG to
automatically decrypt ciphertexts chosen by the attacker. The idea is to
use encrypted e-mail messages following the [OpenPGP](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880)
and [PGP/MIME](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3516)
protocols. For example, [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/)
(a popular plugin to the Thunderbird e-mail client) automatically
decrypts incoming e-mail (for notification purposes) using GnuPG. An
attacker can e-mail suitably-crafted messages to the victims, wait until
they reach the target computer, and observe the acoustic signature of
their decryption (as shown above), thereby closing the adaptive attack
loop.

### Q12: Won't the attack be foiled by loud fan noise, or by multitasking, or by several computers in the same room?

 Usually not. The interesting
acoustic signals are mostly above 10KHz, whereas typical computer fan
noise and normal room noise are concentrated at lower frequencies and can
thus be filtered out. In task-switching systems, different tasks can be
distinguished by their different acoustic spectral signatures. Using
multiple cores turns out to help the attack (by shifting down the signal
frequencies). When several computers are present, they can be told apart
by spatial localization, or by their different acoustic signatures (which
vary with the hardware, the component temperatures, and other
environmental conditions).
### Q13: What countermeasures are available?

###

 One
obvious countermeasure is to use sound dampening equipment, such as
"sound-proof" boxes, designed to sufficiently attenuate all relevant
frequencies. Conversely, a sufficiently strong wide-band noise source can
mask the informative signals, though ergonomic concerns may render this
unattractive. Careful circuit design and high-quality electronic
components can probably reduce the emanations.

Alternatively, the cryptographic software can be changed, and algorithmic
techniques employed to render the emanations less useful to the attacker.
These techniques ensure that the rough-scale behavior of the algorithm is
independent of the inputs it receives; they usually carry some performance
penalty, but are often used in any case to thwart other side-channel
attacks. This is what we helped implement in GnuPG (see [Q9](#Q-GnuPG)).
### Q14: Why software countermeasures? Isn't it the hardware's responsibility to avoid physical leakage?

It is tempting to enforce proper layering, and decree that preventing
physical leakage is the responsibility of the physical hardware.
Unfortunately, such low-level leakage prevention is often impractical
due to the very bad cost vs. security tradeoff: (1) any leakage remnants
can often be amplified by suitable manipulation at the higher levels, as
we indeed do in our chosen-ciphertext attack; (2) low-level mechanisms
try to protect all computation, even though most of it is insensitive or
does not induce easily-exploitable leakage; and (3) leakage is often an
inevitable side effect of essential performance-enhancing mechanisms
(e.g., consider [cache attacks](../papers/cache.pdf)).

Application-layer, algorithm-specific mitigation, in contrast, prevent
the (inevitably) leaked signal from bearing any useful information. It
is often cheap and effective, and most cryptographic software (including
GnuPG and libgcrypt) already includes various sorts of mitigation, both
through explicit code and through choice of algorithms. In fact, the
side-channel resistance of software implementations is nowadays a major
concern in the choice of cryptographic primitives, and was an explicit
evaluation criterion in NIST's AES and SHA-3 competitions.

### Q15: What about other acoustic attacks?

###

 See the discussion and
references in our [paper](#paper), and the Wikipedia page on
[Acoustic
Cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_cryptanalysis). In a nutshell:

Eavesdropping on keyboard keystrokes has been well discussed; keys can be
distinguished by timing, or by their different sounds. While this attack
is applicable to data that is entered manually (e.g., passwords), it is
not applicable to larger secret data such as RSA keys. Another acoustic
source is hard disk head seeks; this source does not appear very useful in
the presence of caching, delayed writes and multitasking. Preceding modern
computers is MI5's "ENGULF" technique (recounted in Peter Wright's book Spycatcher), whereby a phone tap was
used to eavesdrop on the operation of an Egyptian embassy's Hagelin cipher
machine, thereby recovering its secret key.
Declassified US government publications describe "TEMPEST" acoustic
leakage from mechanical and electromechanical devices, but do make no
mention of modern electronic computers.
### Q16: What's new since the [Eurocrypt 2004 presentation](ec04rump/)?

###

* Full key extraction attack, exploiting deep internal details of
  GnuP's implementation of RSA
* Dramatic improvement in range and applicability (increased from 20cm
  with open chassis to 4m in normal operation)
* Much better hardware (some self-built), allowing longer range and
  better signal characterization
* Signal processing and error correction, making it possible to
  perform the attack using a mobile phone despite the low-quality
  microphone
* Many more targets tested
* Non-acoustic low-bandwidth attacks, including chassis potential
  analysis
* Countermeasures implemented and tested in GnuPG (see [Q9](#Q-GnuPG))
* Detailed [writeup](#paper).

###

### Q17: What does this acoustic leakage sound like?

To human ears, the acoustic leakage typically sounds like a faint,
high-pitched whining or buzzing noise (if it is at all within audible
range).  However, if we could hear ultrasound, it might sound like
this [processed audio
recording of GnuPG decrypting several ciphertexts [mp3]](img/gnupg-manykeys-downshifted.mp3). (To make it
audible, we selected the interesting frequencies using a bandpass filter,
and then downshifted them to within human hearing range.) In this
recording, we can discern several pairs of tones. Each such pair is the
sound made by a single RSA decryption. There are two tones per decryption
because, internally, each GnuPG RSA decryption first exponentiates modulo
the secret prime *p* and then modulo the secret prime *q*
? and we can actually hear the difference between these stages.
Moreover, each of these pairs of tones sounds different ?
because each decryption uses a different key. So in this example, by
simply listening to the processed signal, we can distinguish between
different secret keys,

A better way to understand the signal is to visualize it as a spectrogram,
which plots the acoustic power as a function of time and frequency. For
example, here is another recording of GnuPG decrypting several RSA
ciphertexts:

![spectrogram of multiple GnuPG RSA decryptions](img/web_manykeys-acoustic.jpg "spectrogram of multiple GnuPG RSA decryptions")

In this spectrogram, the horizontal axis (frequency) spans 40 kHz, and the
vertical axis (time) spans 1.4 seconds. Each yellow arrow points to the
middle of a GnuPG RSA decryption. It is easy to see where each decryption
starts and ends. We also observe that the sound changes halfway through
each decryption: this is the aforementioned switch from the secret prime *p*
to the secret prime *q.* Most interestingly, we can see the subtle
differences between these decryptions (especially near the yellow arrows)
? and thus distinguish between different secret keys.
### Q18: How do you extract the secret key bits?

The key extraction attacks finds the secret key bits one by one,
sequentially. For each bit, the attacker crafts a ciphertext of a special
form, that makes the acoustic leakage depend specifically on the value of
that bit. The attacker then triggers decryption of that chosen
ciphertext, records the resulting sound, and analyzes it. The following
demonstrates a typical stage of this attack, focusing on a single secret
key bit. If this bit is 0, then decryption of the chosen ciphertext will
sound like the left-side spectrogram (with a strong component at 35.2
kHz). If the secret bit is 1, the decryption will sound like the
right-side spectrogram (where the strong component is at 38.1 kHz).

![spectrograms depending on value of a key bit](img/web_bit-extraction.jpg "spectrograms depending on value of a key bit")

Using automated signal classification, the attack tells apart these cases,
and deduces the secret key bit.

### Q19: Aren't sensitive devices protected by shielding?

Interestingly, many of the physical side-channel countermeasures used
in highly sensitive applications, such as air gaps, Faraday cages, and
power supply filters, provide no protection against acoustic leakage. In
particular, Faraday cages containing computers require ventilation,
which is typically provided by means of vents covered with perforated
sheet metal or metal honeycomb (see [Q1 above](#scenarios)).
These are very effective at attenuating compromising electromagnetic
radiation (``TEMPEST''), but are nearly transparent to sound.

For example, the following depicts recording the acoustic emanations
through a double-honeycomb metal ventilation mesh designed for blocking
electromagnetic radiation. (Covering this mesh with cardboard eliminates
the signal.)

![microphone measuring a laptop through a mesh ventilation panel](img/web_mesh-setup.jpg)

### Q20: What is the purpose of your research?

People entrust their most private information to computers, under the
assumption that their computers will keep their secrets. Our goal is to
discover when this assumption is dangerously false: to understand how
information may be leaking in unexpected ways that can be used
nefariously. We then seek ways to build software and hardware that will
better protect the users. In this case, for example, we worked with the
developers of the vulnerable software to change the mathematical
operations so that the emitted sound will not reveal the secret key.

Moreover, at a philosophical level, we are intrigued by the tension
between *computation* and *computers*. Most of computer
science  deals with *computation*, the abstract
mathematical manipulation of numbers, with formally-designated inputs
and outputs. But this computation is eventually embodied in
physical  *computers,* with myriad unexpected outputs
(physical leakage) and inputs (via sensors and faults). The abstractions
underlying computer science and programming, productive as they are,
blind us to those phenomena. By challenging and excavating through the
convenient abstractions, we gain a deeper understanding of those
evanescent ensembles of energy and electrons to which we entrust our
daily lives.

As the primary fix for CVE-2013-4576, GnuPG 1.x now uses blinding to
mitigate RSA key extraction attacks. This doesn't affect GnuPG 2.x as
libgcrypt does blinding by default.

The acoustic attack leveraged some particulars of GnuPG by zero-padding
input to force modular reductions in GnuPG's RSA implementation. GnuPG
now cripples this lever by normalizing MPIs used as inputs to secret
key functions.

This secondary mitigation measure was introduced in GnuPG 1.4.16 and
libgcrypt 1.6.0 (relevant for vendors shipping GnuPG 2.x).

# RHSA-2014:0016 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: gnupg security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0016)

## Topic

An updated gnupg package that fixes one security issue is now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) is a tool for encrypting data and
creating digital signatures, compliant with the proposed OpenPGP Internet
standard and the S/MIME standard.

It was found that GnuPG was vulnerable to side-channel attacks via acoustic
cryptanalysis. An attacker in close range to a target system that is
decrypting ciphertexts could possibly use this flaw to recover the RSA
secret key from that system. (CVE-2013-4576)

Red Hat would like to thank Werner Koch of GnuPG upstream for reporting
this issue. Upstream acknowledges Genkin, Shamir, and Tromer as the
original reporters.

All gnupg users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

Hello!

Along with the publication of an interesting new side channel attack by
Daniel Genkin, Adi Shamir, and Eran Tromer we announce the availability
of a new stable GnuPG release to relieve this bug: Version 1.4.16.

This is a *security fix* release and all users of GnuPG versions 1.x are
advised to updated to this version.  GnuPG versions 2.x are not
affected.  See below for the impact of the problem.

The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is GNU's tool for secure communication
and data storage.  It is a complete and free replacement of PGP and
can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.  It
includes an advanced key management facility, smartcard support and is
compliant with the OpenPGP Internet standard as described by RFC-4880.

Note that this version is from the GnuPG-1 series and thus smaller than
those from the GnuPG-2 series, easier to build, and also better portable
to ancient platforms.  In contrast to GnuPG-2 (e.g version 2.0.22) it
comes with no support for S/MIME, Secure Shell, or other tools useful
for desktop environments.  Fortunately you may install both versions
alongside on the same system without any conflict.

What's New
===========

 * Fixed the RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic
   Cryptanalysis attack as described by Genkin, Shamir, and Tromer.
   See <<http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/>>.  [CVE-2013-4576]

 * Put only the major version number by default into armored output.

 * Do not create a trustdb file if --trust-model=always is used.

 * Print the keyid for key packets with --list-packets.

 * Changed modular exponentiation algorithm to recover from a small
   performance loss due to a change in 1.4.14.

Impact of the security problem
==============================

CVE-2013-4576 has been assigned to this security bug.

The paper describes two attacks.  The first attack allows to distinguish
keys: An attacker is able to notice which key is currently used for
decryption.  This is in general not a problem but may be used to reveal
the information that a message, encrypted to a commonly not used key,
has been received by the targeted machine.  We do not have a software
solution to mitigate this attack.

The second attack is more serious.  It is an adaptive chosen ciphertext
attack to reveal the private key.  A possible scenario is that the
attacker places a sensor (for example a standard smartphone) in the
vicinity of the targeted machine.  That machine is assumed to do
unattended RSA decryption of received mails, for example by using a mail
client which speeds up browsing by opportunistically decrypting mails
expected to be read soon.  While listening to the acoustic emanations of
the targeted machine, the smartphone will send new encrypted messages to
that machine and re-construct the private key bit by bit.  A 4096 bit
RSA key used on a laptop can be revealed within an hour.

GnuPG 1.4.16 avoids this attack by employing RSA blinding during
decryption.  GnuPG 2.x and current Gpg4win versions make use of
Libgcrypt which employs RSA blinding anyway and are thus not vulnerable.

For the highly interesting research on acoustic cryptanalysis and the
details of the attack see <http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/> .

Getting the Software
====================

First of all, decide whether you really need GnuPG version 1.4.x - most
users are better off with the modern GnuPG 2.0.x version.  Then follow
the instructions found at <http://www.gnupg.org/download/> or read on:

GnuPG 1.4.16 may be downloaded from one of the GnuPG mirror sites or
direct from ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/ .  The list of mirrors can be
found at <http://www.gnupg.org/mirrors.html> .  Note, that GnuPG is not
available at ftp.gnu.org.

On the mirrors you should find the following files in the *gnupg*
directory:

  gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2 (3571k)
  gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2.sig

      GnuPG source compressed using BZIP2 and OpenPGP signature.

  gnupg-1.4.16.tar.gz (4955k)
  gnupg-1.4.16.tar.gz.sig

      GnuPG source compressed using GZIP and OpenPGP signature.

  gnupg-1.4.15-1.4.15.diff.bz2 (26k)

      A patch file to upgrade a 1.4.15 GnuPG source tree.  This patch
      does not include updates of the language files.

Select one of them. To shorten the download time, you probably want to
get the BZIP2 compressed file.  Please try another mirror if exceptional
your mirror is not yet up to date.

In the *binary* directory, you should find these files:

  gnupg-w32cli-1.4.16.exe (1573k)
  gnupg-w32cli-1.4.16.exe.sig

      GnuPG compiled for Microsoft Windows and its OpenPGP signature.
      This is a command line only version; the source files are the same
      as given above.  Note, that this is a minimal installer and unless
      you are just in need for the gpg binary, you are better off using
      the full featured installer at <http://www.gpg4win.org> .  Gpg4win
      uses GnuPG 2.x and is thus not affected by the security bug.

Checking the Integrity
======================

In order to check that the version of GnuPG which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of
the following ways:

 * If you already have a trusted version of GnuPG installed, you
   can simply check the supplied signature.  For example to check the
   signature of the file gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2 you would use this command:

     gpg --verify gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2.sig

   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.
   You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and
   made by that signing key.  Make sure that you have the right key,
   either by checking the fingerprint of that key with other sources
   or by checking that the key has been signed by a trustworthy other
   key.  Note, that you can retrieve the signing key using the command

     finger wk ,at' g10code.com | gpg --import

   or using a keyserver like

     gpg --recv-key 4F25E3B6

   The distribution key 4F25E3B6 is signed by the well known key
   1E42B367.  If you get an key expired message, you should retrieve a
   fresh copy as the expiration date might have been prolonged.

   NEVER USE A GNUPG VERSION YOU JUST DOWNLOADED TO CHECK THE
   INTEGRITY OF THE SOURCE - USE AN EXISTING GNUPG INSTALLATION!

 * If you are not able to use an old version of GnuPG, you have to verify
   the SHA-1 checksum.  Assuming you downloaded the file
   gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2, you would run the sha1sum command like this:

     sha1sum gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2

   and check that the output matches the first line from the
   following list:

0bf5e475f3eb6f33d5474d017fe5bf66070e43f4  gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2
ea40324a5b2e3a16ffb63ea0ccc950a3faf5b11c  gnupg-1.4.16.tar.gz
ead70b47218ba76da51c16b652bee2a712faf2f6  gnupg-1.4.15-1.4.16.diff.bz2
82079c7c183467b4dd3795ca197983cd2494cec4  gnupg-w32cli-1.4.16.exe

Internationalization
====================

GnuPG comes with support for 29 languages.  The Chinese (Simple and
Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Polish,
Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Turkish translations
are close to be complete.

Support
=======

A listing with commercial support offers for GnuPG is available at:

  <http://www.gnupg.org/service.html>

The driving force behind the development of GnuPG is the company of its
principal author, Werner Koch.  Maintenance and improvement of GnuPG and
related software take up a most of their resources.  To allow them
continue their work they ask to either purchase a support contract,
engage them for custom enhancements, or to donate money:

  <http://g10code.com/gnupg-donation.html>

Thanks
======

We have to thank all the people who helped with this release, be it
testing, coding, translating, suggesting, auditing, donating money,
spreading the word, or answering questions on the mailing lists.  Many
thanks to Eran Tromer for providing early drafts of the paper and
testing the fixes.

Happy Hacking,

  The GnuPG Team
