Release 0.3:• Enhancement: Make pyxtrlock conform to the XDG specification. Patch by Cristian Ciupitu.• Enhancement: Ship script to create an empty lock symbol. Patch by Alexander Klink.• Enhancement: Retry grabbing the keyboard as well as the mouse to prevent issues when starting pyxtrlock from a keyboard shortcut. Patch by Nils Ballmann.• Enhancement: Support the XSS\_SLEEP\_LOCK\_FD protocol implemented by xss-lock with the option -l to inhibit standby/hibernate/... until the the screen is locked.
Release 0.2 :• Security: Check correctly for the result of the xcb\_grab\_{pointer,keyboard} commands (CVE-2013-4427).• Security: Limit length of buffered password to prevent memory exhaustion (this is a real concern when attacked with custom hardware which simulates most rapid keystrokes)• Security: Fix several memory leaks• Enhancement: Report missing libraries when loading via ctypes.• Enhancement: Provide ability and tools to use custom lock images as cursor
Release 0.1:• [#8] Security: Fixed a typo that could in some circumstances lead to a crash after multiple failed authentication attempts. Thanks, Paul Lhussiez (CVE-2013-4426).

Heh. I'll have to rmemeber that =)

So for pyxtrlock please use:

Subject: CVE request: pyxtrlock

Hi,

two security issues were found and fixed in pyxtrlock[1], a lightweight X
screen locker.

• A mis-spelled variable name could cause the program to crash and thus
  unlock the screen without requiring a password if the erroneous code
  line was reached, which could be achieved by correctly timing multiple
  authentication failures.

  This was found by Paul Lhussiez and reported to us at

      <<https://github.com/leonnnn/pyxtrlock/issues/8>>

  Commit containing the fix, and security release announcement:

      <<https://github.com/leonnnn/pyxtrlock/commit/297a697ce1543451166a9c85ba1e0dd76fa4ae10>>
      <<https://zombofant.net/blog/2013/8/pyxtrlock-release-0.1-130825>>

  All versions before release 0.1 or git commit 297a697 are vulnerable.

• Incorrect return value checking after calling XCB library functions
  led to the program seemingly starting up normally, but leaving the
  keyboard or mouse not actually locked in case the xcb_grab_*()
  functions returned an error. There would be no indication for the user
  that one of the input devices is not locked.

  Commit containing the fix, and security release announcement:

      <<https://github.com/leonnnn/pyxtrlock/commit/50a8522392809a5688638d074fb9f84264c8b58d>>
      <<https://zombofant.net/blog/2013/9/pyxtrlock-release-0.2-130909>>

  All versions before release 0.2 or git commit 50a8522 are vulnerable.

Could CVE-IDs be assigned for these, please?

    -- Leon.        (pyxtrlock maintainer)
