```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - The application is vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient input sanitization when updating user information and security questions.
    - The application is vulnerable to CSRF due to missing CSRF protection when updating user information and security questions.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Impact of exploitation:
    - XSS: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.
    - CSRF: An attacker can trick a user into making unwanted changes to their account, such as modifying personal information or security settings.
- Attack vectors:
    - XSS: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the first name, last name or security question fields.
    - CSRF: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that submits data to the vulnerable application.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - XSS: Attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable input fields.
    - CSRF: The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to visit a malicious website or execute malicious code in their browser.
