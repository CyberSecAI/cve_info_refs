Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Tryton client does not properly sanitize the file extension provided by the server when processing reports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal/Arbitrary File Write:** The client uses the file extension from the server to save reports. A malicious server can inject path separators (e.g., "/", "\", "..") in the file extension. This allows an attacker to control the file path where the report is saved, leading to arbitrary file writes on the client's system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite existing files on the client's system, potentially causing data loss or system compromise.
*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** An attacker could create new files in arbitrary locations, potentially planting malicious payloads or interfering with system operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Server:** The attack requires the client to connect to a compromised or malicious Tryton server.
*   **Server-Supplied Filename:** The server sends a report to the client with a manipulated file extension, which includes path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to control or compromise a Tryton server that the victim's client connects to.
*   The attacker does not require access to the client machine directly.
*  The attacker needs to craft a malicious report with a manipulated file extension to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is located in how the client handles the server-provided file extensions for reports.
*   The provided content suggests that the issue could lead to the client writing to arbitrary files with the permissions of the user running the Tryton client.
*   The issue was addressed in specific versions of the Tryton client, namely version 1.6.1-1+deb6u1 for oldstable (squeeze) and 2.2.3-1+deb7u1 for stable (wheezy).
