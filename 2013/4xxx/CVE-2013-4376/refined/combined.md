| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:45:54 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached an updated graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a configure in the tarball, so the ebuild might look a little funny because it uses autogen.sh instead of configure.  Besides the version update, the following was added:  1. Dependencies 2. conditional tcltk dependency (Not sure if this works for portage tcl-tk-8.3.3, as the portage version is broken.  It doesn't install private headers.  I submitted fixed tcl and tk ebuilds to this list previously, and it works with those)  3. Documentation  I have also attached a diff between the original and the new ebuild.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:46:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2](attachment.cgi?id=2 "graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=2&action=edit "graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild")] graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:47:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3](attachment.cgi?id=3 "graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=3&action=edit "graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=3&action=diff "graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff")] graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 22:13:33 UTC  ``` commited, added depends on 25 too, so that I get notified when 25 is fixed. ``` |  |

# X2Go Server: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **201310-19**

A path vulnerability in X2Go Server may allow remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/x2goserver** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.0.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.0.2** |

### Background

X2Go is an open source terminal server project.

### Description

A vulnerability in the setgid wrapper x2gosqlitewrapper.c does not
hardcode an internal path to x2gosqlitewrapper.pl, allowing a remote
attacker to change that path.

### Impact

A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the server process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All X2Go Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/x2goserver-4.0.0.2"

```
### References

* [CVE-2013-4376](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-4376)

**Release date**
