Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4376:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a path handling issue in the `x2gosqlitewrapper.c` setgid wrapper within X2Go Server. Specifically, the wrapper does not use a hardcoded, absolute path to the `x2gosqlitewrapper.pl` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Path Handling:** The `x2gosqlitewrapper.c` wrapper, intended to be run with setgid privileges, does not enforce a fixed path for the perl script it executes. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path used to execute the script.
- **Setgid Misuse:** The setgid mechanism, designed to grant elevated privileges for specific tasks, is exploited due to the path vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the x2go user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can leverage the path vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the privileges of the user running the X2Go server process, usually the x2go user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely, making it a significant security risk.
- **Path Manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate the path used by the `x2gosqlitewrapper.c` to point to a malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable X2Go server over the network.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the path vulnerability in the `x2gosqlitewrapper.c` wrapper and understand how to exploit it by manipulating the path.
- **Ability to control the path of the perl script** The attacker needs to have a way to change the path used by the wrapper in order to point to their own malicious script.

**Summary of the Security Advisory (GLSA 201310-19):**

The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201310-19) clearly describes the vulnerability, affected versions, and provides a resolution for Gentoo users, which aligns with the CVE description and the information found in the mailing list discussion.
