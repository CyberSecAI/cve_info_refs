Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-4884

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of server responses when generating a port scan report in McAfee SuperScan 4.0. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks via a specially crafted server response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-controlled data (in this case, data from server responses) before including it in the generated port scan report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the port scan report. When a user views the report, the injected scripts will execute within their browser, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Malicious redirects
  - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to control the response from a server that is being scanned by McAfee SuperScan. By crafting a malicious response, they can inject a UTF-7 encoded XSS payload into the scan report generated by the tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control or have access to a server that will be scanned by McAfee SuperScan.
- They need to be able to send a specially crafted response containing a UTF-7 encoded XSS payload to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The advisory provides the following example of an injectable payload (partially UTF-7 encoded):
  ```
  +ADw-img src=x onerror='a setter=alert,a="UTF-7-XSS";'+AD4-
  ```
- The vulnerability can be automated using the Portspoof software, suggesting that the exploitation is straightforward if the attacker can control the server response.
