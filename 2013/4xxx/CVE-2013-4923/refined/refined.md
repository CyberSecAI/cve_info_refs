Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4923:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a vulnerability in the DCOM ISystemActivator dissector within Wireshark. Specifically, the dissector can crash when processing certain malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a crash due to a malformed DCOM ISystemActivator packet. The dissector doesn't handle these packets correctly, causing a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition, as Wireshark will crash. This could disrupt network analysis and troubleshooting activities that depend on Wireshark.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the injection of a malformed DCOM ISystemActivator packet onto the network. Additionally, an attacker could also cause the crash by convincing a user to open a malformed packet capture file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the capability to inject a malformed DCOM ISystemActivator packet into the network or create a malformed packet capture file. This suggests the attacker needs to have a position where they can inject network traffic or social engineer someone into opening a malicious file. No additional privileges are needed for the attack.

**Additional details:**
The vulnerability was discovered by Laurent Butti.
The vulnerability is addressed in Wireshark version 1.10.1.
It is related to multiple other CVEs all fixed in 1.10.1 and all discovered by Laurent Butti. These related CVEs involve other dissectors and similar crashes (e.g., CVE-2013-4922, CVE-2013-4924, CVE-2013-4925, CVE-2013-4926)

The provided content from gentoo also indicates a large number of vulnerabilities resolved in the same Wireshark update which may have the same impact and attack vector.
