| [Description](#c0)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2014-07-27 02:57:30 UTC  ``` Vulnerabilities from 1.7.7-r1 to 1.7.15  Review Board - 1.7.10 Fixed an XSS vulnerability where users could trigger script errors under certain conditions in auto-complete widgets.  ---  Review Board - 1.7.12 Function names in diff headers are no longer rendered as HTML. Patch by Damian Johnson. ([Bug #2612](show_bug.cgi?id=2612 "RESOLVED FIXED - net-mail/teapop xinetd conf file points to wrong path"))  If a user’s full name contained HTML, the Submitters list would render it as HTML, without escaping it. This was an XSS vulnerability. (CVE-2013-4795)  The default Apache configuration is now more strict with how it serves up file attachments. This does not apply to older installations. To update your configuration, and to read best practices, read our guide on securing file attachments.  Uploaded files are now renamed to include a hash, preventing users from uploading malicious filenames, and making filenames unguessable.  Recaptcha support has been updated to use the new URLs provided by Google. This re-enables Recaptcha support when serving over HTTPS.  ---  Review Board - 1.7.13 We now require Django 1.4.6, which is their latest security release. It fixes a couple of issues that we are not impacted by, but are worth having for any third-party modules, applications or extensions.  We have updated the recommended Apache configuration for file attachment protection. We will be unveiling a better security method in coming releases, but for now, if you’re serving file attachments from Apache, be sure to update your configuration based on our recommendations.  ---  Review Board - 1.7.14 We now require Django 1.4.8, which is their latest security release. It fixes a major denial-of-service attack vector against the authentication support. We strongly encourage everybody running Review Board 1.7.x to update to this release, particularly if you’re running a site exposed to the Internet.  Some API resources were accessible even if their parent resources were not, due to a missing check. In most cases, this was harmless, but it can affect those using access control on groups or review requests.  ---  Review Board - 1.7.15 Vulnerabilities: Some API resources returned information on private review requests the caller did not have access to (by way of an invite-only group, private repository, or Local Site), if the appropriate database IDs were known or discovered. (CVE-2013-4410)  Summaries for private review requests were displayed on the All Review Requests page, on the review request list on a user’s page, and through a specially crafted dashboard URL. (CVE-2013-4411)  Extensions making use of JSONField are now more protected from possible remote code exploits, if they’re not already being careful of input. This was reported and fixed by Frederik Braun from Mozilla. (CVE-2013-4409) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2014-08-19 23:21:21 UTC  ``` CVE-2013-4795 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-4795>):   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Submitters list in Review   Board 1.6.x before 1.6.18 and 1.7.x before 1.7.12 allows remote attackers to   inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a user full name. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2014-09-10 03:24:32 UTC  ``` Please upgrade in [bug 522472](show_bug.cgi?id=522472 "RESOLVED FIXED - <dev-util/reviewboard-1.7.28: Two Vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-{5027, 5028})") to Version 1.7.27 or above, setting dependency. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2014-10-05 18:44:44 UTC  ``` Maintainer(s), Thank you for your work.   No GLSA needed as there are no stable versions. ``` |  |

Understood. What are the particular dependencies? I can file RFP bug
reports to coordinate the discussion, if you like.

Firstly it's djblets. It was present in debian some times ago (together
with old version of reviewboard). I've created new ITP for it: #656275

Also reviewboard optionally depends on pylucene which is in very bad state
(removed for testing, unstable version still depends on python 2.5).

Hi,

I'm sorry, but unfortunately I was busy with other things. I've some
initial stuff. And since there is some demand on reviewboard in debian,
I'll try to make something to show this weekend.

It's will be cool if you'll review/sponsor it.

Thanks a lot!

I'm still working on it. Followed dependencies are packaged and are
waiting for sponsor:

- python-django-djblets

Just a reminder. I'm still looking for sponsor for these reviewboard
related packages. There is just one issue left (with conflicting
python-django-pipeline vs python-pipeline).

I'm not sure how to solve it. Author of python-pipeline (that is already
in debian) stated that he is going to rename his module to something else.

Holger, thank you for offering to sponsor these packages. Have you made

it's stalled at the "python-django-pipeline vs python-pipeline" issue,
installing the former breaks the later, there is a serious bug (#674042) filed
about this.

Hi,

Sorry for very slow response. Currently I'm mostly busy with some other
things.. I'll return to this in a few weeks.

As about original question, we've a few important issues here:

1. django-pipeline vs pipeline issue.

2. We can't ship latest release of ReviewBoard because it uses outdated
   version of django library (1.3.x) while debian already ships 1.4.
   Currently only git snapshots have support of 1.4:
	[http://www.mail-archive.com/reviewboard@googlegroups.com/msg08761.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/reviewboard%40googlegroups.com/msg08761.html)

3. ReviewBoard requires outdated versions of jQuery libraries. It's almost
   the same thing as with django. Upstream will not switch to recent
   versions soon, since it requires too much work. I was able to fix some
   of issues when using together with jQuery from Debian. But some of them
   are still present. Patches are not large but for now they can't be
   contributed upstream.

4. Upstream asked to not package git snapshot of reviewboard at all due to some
   known issues. There are some issues with db upgrades (it's impossible
   to 'upgrade' current 1.6 installation to 1.7-git and it'll be probably
   impossible to upgrade from 1.7-git to 1.7-release when it'll be ready).
	<http://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/issues/detail?id=1835>

That's why my current plan is to package ReviewBoard to experimental only
with some notes about these issues

Thank you for the update. I look forward to more news about this package's
progress, and remember you can ask for help on the ‘debian-python’ or
‘debian-mentors’ forums.

Hello,

I haven't seen an update on this ITP since 30 Aug 2012, and the mentors
bug was closed after no response (#669720).

It would be really great if this work wasn't lost, it seemed very close
to being finished. Maybe now things are in a better state?

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1016596#c0)  Stephen Gallagher    2013-10-08 11:38:37 UTC  ``` === Summary === Certain functions within Review Board's REST API were not properly validating authorization decisions against access-control lists.  === Affected Deployments === This CVE affects Review Board deployments using the "local sites" feature or those using "private review requests".  === Scope === If the attacker was aware of specific database table IDs, it was possible to gain access to restricted data. This vulnerability does not lead directly to a compromise of a machine or denial of service, but may expose sensitive information such as details about other embargoed security issues or confidential intellectual property.  This attack would be possible through the remote public API.  === Resolution === Code was added to ensure that such objects are now filtered out of requests made by accounts that do not have access to this information.  === Acknowledgements === Christian Hammond, lead upstream developer of Review Board is credited with discovering and correcting this vulnerability.  === Embargo Information === Upstream has coordinated with packagers of various distributions and cloud application vendors to lift the embargo on Thursday, October 8, 2013. This BZ should become public at that time.   Upstream has requested that Red Hat please coordinate the issuance of a CVE for this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1016596#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-10-08 14:40:23 UTC  ``` The embargo lifts Thursday October 10th.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1016596#c2)  Murray McAllister    2013-10-10 23:51:52 UTC  ```  Created ReviewBoard tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1017999](show_bug.cgi?id=1017999 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4410 CVE-2013-4411 ReviewBoard: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1018000](show_bug.cgi?id=1018000 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4410 CVE-2013-4411 ReviewBoard: various flaws [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1016596#c3)  Murray McAllister    2013-10-10 23:59:21 UTC  ``` Public now:  <http://www.reviewboard.org/news/2013/10/10/new-security-releases-review-board-1-6-19-and-1-7-15/>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1016596#c4)  Fedora Update System    2013-10-29 03:39:41 UTC  ``` ReviewBoard-1.7.16-2.fc19, python-djblets-0.7.21-1.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.
