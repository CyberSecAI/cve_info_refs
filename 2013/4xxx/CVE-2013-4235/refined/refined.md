      "content": "The provided content discusses CVE-2013-4235, a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability in shadow-utils related to copying and removing directory trees.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\nThe vulnerability is caused by a TOCTOU race condition in how shadow-utils (specifically usermod/userdel) handles copying and removal of directory trees. This means there is a window between the time the program checks the state of a file or directory and the time it actually uses it, during which an attacker can modify the directory or file structure.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- TOCTOU race condition in file/directory handling within shadow-utils, specifically in usermod and userdel.\n- Improper handling of symbolic links during directory operations.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Unauthorized modification or removal of files/directories outside of the intended user directory.\n- A local attacker with write privileges in a target directory can potentially escalate their privileges or impact the system's integrity by manipulating the file system.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Local attacker with write privileges to a directory that will be removed or copied by usermod/userdel.\n- Attacker exploits the timing window to replace or modify the target directory before the shadow-utils tool finishes its operations.\n- Symbolic links may be used to manipulate actions outside of the target directory.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- Local access to the system.\n- Write privileges in a directory that will be operated on by usermod/userdel.\n- Ability to manipulate the file system (e.g. by creating symbolic links).",
      "additional_details": "The content from multiple sources including Red Hat, Gentoo, Debian, SUSE, and Ubuntu confirms that this vulnerability exists in shadow-utils and its different versions. Also, the discussions and fixes in the upstream project are well documented, for example on github: <https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/issues/317>,  <https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/545>, <https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/dcca8653a54b5a03b0234238dbc6388f6b59adc3>, and <https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/483/commits/b4472167c2f5057d56686d3349a9b55fc508efe6>. SUSE also documents a very detailed set of affected products and their respective fixes at https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4235.html. Some sources also note that this vulnerability is not easily exploitable, and might need non-default configurations to be impactful. The fix includes ensuring that operations are not performed on symbolic links. Additionally it is mentioned the fixes for the vulnerability lead to regression issues in older systems, in particular relating to the use of the AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flag."
