  "cve": "CVE-2013-4412",
  "affected_component": "slim",
  "vulnerability": "NULL pointer dereference",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a potential NULL pointer dereference when using the crypt() function from glibc 2.17+. When processing malformed or unsupported salts, the login daemon could crash due to the NULL pointer dereference.",
  "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the login daemon, which can lead to denial of service. An attacker can cause the login daemon to crash by providing malformed or unsupported salts.",
  "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through the login process where the system attempts to authenticate users. By providing malformed or unsupported salts during the login attempt, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted salt during the login process. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.",
  "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects systems using glibc 2.17 or later and older versions of the slim login manager. The fix involves addressing the NULL pointer dereference when handling invalid salts, and this was resolved in slim version 1.3.6 and backported to 1.3.5-r4 on Gentoo."
