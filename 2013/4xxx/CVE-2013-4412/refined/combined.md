| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-10-11 19:23:36 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  Slim 1.3.6 fixes a security flaw related to a potential NULL ptr. dereference when using crypt() from glibc 2.17+ (eglibc 2.17+). Without the fix, malformed or unsupported salts crash the login daemon.  Upstream fix: <http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/slim/commit/?id=fbdfae3b406b1bb6f4e5e440e79b9b8bb8f071fb>    @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please say explicitly if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-10-12 13:28:44 UTC  ``` I dropped HPPA keywords on the older versions. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-10-12 13:29:00 UTC  ``` Oops, wrong bug. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2013-10-12 14:51:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeroen Roovers from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=487688#c2)) > Oops, wrong bug.

Given the amount of patchwork I had to do in the build system, I don't have as much confidence in this version as I've had in the past; if stabilization can wait 30 days that would be preferable, just to give it more testing time in the field. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Alex Legler (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2013-10-17 15:48:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ian Stakenvicius from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=487688#c4)) > New ebuild is in the tree.   >  > Given the amount of patchwork I had to do in the build system, I don't have > as much confidence in this version as I've had in the past; if stabilization > can wait 30 days that would be preferable, just to give it more testing time > in the field.  To comply with our preferred 20 days of delay for an issue of this severity, I'd go for 15 days here max.  For the future, to give users a clean upgrade path, security bumps should be as straight-forward as possible, so fixing other (build system?) issues that require more extensive testing should be done in a another revision of the package. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Ian Stakenvicius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-10-17 15:52:10 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alex Legler from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=487688#c5)) > (In reply to Ian Stakenvicius from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=487688#c4)) > > New ebuild is in the tree.   > >  > > Given the amount of patchwork I had to do in the build system, I don't have > > as much confidence in this version as I've had in the past; if stabilization > > can wait 30 days that would be preferable, just to give it more testing time > > in the field. >  > To comply with our preferred 20 days of delay for an issue of this severity, > I'd go for 15 days here max. >  > For the future, to give users a clean upgrade path, security bumps should be > as straight-forward as possible, so fixing other (build system?) issues that > require more extensive testing should be done in a another revision of the > package.  I agree.  The issue here is that upstream changed around a fair bit of stuff between this new version and the previous one, and to be honest I have no idea how they could have released it in the state they did because as far as I could tell it just plain wouldn't build.  From inspecting the code and testing locally, it seems like everything will still work fine, but this general lack of care by upstream this time around reduces my confidence that there aren't other hidden issues.  15 days should be fine, though.  Thanks! ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Ian Stakenvicius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-10-22 14:57:27 UTC  ``` Given the other issues with slim-1.3.6, and chithead pointing out that the fix is actually a very simple backport, I decided to backport it and revbump slim-1.3.5.  CC'ing arches to stabilize immediately:  =x11-misc/slim-1.3.5-r4 : KEYWORDS="amd64 arm ppc ppc64 sparc x86" ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-10-25 10:51:13 UTC  ``` amd64/ppc/ppc64/x86 stable ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-12-17 15:02:51 UTC  ``` sparc stable.  Maintainer(s), please cleanup.

Hi,

the following vulnerability was published for slim.

[CVE-2013-4412](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4412)[0]:
NULL ptr dereference

Upstream fix is at [1] and as eglibc (>= 2.17) is only in jessie and
unstable it does not affect oldstable and stable.

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.

For further information see:

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1017430#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-10-09 21:00:12 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that slim 1.3.6 corrected [2] a potential security related to a potential NULL pointer dereference when using crypt() from glibc 2.17+.  If using this version of glibc with older versions of slim, the login daemon could crash when processing malformed or unsupported salts.  Although Fedora 18 ships this version of slim, it does not use a version of glibc that exposes this issue (Fedora 18 ships with glibc 2.16).  [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/10/09/4> [2] <http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/slim/commit/?id=fbdfae3b406b1bb6f4e5e440e79b9b8bb8f071fb>   ``` |  |
