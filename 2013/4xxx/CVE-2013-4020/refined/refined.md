Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-4020

**Analysis:**

The IBM security bulletin (from www-01.ibm.com) directly addresses multiple vulnerabilities, including those mentioned in the CVE description, in various IBM products related to asset and service management.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Enables an attacker to gain higher levels of access or permissions than they should have.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete data in the database.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive information that should be protected.

**Affected Products:**

The following IBM products are affected by one or more of the identified vulnerabilities:

*   IBM Maximo Asset Management (Versions 6.2 through 7.5)
*   Maximo Asset Management Essentials
*   Maximo for Government
*   Maximo for Nuclear Power
*   Maximo for Transportation
*   Maximo for Life Sciences
*   Maximo for Oil and Gas
*   Maximo for Utilities
*  Tivoli Service Request Manager
*   Maximo Asset Management for IT
*   Tivoli Change and Configuration Management Database
*   IBM Control Desk

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to theft or manipulation.
*   **System Compromise:** Attackers can potentially gain control of systems or applications due to privilege escalation.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Through SQL injection, attackers can modify or destroy sensitive data.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to significant damage to an organization's reputation and loss of trust.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Applications:** The XSS vulnerability likely stems from flaws in input handling or output encoding within the web interfaces of the affected products.
*   **Database Interaction:** SQL Injection attacks are typically made via malicious input to the application that interacts with the underlying database.
*   **Application Logic:** Privilege escalation could be due to flaws in the application's permission or authentication management.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker would need network access to the affected system or application.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities requires technical knowledge of web applications, SQL, and privilege escalation techniques.
*   **User interaction:** For XSS, the attacker may need to trick a user to interact with a malicious link or content.

**Additional Notes:**
