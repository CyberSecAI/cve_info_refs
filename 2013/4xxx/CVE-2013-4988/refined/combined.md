How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

IcoFX Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: IcoFX Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-1107
Advisory URL:
<http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/icofx-buffer-overflow-vulnerability>
Date published: 2013-12-10
Date of last update: 2013-12-10
Vendors contacted: IcoFX Software
Release mode: User release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-4988

3. *Vulnerability Description*

IcoFX [1] is prone to a (client side) security vulnerability when

   . Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

There was no official answer from vendor after several attempts to
report this vulnerability (see [Sec. 8]). As mitigation action, given
that this is a client-side vulnerability, avoid to open untrusted ICO
files. Contact vendor for further information.

6. *Credits*

IcoFX Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

PoC: https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb-bin-sploits/-/raw/main/bin-sploits/30208.zip

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: IcoFX Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-1107
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/icofx-buffer-overflow-vulnerability
Date published: 2013-12-10
Date of last update: 2013-12-10
Vendors contacted: IcoFX Software
Release mode: User release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-4988

3. *Vulnerability Description*

IcoFX [1] is prone to a (client side) security vulnerability when
processing .ICO files. This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine, by enticing
the user of IcoFX to open a specially crafted icon file.

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . IcoFX v2.5.0.0 for Windows.
   . Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

There was no official answer from vendor after several attempts to
report this vulnerability (see [Sec. 8]). As mitigation action, given
that this is a client-side vulnerability, avoid to open untrusted ICO
files. Contact vendor for further information.

6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Marcos Accossatto
from Core Exploit Writers Team. The publication of this advisory was
coordinated by Fernando Miranda from Core Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Below is shown the result of opening the maliciously crafted file
'CORE-2013-1107-icofx-poc.ico'[2] on Windows XP SP3 (EN).

The vulnerable function is located in 0x80D9F8. By loading the PoC, the
loop [0x80DA74, 0x80DA93] fills the buffer and overwrite the Exception
Handler:

/-----

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
