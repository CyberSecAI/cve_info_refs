## Synopsis

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1851)

## Topic

An updated Grid component package that fixes multiple security issues is
now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

[Updated 17 December 2013]
This erratum previously incorrectly listed RubyGems issues CVE-2012-2125,
CVE-2012-2126 and CVE-2013-4287 as addressed by this update. However,
the rubygems component is not included as part of Red Hat Enterprise MRG
2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and is only included as part of Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. These issues were
corrected there via RHSA-2013:1852.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

MRG Grid provides high-throughput computing and enables enterprises to
achieve higher peak computing capacity as well as improved infrastructure
utilization by leveraging their existing technology to build high
performance grids. MRG Grid provides a job-queueing mechanism, scheduling
policy, and a priority scheme, as well as resource monitoring and resource
management. Users submit their jobs to MRG Grid, where they are placed into
a queue. MRG Grid then chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a
policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user
upon completion.

A flaw was found in the way cumin enforced user roles, allowing an
unprivileged cumin user to access a range of resources without having the
appropriate role. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to
access privileged information, and perform a variety of privileged
operations. (CVE-2013-4404)

It was found that multiple forms in the cumin web interface did not protect
against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker
could trick a user, who is logged into the cumin web interface, into
visiting a specially crafted URL, the attacker could perform actions in the
context of the logged in user. (CVE-2013-4405)

It was found that cumin did not properly escape input from the "Max
allowance" field in the "Set limit" form of the cumin web interface.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks against victims by tricking them into visiting a specially crafted
URL. (CVE-2013-4414)

A flaw was found in the way cumin parsed POST request data. A remote
attacker could potentially use this flaw to perform SQL injection attacks
on cumin's database. (CVE-2013-4461)

The CVE-2013-4404, CVE-2013-4405, CVE-2013-4414, and CVE-2013-4461 issues
were discovered by Tomáš Nováčik of the Red Hat MRG Quality Engineering
team.

All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

relevant to your system have been applied.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1852)

## Topic

Updated Grid component packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

MRG Grid provides high-throughput computing and enables enterprises to
achieve higher peak computing capacity as well as improved infrastructure
utilization by leveraging their existing technology to build high
performance grids. MRG Grid provides a job-queueing mechanism, scheduling
policy, and a priority scheme, as well as resource monitoring and resource
management. Users submit their jobs to MRG Grid, where they are placed into
a queue. MRG Grid then chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a
policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user
upon completion.

It was found that, when using RubyGems, the connection could be redirected
from HTTPS to HTTP. This could lead to a user believing they are installing
a gem via HTTPS, when the connection may have been silently downgraded to
HTTP. (CVE-2012-2125)

It was found that RubyGems did not verify SSL connections. This could lead
to man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-2126)

It was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an
unsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process
a version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial
of service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)

A flaw was found in the way cumin enforced user roles, allowing an
unprivileged cumin user to access a range of resources without having the
appropriate role. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to
access privileged information, and perform a variety of privileged
operations. (CVE-2013-4404)

It was found that multiple forms in the cumin web interface did not protect
against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker
could trick a user, who is logged into the cumin web interface, into
visiting a specially crafted URL, the attacker could perform actions in the
context of the logged in user. (CVE-2013-4405)

It was found that cumin did not properly escape input from the "Max
allowance" field in the "Set limit" form of the cumin web interface.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks against victims by tricking them into visiting a specially crafted
URL. (CVE-2013-4414)

A flaw was found in the way cumin parsed POST request data. A remote
attacker could potentially use this flaw to perform SQL injection attacks
on cumin's database. (CVE-2013-4461)

Red Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting CVE-2013-4287.
Upstream acknowledges Damir Sharipov as the original reporter of
CVE-2013-4287. The CVE-2013-4404, CVE-2013-4405, CVE-2013-4414, and
CVE-2013-4461 issues were discovered by Tomáš Nováčik of the Red Hat MRG
Quality Engineering team.

All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.
