Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A double-free memory corruption vulnerability exists in the `omelasticsearch` plugin of rsyslog. Specifically, the `rendered` variable in the `writeDataError` function is freed twice.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double Free: The core issue is a double free vulnerability, where the same memory location is freed twice, leading to heap corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** A remote attacker can crash rsyslog.
- **Possible Code Execution:** If an attacker can manipulate JSON responses from ElasticSearch and control memory between subsequent `free` calls, it may lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **JSON Manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate JSON responses from ElasticSearch to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send malicious JSON responses to the rsyslog server via the ElasticSearch plugin.
- The vulnerability is present when the "errorfile" parameter is explicitly set in the rsyslog configuration, which is not the default configuration.

**Affected Versions:**
- rsyslog 7.4.0 stable <= 7.4.1 stable
- rsyslog 7.3.2 devel <= 7.5.1 devel

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to rsyslog version 7.4.2 stable or 7.5.2 (or later).
- As a workaround, disable the "errorfile" configuration parameter.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability only occurs when the `errorfile` parameter is explicitly set, not when using the default configuration.
- The vulnerability was discovered during a code review.
