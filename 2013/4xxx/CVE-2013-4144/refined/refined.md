**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Object Injection:** The `buttonImageURL` parameter can be used to load an external URL which is then processed in a way that leads to object injection.
- **Lack of input validation:** There is no proper validation or sanitization of the `buttonImageURL` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided links indicates the vulnerability can be used for spoofing, and potentially other issues.
- The vulnerability could be exploited to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks (CSRF), as referenced by CVE-2013-4146.
- The injected object can potentially perform malicious actions within the context of the Flash plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL for the swfupload.swf file and injecting malicious code through the `buttonImageURL` parameter.
- The attacker needs to lure the victim into accessing the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs that leverage the vulnerable parameter.
- The attacker needs to find websites using the vulnerable version of SWFUpload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested successfully on WordPress 3.5.2, indicating that WordPress was using a vulnerable version of SWFUpload.
- The suggested mitigations include removing the `buttonImageURL` parameter, restricting its use to same-origin URLs, or ignoring the issue (which is not recommended).
- This vulnerability is publicly disclosed and has been known since at least April 2013.
