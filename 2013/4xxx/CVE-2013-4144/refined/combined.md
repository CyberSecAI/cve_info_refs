Subject: SWFUpload <= (Object Injection/CSRF) Vulnerabilities Multiple flaws

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This was brought to my attention by Jay Turla <shipcodez@...il.com>,
after some searching I found:

<http://bot24.blogspot.ca/2013/04/swfupload-object-injectioncsrf.html>

and after testing (it works). So please use:

CVE-2013-4144 swfupload KedAns-Dz object injection
CVE-2013-4145 swfupload KedAns-Dz XSS
CVE-2013-4146 swfupload KedAns-Dz CSRF

Also alerting WordPress. Remember folks, if you spot a security
advisory in the wild without a CVE, tell us so we can tag and release
it and track it more easily! And also get it fixed.

## Description

[![@reedloden](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/352251?u=8ec37a0f743b2d4c0ab12c95a504715d746779f1&v=4&size=48)](/reedloden)[reedloden](https://github.com/reedloden)opened [on Jul 3, 2013](https://github.com/WordPress/secure-swfupload/issues/1#issue-16332126)

I've received a few reports today of an image object injection problem in swfupload affecting WordPress. I'm filing this public issue here after contacting swfupload-security@wordpress.org and being asked to do so (as this issue is already public knowledge).

There's an object injection "vulnerability" in swfupload, as shown by this demo URL:

<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/js/swfupload/swfupload.swf?buttonImageURL=http://1337day.com/img/logo_green.jpg>

Known advisories for this issue:

<http://1337day.com/exploit/20669>

<http://bot24.blogspot.com/2013/04/swfupload-object-injectioncsrf.html>

This was tested on WordPress 3.5.2.

As discussed on e-mail, there are three basic options:

* Remove buttonImageURL
* Restrict buttonImageURL to same origin
* Ignore the issue

My recommendation would be to restrict buttonImageURL to the same origin as the blog site, as swfupload is already deprecated, and I'd rather it be secure but slightly broken than have a known issue that could be used for spoofing or other issues.

Thanks!
