  "CVE-2013-4287": {
    "description": "RubyGems validates versions with a regular expression that is vulnerable to denial of service due to a backtracking regular expression. For specially crafted RubyGems versions, attackers can cause denial of service through CPU consumption.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a regular expression used for validating gem versions which is susceptible to backtracking, leading to excessive CPU consumption.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Algorithmic complexity",
        "Denial of Service (DoS)",
        "Regular expression backtracking"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service through excessive CPU consumption when processing specially crafted RubyGems versions, which can impact packaging gems and other operations.",
      "attack_vector": "Specially crafted RubyGems version strings that cause the vulnerable regex to backtrack excessively, leading to DoS.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted RubyGems version string, either by controlling the gemspec used during gem packaging or directly sending it to Gem::Version API calls.",
      "affected_versions": [
          "RubyGems versions 2.0.7 and older, 2.1.0.rc.1 and 2.1.0.rc.2",
          "Ruby versions 1.9.0 through 2.0.0p247 (due to embedded vulnerable RubyGems)"

          "`gem build`",

          "Users of bundler installing gems from git are vulnerable if a malicious author changes the gemspec to an invalid version."

      "resolution": "The vulnerability can be fixed by changing the first grouping to an atomic grouping in `Gem::Version::VERSION_PATTERN` in `lib/rubygems/version.rb`."
