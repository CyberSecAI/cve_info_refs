```
The Gem::Version regexp used backtracking to validate gem versions.
This could cause excessive CPU usage when creating Gem::Version objects
including when packaging gems. See [CVE-2013-4287](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9j7m-rjqx-48vh "CVE-2013-4287").txt (in this commit)
for details.

Fixes [#626](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/626)

|  |  | = Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in RubyGems 2.0.7 and older |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | RubyGems validates versions with a regular expression that is vulnerable to |
|  |  | denial of service due to a backtracking regular expression. For specially |
|  |  | crafted RubyGems versions attackers can cause denial of service through CPU |
|  |  | consumption. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | RubyGems versions 2.0.7 and older, 2.1.0.rc.1 and 2.1.0.rc.2 are vulnerable. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Ruby versions 1.9.0 through 2.0.0p247 are vulnerable as they contain embedded |
|  |  | versions of RubyGems. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | It does not appear to be possible to exploit this vulnerability by installing a |
|  |  | gem for RubyGems 1.8.x or 2.0.x. Vulnerable uses of RubyGems API include |
|  |  | packaging a gem (through `gem build`, Gem::Package or Gem::PackageTask), |
|  |  | sending user input to Gem::Version.new, Gem::Version.correct? or use of the |
|  |  | Gem::Version::VERSION\_PATTERN or Gem::Version::ANCHORED\_VERSION\_PATTERN |
|  |  | constants. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Notably, users of bundler that install gems from git are vulnerable if a |
|  |  | malicious author changes the gemspec to an invalid version. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The vulnerability can be fixed by changing the first grouping to an atomic |
|  |  | grouping in Gem::Version::VERSION\_PATTERN in lib/rubygems/version.rb. For |
|  |  | RubyGems 2.0.x: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - VERSION\_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)\*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)\*)?' # :nodoc: |
|  |  | + VERSION\_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(?>\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)\*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)\*)?' # :nodoc: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For RubyGems 1.8.x: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - VERSION\_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)\*' # :nodoc: |
|  |  | + VERSION\_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(?>\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)\*' # :nodoc: |

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2013-4287 Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in RubyGems 2.0.7 and older

by Eric Hodel

RubyGems validates versions with a regular expression that is vulnerable to
denial of service due to backtracking. For specially crafted RubyGems
versions attackers can cause denial of service through CPU consumption.

RubyGems versions 2.0.7 and older, 2.1.0.rc.1 and 2.1.0.rc.2 are vulnerable.

RubyGems versions [2.1.0](/2013/09/09/2.1.0-released.html), [2.0.8](/2013/09/09/2.0.8-released.html), [1.8.26](/2013/09/09/1.8.26-released.html) and
[1.8.23.1](/2013/09/09/1.8.23.1-released.html) contain fixes.

Ruby versions 1.9.0 through 2.0.0p247 are vulnerable as they contain embedded
versions of RubyGems.

It does not appear to be possible to exploit this vulnerability by installing a
gem for RubyGems 1.8.x or 2.0.x. Vulnerable uses of RubyGems API include
packaging a gem (through `gem build`, Gem::Package or Gem::PackageTask),
sending user input to Gem::Version.new, Gem::Version.correct? or use of the
Gem::Version::VERSION\_PATTERN or Gem::Version::ANCHORED\_VERSION\_PATTERN
constants.

Notably, users of bundler that install gems from git are vulnerable if a
malicious author changes the gemspec to an invalid version.

The vulnerability can be fixed by changing the first grouping to an atomic
grouping in Gem::Version::VERSION\_PATTERN in lib/rubygems/version.rb. For
RubyGems 2.0.x:

```
*  VERSION_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?' # :nodoc:
+  VERSION_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(?>\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?' # :nodoc:

```

For RubyGems 1.8.x:

```
*  VERSION_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*' # :nodoc:
+  VERSION_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(?>\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*' # :nodoc:

```

## Synopsis

Moderate: rubygems security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1441)

## Topic

An updated rubygems package that fixes three security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third-party
libraries.

It was found that RubyGems did not verify SSL connections. This could lead
to man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-2126)

It was found that, when using RubyGems, the connection could be redirected
from HTTPS to HTTP. This could lead to a user believing they are installing
a gem via HTTPS, when the connection may have been silently downgraded to
HTTP. (CVE-2012-2125)

It was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an
unsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process
a version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial
of service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)

Red Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting CVE-2013-4287.
Upstream acknowledges Damir Sharipov as the original reporter.

All rubygems users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

## Topic

Updated ruby193-ruby packages that fix one security issue are now available
for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.
RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third-party
libraries.

It was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an
unsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process
a version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial
of service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)

Red Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting this
issue. Upstream acknowledges Damir Sharipov as the original reporter.

Users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1002364#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-29 03:20:40 UTC  ``` RubyGems validates versions with a regular expression that is vulnerable to denial of service due to a backtracking regular expression.  For specially crafted RubyGems versions attackers can cause denial of service through CPU consumption.  RubyGems versions 2.0.7 and older, 2.1.0.rc.1 and 2.1.0.rc.2 are vulnerable.  Ruby versions 1.9.0 through 2.0.0p247 are vulnerable as they contain embedded versions of RubyGems.  It does not appear to be possible to exploit this vulnerability by installing a gem for RubyGems 1.8.x or 2.0.x.  Vulnerable uses of RubyGems API include packaging a gem (through `gem build`, Gem::Package or Gem::PackageTask), sending user input to Gem::Version.new, Gem::Version.correct? or use of the Gem::Version::VERSION_PATTERN or Gem::Version::ANCHORED_VERSION_PATTERN constants.  The vulnerability can be fixed by changing the first grouping to an atomic grouping in Gem::Version::VERSION_PATTERN.  For RubyGems 2.0.x:  -  VERSION_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?' # :nodoc: +  VERSION_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(?>\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?' # :nodoc:   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting this vulnerability.

*Learn how RubyGems works, and how to make your own.*

The RubyGems software allows you to easily
download, install, and use ruby software packages on your system. The
software package is called a “gem” which contains a packaged Ruby
application or library.

Gems can be used to extend or modify
functionality in Ruby applications. Commonly they’re used to distribute
reusable functionality that is shared with other Rubyists for use in
their applications and libraries. Some gems provide command line
utilities to help automate tasks and speed up your work.

* New features should be coupled with tests.
* Ensure that your code blends well with ours (eg, no trailing whitespace, match indentation and coding style).
* Don’t modify the history file or version number.
* If you have any questions, just ask us on [Bundler.io Slack](https://slack.bundler.io/) or file [an issue](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues).

[RubyGems Mirror](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems-mirror)

The current state of mirroring RubyGems is frankly embarrassing. We need
RubyGems to be highly available all over the world, no more excuses! Discussion
is going on in the [rubygems-mirror

## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

```
The Gem::Version regexp used backtracking to validate gem versions.
This could cause excessive CPU usage when creating Gem::Version objects
including when packaging gems.  See [CVE-2013-4287](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9j7m-rjqx-48vh "CVE-2013-4287").txt (in this commit)
for details.

Fixes [#626](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/626)

|  |  | = Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in RubyGems 2.0.7 and older |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | RubyGems validates versions with a regular expression that is vulnerable to |
|  |  | denial of service due to a backtracking regular expression. For specially |
|  |  | crafted RubyGems versions attackers can cause denial of service through CPU |
|  |  | consumption. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | RubyGems versions 2.0.7 and older, 2.1.0.rc.1 and 2.1.0.rc.2 are vulnerable. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Ruby versions 1.9.0 through 2.0.0p247 are vulnerable as they contain embedded |
|  |  | versions of RubyGems. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | It does not appear to be possible to exploit this vulnerability by installing a |
|  |  | gem for RubyGems 1.8.x or 2.0.x. Vulnerable uses of RubyGems API include |
|  |  | packaging a gem (through `gem build`, Gem::Package or Gem::PackageTask), |
|  |  | sending user input to Gem::Version.new, Gem::Version.correct? or use of the |
|  |  | Gem::Version::VERSION\_PATTERN or Gem::Version::ANCHORED\_VERSION\_PATTERN |
|  |  | constants. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Notably, users of bundler that install gems from git are vulnerable if a |
|  |  | malicious author changes the gemspec to an invalid version. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The vulnerability can be fixed by changing the first grouping to an atomic |
|  |  | grouping in Gem::Version::VERSION\_PATTERN in lib/rubygems/version.rb. For |
|  |  | RubyGems 2.0.x: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - VERSION\_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)\*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)\*)?' # :nodoc: |
|  |  | + VERSION\_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(?>\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)\*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)\*)?' # :nodoc: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For RubyGems 1.8.x: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - VERSION\_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)\*' # :nodoc: |
|  |  | + VERSION\_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(?>\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)\*' # :nodoc: |

Subject: CVE-2013-4287 Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in RubyGems 2.0.7 and older

RubyGems validates versions with a regular expression that is vulnerable to
denial of service due to backtracking.  For specially crafted RubyGems
versions attackers can cause denial of service through CPU consumption.

RubyGems versions 2.0.7 and older, 2.1.0.rc.1 and 2.1.0.rc.2 are vulnerable.

Ruby versions 1.9.0 through 2.0.0p247 are vulnerable as they contain embedded
versions of RubyGems.

It does not appear to be possible to exploit this vulnerability by installing a
gem for RubyGems 1.8.x or 2.0.x.  Vulnerable uses of RubyGems API include
packaging a gem (through `gem build`, Gem::Package or Gem::PackageTask),
sending user input to Gem::Version.new, Gem::Version.correct? or use of the
Gem::Version::VERSION_PATTERN or Gem::Version::ANCHORED_VERSION_PATTERN
constants.

Notably, users of bundler that install gems from git are vulnerable if a
malicious author changes the gemspec to an invalid version.

The vulnerability can be fixed by changing the first grouping to an atomic
grouping in Gem::Version::VERSION_PATTERN in lib/rubygems/version.rb.  For
RubyGems 2.0.x:

  -  VERSION_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?' # :nodoc:
  +  VERSION_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(?>\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?' # :nodoc:

For RubyGems 1.8.x:

  -  VERSION_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*' # :nodoc:
  +  VERSION_PATTERN = '[0-9]+(?>\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*' # :nodoc:

This vulnerability was discovered by Damir Sharipov <dammer2k@...il.com>

## Topic

Updated ruby193-ruby packages that fix one security issue are now available
for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
has features to process text files and to do system management
tasks. RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing
third-party libraries.

It was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an
unsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process
a version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial
of service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)

Red Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting
CVE-2013-4287. Upstream acknowledges Damir Sharipov as the original
reporter.

All ruby193-ruby users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1852)

## Topic

Updated Grid component packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

MRG Grid provides high-throughput computing and enables enterprises to
achieve higher peak computing capacity as well as improved infrastructure
utilization by leveraging their existing technology to build high
performance grids. MRG Grid provides a job-queueing mechanism, scheduling
policy, and a priority scheme, as well as resource monitoring and resource
management. Users submit their jobs to MRG Grid, where they are placed into
a queue. MRG Grid then chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a
policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user
upon completion.

It was found that, when using RubyGems, the connection could be redirected
from HTTPS to HTTP. This could lead to a user believing they are installing
a gem via HTTPS, when the connection may have been silently downgraded to
HTTP. (CVE-2012-2125)

It was found that RubyGems did not verify SSL connections. This could lead
to man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-2126)

It was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an
unsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process
a version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial
of service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)

A flaw was found in the way cumin enforced user roles, allowing an
unprivileged cumin user to access a range of resources without having the
appropriate role. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to
access privileged information, and perform a variety of privileged
operations. (CVE-2013-4404)

It was found that multiple forms in the cumin web interface did not protect
against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker
could trick a user, who is logged into the cumin web interface, into
visiting a specially crafted URL, the attacker could perform actions in the
context of the logged in user. (CVE-2013-4405)

It was found that cumin did not properly escape input from the "Max
allowance" field in the "Set limit" form of the cumin web interface.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks against victims by tricking them into visiting a specially crafted
URL. (CVE-2013-4414)

A flaw was found in the way cumin parsed POST request data. A remote
attacker could potentially use this flaw to perform SQL injection attacks
on cumin's database. (CVE-2013-4461)
