Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4468:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure use of the `passthru()` function in the `agc/manager_send.php` file. Specifically, user-supplied input in the `$extension` variable is not sanitized before being passed to the `passthru()` function, allowing for OS command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** Unsanitized input passed to `passthru()` allows execution of arbitrary OS commands on the server.
*   **SQL Injection:** A separate SQL injection vulnerability in the same file (`agc/manager_send.php`) is used to bypass session validation, which is necessary to reach the vulnerable command injection code. This vulnerability exists in line 285: `$stmt="SELECT count(*) from web_client_sessions where session_name='$session_name' and server_ip='$server_ip';";`
*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** Default user accounts with hardcoded passwords ('VDAD/donotedit', 'VDCL/donotedit') allow bypassing authentication checks to reach the vulnerable code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user.
*   **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to full system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and other malicious activities.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Output of executed commands is returned to the attacker, potentially disclosing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/agc/manager_send.php` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The following parameters are necessary for the exploit:
    *   `enable_sipsak_messages=1`
    *   `allow_sipsak_messages=1`
    *   `protocol=sip`
    *   `ACTION=OriginateVDRelogin`
    *   `session_name` (any value at least 12 bytes long)
    *  `server_ip=' OR '1' = '1` (exploiting the SQL injection)
    *   `user=VDCL` or `VDAD`
    *   `pass=donotedit`
    *   `extension=;[command];` (injecting the command, e.g., `;id;uname -a;`)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target VICIdial server.
*   **VICIdial knowledge:**  The attacker needs to know the default credentials and the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit utilizes a SQL injection vulnerability to bypass session validation.
*   The hard-coded default user credentials are used to bypass the initial authentication.
*   The output of the injected commands is included in the HTTP response body.
*   The vulnerability affects VICIdial versions 2.7RC1, 2.7, and 2.8-403a, and potentially other versions as well.
* The exploit can be performed without an existing valid session
*   The exploit is demonstrated using a Metasploit module.
