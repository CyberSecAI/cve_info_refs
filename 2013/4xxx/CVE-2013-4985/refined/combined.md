Vivotek IP Cameras RTSP Authentication Bypass

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Vivotek IP Cameras RTSP Authentication Bypass
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-0704
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/vivotek-ip-cameras-rtsp-authentication-bypass
Date published: 2013-11-05
Date of last update: 2013-11-05
Vendors contacted: Vivotek
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Authentication issues [CWE-287]
Impact: Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2013-4985

3. *Vulnerability Description*

A security vulnerability was found in Vivotek IP cameras [1] that could
allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass the RTSP basic
authentication and access the video stream.

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . Vivotek IP cameras with firmware 0105a.
   . Vivotek IP cameras with firmware 0105b.
   . This vulnerability was tested against Vivotek IP cameras IP7160,
IP7361 and IP8332. Other Vivotek cameras and firmware are probably
affected too, but they were not checked.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Vendor released the beta firmware 0301c [2] and notifies that it should
be the formal release [2013-10-28]; contact vendor for further
information. Some mitigation actions for this issue may be:

   . Do not expose the camera to internet unless absolutely necessary.
   . Filter RTSP traffic (default port 554) if possible.

6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Martin Di Paola from
Core Security QA Team. The PoC of was made by Martin Di Paola with help
of Martin Rocha from Core Development Team. The publication of this
advisory was coordinated by Fernando Miranda from Core Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

7.1. *RTSP Authentication Bypass*

This vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted RTSP
packets to remote TCP port 554. In order to run the proof of concept,
follow the next steps:

   1. Set the camera RTSP authentication to 'basic'.
   2. (Assuming that the camera is located in 192.168.1.1) Run 'poc.py'
with these parameters: 'python poc.py 9999 192.168.1.1 554'
   3. Open a VLC media player and go to: 'Media > Open Network Stream'.
   4. Enter the following network URL: 'rtsp://localhost:9999/live.sdp'.
   5. A dialog box will asks for user/password, just click 'OK'.
   6. You should see the RTSP live video stream; i.e., the RTSP basic
authentication can by bypassed by a remote attacker.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
