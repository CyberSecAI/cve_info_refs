- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly validate authentication credentials in the RTSP protocol implementation of Vivotek IP cameras, allowing an attacker to bypass basic authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the improper handling of authentication within the RTSP implementation, specifically a bypass of basic authentication. The vulnerability is classified as an "Authentication issue" [CWE-287]
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unauthenticated remote attacker can bypass the RTSP basic authentication and gain unauthorized access to the camera's video stream. This allows for unauthorized viewing of the video feed.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to send specially crafted RTSP packets to the camera's TCP port 554.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the camera's IP address and port 554. No prior authentication is required. The attacker can be remote.
