And while at I found the following:

[https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/+bug/1034180](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/%2Bbug/1034180)
<https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mahara-release/mahara/1.7_STABLE/revision/5831>

Which doesn't appear to be mentioned in the changelog, but the bug
report clearly states it was meant to be handled as a security issue.

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

[Find out about sharing portfolios](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137011)

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

### Bug Description

<http://www.skeletonscribe.net/2013/05/practical-http-host-header-attacks.html>

curl -H "host:cow\"onerror='alert(1)" localhost/code/mahara/htdocs/admin/ | fgrep cow

on a fresh install (not installed yet, as first page hit of installed will store it in db), will show some unescaped

that is used in init.php, to set wwwroot, and noreplyaddress

there is also a possible injection using lib/web.php, the get\_requested\_host\_name uses it, which is used by clean\_urls, and by AccessDeniedException

The attacks on $cfg->wwwroot and $cfg->noreplyaddress are only possible by sending across a specially tailored HTTP request at just the right time during the installation process. So, I'm going to call them a non-issue. Very paranoid admins can guard against these by providing a $cfg->wwwroot and $cfg->noreplyaddress directly in their config.php, but I don't think we need to remove the automatic setting of it for lazy admins.

Regarding the lib/web.php part, I see where $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'] is used by get\_requested\_host\_name(). But that function is only used two places:

1. In get\_full\_script\_path(), which is then used by AccessDeniedException()

2. In smarty(), where, if and only if $cfg->cleanurluserssubdomains is turned on, it is used to create a "fake wwwroot" for Javascript to come from.

Both of these seem to be related to Richard Mansfield's changes in May 2012 to allow for clean url user subdomains, i.e. making the clean URL for a user's address be <https://aaronw.mahara.org> . Perhaps we could strengthen this by changing get\_requested\_host\_name() so that it runs $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'] through a regular expression that makes sure it only matches a valid domain-name-compatible hostname, e.g. [a-z0-9]{2}|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]\*[a-z0-9](\.[a-z0-9]{2}|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]\*[a-z0-9])\* .

To replicate the issue with get\_requested\_host\_name():

1. Install Mahara

2. Find a user ID that doesn't exist yet (like ID 10 on a brand new installation with less than 10 users)

3. On the command line: curl -H "host:cow\"onerror='alert(1)'" -i "<http://vegas.wgtn.cat-it.co.nz/mahara/htdocs/user/view.php?id=10>"

You'll receive an HTTP 303 See Other response header, and the Location: line will include your arbitrary host string. I can't see how this is directly exploitable... but it could potentially be a building block of some sort for another attack.

with clean urls and clean url subdomains set to true

I noted through testing that if in function get\_requested\_host\_name()

If I commented out the $\_SERVER and $\_ENV checks so that I was only dealing with the part

if (false === $hostname && !empty($CFG->wwwroot)) {

}

If I set added a bad wwwroot eg.

  $CFG->wwwroot = 'htpp://www.fis^h.com?bitofatest';

before it

I would get the error as expected when navigating around site but I'd also get the links to css files using the bad url.

Would this be a problem? or is my test too manually invasive to be a 'real world' problem?

Yeah, I don't think we can too much about attacks that alter the contents of the config.php, and still less about attacks that alter the source code of other files. We mostly need to focus on attacks that are carried out via the HTTP inputs to the web server.

### Bug Description

<http://www.skeletonscribe.net/2013/05/practical-http-host-header-attacks.html>

curl -H "host:cow\"onerror='alert(1)" localhost/code/mahara/htdocs/admin/ | fgrep cow

on a fresh install (not installed yet, as first page hit of installed will store it in db), will show some unescaped

that is used in init.php, to set wwwroot, and noreplyaddress

there is also a possible injection using lib/web.php, the get\_requested\_host\_name uses it, which is used by clean\_urls, and by AccessDeniedException

The attacks on $cfg->wwwroot and $cfg->noreplyaddress are only possible by sending across a specially tailored HTTP request at just the right time during the installation process. So, I'm going to call them a non-issue. Very paranoid admins can guard against these by providing a $cfg->wwwroot and $cfg->noreplyaddress directly in their config.php, but I don't think we need to remove the automatic setting of it for lazy admins.

Regarding the lib/web.php part, I see where $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'] is used by get\_requested\_host\_name(). But that function is only used two places:

1. In get\_full\_script\_path(), which is then used by AccessDeniedException()

2. In smarty(), where, if and only if $cfg->cleanurluserssubdomains is turned on, it is used to create a "fake wwwroot" for Javascript to come from.

Both of these seem to be related to Richard Mansfield's changes in May 2012 to allow for clean url user subdomains, i.e. making the clean URL for a user's address be <https://aaronw.mahara.org> . Perhaps we could strengthen this by changing get\_requested\_host\_name() so that it runs $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'] through a regular expression that makes sure it only matches a valid domain-name-compatible hostname, e.g. [a-z0-9]{2}|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]\*[a-z0-9](\.[a-z0-9]{2}|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]\*[a-z0-9])\* .
