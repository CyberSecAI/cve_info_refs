# USN-1911-1: Little CMS vulnerability

29 July 2013

Little CMS could be made to crash if it opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [lcms2](/security/cves?package=lcms2) - Little CMS 2 color management library

## Details

It was discovered that Little CMS did not properly verify certain memory

allocations. If a user or automated system using Little CMS were tricked

into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could cause Little CMS

to crash.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [liblcms2-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lcms2)
  -
  [2.4-0ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lcms2/2.4-0ubuntu3.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [liblcms2-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lcms2)
  -
  [2.2+git20110628-2ubuntu4.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lcms2/2.2%2Bgit20110628-2ubuntu4.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [liblcms2-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lcms2)

  [2.2+git20110628-2ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lcms2/2.2%2Bgit20110628-2ubuntu3.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that

uses Little CMS to make all the necessary changes.

Subject: CVE Request: OpenJDK and lcms2 2.5 release fixes various denial of
	service issues in lcms2

Hi,

The lcms2 2.4 -> 2.5 version upgrade fixes various crashes that could be used
by attackers to crash (NULL ptr deref) programs using lcms2, like e.g. OpenJDK 7

This was found in the embedded copy within OpenJDK7 first, then merged to lcms2.

<http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/distro-pkg-dev/2013-July/023895.html>

lcms2 related issues in there:
 * S8007925: Improve cmsStageAllocLabV2ToV4curves
 * S8007926: Improve cmsPipelineDup
 * S8007927: Improve cmsAllocProfileSequenceDescription
 * S8007929: Improve CurvesAlloc
 * S8009654: Improve stability of cmsnamed

All covered by lcms2 in this commit (I think):
<https://github.com/mm2/Little-CMS/commit/91c2db7f2559be504211b283bc3a2c631d6f06d9>

These probably can get just 1 CVE, although I do not know the OpenJDK IcedTea side
of the story.

<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=826097#c9> has the research into
more of these stability commits in lcms2 by my colleague Stanislav Brabec.
Not sure if they should get seperate CVEs or not.

Ciao, Marcus

IcedTea includes the usual IcedTea patches to allow builds against
system libraries and to support more esoteric architectures. In these
releases, use of the system version of LCMS is disabled by default to
ensure the most secure version is used. Before using the system
version, please ensure it is version 2.5 or above, or it has the
S8007925, S8007926, S8007927, S8007929 and S8009654 updates listed
above.

If you find an issue with the release, please report it to our bug
database (<http://icedtea.classpath.org/bugzilla>) under the appropriate
component. Development discussion takes place on the
distro-pkg-dev at openjdk.java.net mailing list and patches are always
welcome.

Full details of the release can be found below. Note that the
unusually large number of OpenJDK changes is due to the upstream
synchronisation mentioned above.
