Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4108:

**CVE-2013-4108: Cryptocat Multiple Unspecified Minor Issues**

This CVE is a general catch-all for unspecified minor issues within Cryptocat. The provided content doesn't offer specifics about each of these minor issues but does give insight into a number of other, more serious problems. Therefore, it is not possible to give the specific root cause, impact, or attack vector for CVE-2013-4108.

However, the surrounding context from the provided text gives details on other Cryptocat vulnerabilities.

**Other Vulnerabilities Found (Not specific to CVE-2013-4108):**

*   **Weak Key Generation:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Cryptocat used small or predictable keys for Diffie-Hellman (DH) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchanges, making them vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
        *   Specifically, an issue was present in how a decimal string was masqueraded as an array of 15-bit integers when using ECDH.
        *   Later a private key was only 10^32 instead of 256^32.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Weak keys allowed for the potential decryption of group chat messages.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of past communications for group chats.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation of weak key generation during the key exchange process.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to capture or intercept network traffic. Computational resources necessary to perform the key-cracking attacks.
*  **Random Number Generation Weaknesses:**
    *   **Root Cause**: The `Cryptocat.random()` function had a bias towards zero. Furthermore, the `BigInt` library used by Cryptocat had a bug where every 15th bit in generated random numbers was zero.
    *   **Vulnerabilities**: Biased number generation; predicable bits in the random number generation for DSA and ECDSA.
    *  **Impact**:  The biased RNG was not a significant vulnerability on its own. The issue in the `BigInt` library could lead to the compromise of DSA and ECDSA keys.
    *   **Attack Vector**: Exploitation of flawed random number generation.
     *   **Required Capabilities**: The attacker would likely require many signatures to perform the attack against DSA and ECDSA due to this issue.
*   **Other Issues Mentioned (Not fully detailed):**
    *   Improper use of random data.
    *   Use of iterations or key sizes less than the minimums in PBKDF2, RSA, DH, and ECC.
    *   Timing attack possibility due to biased random number generation.

**Summary of Cryptocat issues:**

The provided text indicates that Cryptocat had multiple significant vulnerabilities related to key generation, and random number generation.

**Note:** The provided content refers to versions of Cryptocat 1.1.147 through 2.0.41 being affected by the group chat ECDH key generation weakness, and to versions before 2.1.6 for one-to-one messaging for the DSA issue.
