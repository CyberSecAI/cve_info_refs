Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-4329:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `xenlight` library (libxl) within Xen. Specifically, when IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) is disabled, `libxl` allows access to a bus-mastering-capable PCI passthrough device before the IOMMU setup is complete. This premature access leaves the system vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Order of Operations:** The core issue is that `libxl` grants access to the PCI device to the guest domain before properly setting up the IOMMU. The IOMMU is crucial for isolating and controlling device access, preventing rogue guests from performing unauthorized DMA operations.
- **Missing IOMMU Protection:** When the IOMMU is disabled, there's no mechanism to restrict the guest's DMA operations, causing the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious HVM guest can exploit this vulnerability to escalate its privileges. By gaining uncontrolled access to the PCI device, it could manipulate or access system resources normally beyond its reach.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The guest can perform arbitrary DMA operations, leading to instability, crashes, or hangs of the entire system due to wild DMA. This could interrupt services and impact other guests.
- **Wild DMA:**  The guest can perform DMA operations to arbitrary system memory, allowing data manipulation or corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **PCI Passthrough:** The attack vector involves utilizing PCI passthrough. This feature allows a guest domain to directly access and control a physical PCI device.
- **DMA Instructions:** The attack relies on the guest domain issuing DMA (Direct Memory Access) instructions to the passed-through PCI device. Without IOMMU protection, these instructions can target arbitrary memory locations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local HVM Guest User:**  The attacker needs to be a user within a HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guest domain.
- **Access to a Bus-Mastering Capable PCI Device:**  The HVM guest must have been granted access to a PCI device that is capable of bus mastering.
- **IOMMU Disabled:** The host system must be configured with IOMMU disabled. If a functioning IOMMU is present, the vulnerability is not exploitable.

**More Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to Xen versions 4.0.x through 4.2.x
- The fix involves preventing device assignment to HVM guests when no IOMMU is present.
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a bug, but further analysis identified its security implications.
- The advisory mentions that the issue was publicly disclosed on the xen-devel mailing list before it was fully understood as a security vulnerability.
