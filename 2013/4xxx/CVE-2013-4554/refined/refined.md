{
  "CVE-2013-4554": {
    "Description": "The privilege check applied to hypercall attempts by a HVM guest only refused access from ring 3; rings 1 and 2 were allowed through.",
    "Root cause": "Missing privilege check for hypercalls from rings 1 and 2 in HVM guests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Improper privilege management"
    ],
    "Impact": "Code running in the intermediate privilege rings of HVM guest OSes may be able to elevate its privileges inside the guest by careful hypercall use.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation of the hypercall interface from an intermediate ring in a HVM guest."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to execute code in privilege rings 1 or 2 of an HVM guest operating system."
  }
