Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-4428:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the Glance image caching mechanism. When an image is downloaded for the first time by an authorized user, Glance caches that image. Subsequently, if a user (even an unauthorized one) requests that same image via its UUID, the cached copy is served without re-evaluating the `download_image` policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Policy Enforcement:** The primary weakness is the failure of Glance's image cache middleware to enforce the `download_image` policy during subsequent requests for cached images. This bypasses the intended access controls.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls:**  The image cache essentially acts as an uncontrolled bypass, allowing unauthorized users to retrieve data they wouldn't be allowed to access directly through the API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive image data that was intended to be protected by the `download_image` policy. This could lead to the exposure of confidential data, intellectual property, or other sensitive content embedded in the images.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Request:** An attacker can make a direct request to the Glance API to download a cached image by its UUID.
*   **Public Images**: In the case of public images, the UUID is readily available.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the OpenStack environment. They don't need specific privileges or admin access, just a valid user account.
*   **Knowledge of Image UUID:** The attacker needs to know the UUID of the image they wish to access.
*   **Image Must Be Cached**: The image must be previously downloaded and cached by an authorized user.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions**: The vulnerability primarily affects OpenStack Folsom and Grizzly, but later information suggests that all versions with the `download_image` policy are affected.
*   **Patch:** The fix involves adding `download_image` policy enforcement to the image cache middleware, ensuring that all requests for cached images are properly authorized.
*   **Initial Response**: Initially the incorrect HTTP code was returned when the download was not authorized (200 instead of 403), which was also addressed by the patch.
*   **Red Hat Errata**: Red Hat also addressed this issue with RHSA-2013:1525, which included fixes for the security issue as well as bug fixes.
*   **Ubuntu Security Notice**: Ubuntu released USN-2003-1 to address the vulnerability, updating the `glance` package.

This CVE is about a privilege escalation vulnerability in OpenStack Glance, specifically related to image downloads and policy enforcement when images are cached. An unprivileged user can bypass intended access controls and retrieve images they shouldn't have access to.
