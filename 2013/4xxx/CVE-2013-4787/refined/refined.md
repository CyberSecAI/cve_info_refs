Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-4787

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Android applications are verified and installed. Specifically, it's related to the handling of cryptographic signatures. Android uses these signatures to ensure that application contents have not been tampered with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is the ability for an attacker to modify the contents of an Android application without invalidating its cryptographic signature. This means the system would still recognize the modified app as valid and signed by the original developer. This vulnerability is referred to as the "Master Key vulnerability".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
*   Convert legitimate applications into Trojan malware.
*   Potentially gain control over user devices.
*   Bypass Android's security model which relies on cryptographic signatures for application integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves modifying the application's contents while keeping the signature intact, thus deceiving the system. This could be done by:
*   Replacing legitimate code with malicious code.
*   Embedding malicious functionality into the legitimate application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would require the technical knowledge to:
*   Modify the application's contents.
*   Preserve the cryptographic signature to bypass the security checks.
*   They don't need to be on the device itself, they can do it before distribution.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is claimed to have existed since at least Android 1.6 and potentially affects almost all android phones released in the 4 years leading up to July 2013.
*   Google has released a patch to device manufacturers (OEMs).
*   Google Play Store's security scanning tools did not find any evidence of this vulnerability being exploited in apps on the store.
*   "Verify Apps" feature also provides protection against malicious apps downloaded outside of the Play Store.
