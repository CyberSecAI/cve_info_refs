The provided content discusses multiple XSS vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin, with CVE-2013-4996 being one of the identifiers assigned to these issues.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in various parts of the phpMyAdmin application. This allows attackers to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unescaped JavaScript event in crafted URL hash in setup/index.php
- Unescaped HTML in chart titles in Display chart view
- Unescaped HTML tags in database/user names shown in server status monitor
- Unescaped URL in phpMyAdmin logo link.
- Unescaped input in "List of trusted proxies" ajax validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- Potential session hijacking.
- Defacement of the phpMyAdmin interface.
- Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session, like stealing of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafting a malicious URL hash.
- Inserting malicious HTML in chart titles.
- Creating databases or users with names containing HTML tags.
- Configuring a malicious URL for the phpMyAdmin logo.
- Submitting malicious data to the "List of trusted proxies" ajax validation

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the phpMyAdmin interface.
- For some vulnerabilities (stored XSS), the attacker needs to have permission to create databases or users.
- For the setup vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to craft values and enter them in the setup form.
- For the logo link vulnerability, the attacker would need to have the ability to modify the phpMyAdmin configuration.
- For the version.json vulnerability the attacker needs to be able to present a crafted version.json file.
