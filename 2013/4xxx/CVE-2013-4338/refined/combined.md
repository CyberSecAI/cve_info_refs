# WordPress 3.6.1 Maintenance and Security Release

---

After [nearly 7 million downloads](https://wordpress.org/download/counter/) of WordPress 3.6, we are pleased to announce the availability of version 3.6.1. This maintenance release [fixes 13 bugs](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=3.6.1) in version 3.6, which was a very smooth release.

**WordPress 3.6.1 is also a security release for all previous WordPress versions** and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately. It addresses three issues fixed by the WordPress security team:

* Block unsafe PHP unserialization that could occur in limited situations and setups, which can lead to remote code execution. Reported by [Tom Van Goethem](http://vagosec.org/).
* Prevent a user with an Author role, using a specially crafted request, from being able to create a post ‚Äúwritten by‚Äù another user. Reported by [Anakorn Kyavatanakij](http://anakornk.wordpress.com/).
* Fix insufficient input validation that could result in redirecting or leading a user to another website. Reported by Dave Cummo, a Northrup Grumman subcontractor for the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/).

Additionally, we‚Äôve adjusted security restrictions around file uploads to mitigate the potential for cross-site scripting.

We appreciated [responsible disclosure](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security) of these issues directly to our security team. For more information on the changes, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.6.1) or consult [the list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.6?stop_rev=24972&rev=25345).

[Download WordPress 3.6.1](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.6.1.zip) or update now from the Dashboard ‚Üí Updates menu in your site‚Äôs admin area.

                 CVE-2013-5739
Debian Bug     : 722537

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and specific
fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to upgrade the
Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead of backporting
the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

CVE-2013-4338

    Unsafe PHP unserialization in wp-includes/functions.php could cause
    arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2013-4339

    Insufficient input validation could result in redirecting or leading
    a user to another website.

CVE-2013-4340

    Privilege escalation allowing an user with an author role to create
    an entry appearing as written by another user.

CVE-2013-5738

    Insufficient capabilities were required for uploading .html/.html
    files, making it easier for authenticated users to conduct cross-site
    scripting attacks (XSS) using crafted html file uploads.

CVE-2013-5739

    Default Wordpress configuration allowed file upload for .swf/.exe
    files, making it easier for authenticated users to conduct cross-site
    scripting attacks (XSS).

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1+dfsg-1~deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1+dfsg-1~deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

* [WordPress Lessons](/support/article/wordpress-lessons/)

## [Summary](#summary)

From the¬†[announcement post](https://wordpress.org/news/2013/09/wordpress-3-6-1/), this maintenance release addresses 13 bugs with version 3.6.

Additionally: Version 3.6.1 fixes three security issues:

* Remote Code Execution: Block unsafe PHP de-serialization that could occur in limited situations and setups, which can lead to remote code execution. Reported by Tom Van Goethem. CVE-2013-4338.
* Link Injection / Open Redirect: Fix insufficient input validation that could result in redirecting or leading a user to another website. Reported by Dave Cummo, a Northrup Grumman subcontractor for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CVE-2013-4339.
* Privilege Escalation: Prevent a user with an Author role, using a specially crafted request, from being able to create a post ‚Äúwritten by‚Äù another user. Reported by Anakorn Kyavatanakij. CVE-2013-4340.

Additional security hardening:

* Updated security restrictions around file uploads to mitigate the potential for cross-site scripting. The extensions .swf and .exe are no longer allowed by default, and .htm and .html are only allowed if the user has the ability to use unfiltered HTML.

A full log of the changes made for 3.6.1 can be found at¬†<https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.6?stop_rev=24972&rev=25345>.
