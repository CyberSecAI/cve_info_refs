```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The getaddrinfo function in glibc has a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, when processing entries that map to a long list of AF_INET6 addresses, the function fails to properly allocate space, causing a buffer overflow on the stack.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow",
    "Insufficient buffer size allocation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) by sending crafted hostnames or IP addresses that result in a large number of AF_INET6 address results, leading to a crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a network attack by sending a crafted hostname or IP address.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests that involve DNS lookups. No authentication is needed."
