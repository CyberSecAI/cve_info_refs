  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-4151",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `virtio_load` function within `virtio/virtio.c`. During state loading, the code reads a value for 'num' from the savevm data which represents the number of virtqueues. Subsequently, it iterates 'num' times, reading a queue size from savevm data and writing it into the vdev->vq[i].vring.num. However, 'num' is not validated against the maximum number of virtqueues allowed (VIRTIO_PCI_QUEUE_MAX), leading to an out-of-bounds write if 'num' is larger.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds write",
        "Lack of input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can corrupt QEMU process memory on the destination host, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Altering savevm data on disk",
        "Altering savevm data over the wire during migration"
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the savevm data, either on disk or during migration. This could involve a compromised source host or a man-in-the-middle attack during migration."
    },
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-6399",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by reading `vdev->queue_sel` from the wire (migration data) and using it as an index into `vdev->vq[]`. If `vdev->queue_sel` exceeds the bounds of `vdev->vq[]`, which is allocated to `VIRTIO_PCI_QUEUE_MAX` elements, subsequent PIO operations (e.g., `VIRTIO_PCI_QUEUE_PFN`) can result in a buffer overrun.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Buffer overrun",
             "Improper index validation"
