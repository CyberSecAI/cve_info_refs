Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Varnish Cache handles certain GET requests. Specifically, when a GET request includes trailing whitespace characters but no URI, it can trigger a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input validation: Varnish does not correctly handle GET requests with trailing whitespace and missing URIs.
- Lack of error handling: The software fails to gracefully handle the malformed request leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): A successful attack causes Varnish child processes to crash.
- Temporary caching outage: The crash of child processes results in a temporary loss of caching functionality, impacting performance and potentially availability of the services relying on the Varnish cache.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the Varnish server.
- HTTP GET requests with trailing whitespace and no URI are the specific triggers

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted Varnish instance.
- No specific user privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects various versions of Varnish Cache.
- Patches were released by several distributions, including openSUSE and Debian, to address the issue.
- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2013-4484.
