Celebrating the 18th anniversary of Varnish-Cache and the first
anniversary of the [SLASH/](https://gitlab.com/uplex/varnish/slash/-/blob/master/README.rst) storage engines today, your Open-Source
Varnish-Cache friends from [UPLEX](https://uplex.de/) have just tagged the first version
1.0.0 candidate of our extension with storage engines (stevedores) and
storage routers (loadmasters).

Over the past year, we have received a lot of helpful input from our
users and have implemented substantial improvements. THANK YOU to
everyone who has contributed by reporting issues, providing feedback
and, just recently, adding documentation. SLASH/fellow has also helped
improve Varnish-Cache itself.

After rigorous testing in particular over the past weeks, we now
boldly claim that SLASH/ deserves a 1.0 version tag.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY Varnish-Cache!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY SLASH/buddy and SLASH/fellow!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : varnish
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4484
Debian Bug     : 728989

A denial of service vulnerability was reported in varnish, a state of
the art, high-performance web accelerator. With some configurations of
varnish a remote attacker could mount a denial of service (child-process
crash and temporary caching outage) via a GET request with trailing
whitespace characters and no URI.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.3-8+deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2-2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your varnish packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
