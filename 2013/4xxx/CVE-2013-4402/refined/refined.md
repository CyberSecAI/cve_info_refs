  "CVE-2013-4402": {
    "description": "Infinite recursion in the compressed packet parser was possible with crafted input data, which may be used to cause a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the compressed packet parser, which allows specially crafted input data to trigger infinite recursion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite recursion vulnerability in the compressed packet parser.",
         "Improper handling of crafted OpenPGP messages."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to excessive resource consumption caused by the infinite recursion.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted OpenPGP messages can be sent to vulnerable GnuPG implementations.",
       "Processing of incoming data by GPG, or any application using it"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input data which will trigger the vulnerable code path.",
      "additional_information": [
          "The vulnerability was discovered by Taylor R. Campbell, who found a way to generate OpenPGP packages that force GPG to recursively parse message parts indefinitely.",
          "A temporary mitigation can be implemented using `ulimit -v` to limit resource use"
      ]
