Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4746:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2013-4746 as part of a larger security bulletin, specifically mentioning "Several vulnerabilities in third-party TYPO3 extensions." Therefore, the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `myquizpoll` TYPO3 extension contains vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The extension is susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The extension is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL injection could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the application's database.
    *  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful XSS attacks can lead to malicious script injection into web pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is over the network, as SQL injection and XSS attacks are typically initiated through crafted requests to the web application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance. For the XSS, an attacker may need to be logged in.
    *   The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL and web application vulnerabilities, in order to craft a successful attack.
    * The attacker would likely need to target the vulnerable application via the web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content specifies that the vulnerability affects `myquizpoll` versions 2.0.0 and below.
*   A fix is available in version 2.0.6 of the extension, which users are recommended to upgrade to.
*   The provided CVSS v2.0 score indicates a critical impact for SQL Injection attacks and high for XSS with an overall high severity.
* The specific CVSS v2.0 vector string `AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C` indicates the following:
    *   AV:N (Attack Vector: Network)
    *   AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   Au:S (Authentication: Single)
    *   C:C (Confidentiality Impact: Complete)
    *   I:P (Integrity Impact: Partial)
    *   A:N (Availability Impact: None)
    *  E:P (Exploitability: Proof of Concept)
    *  RL:O (Remediation Level: Official Fix)
    *  RC:C (Report Confidence: Confirmed)
*  The information provided is consistent with the general understanding of SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities, and provides sufficient context to understand the security risks.

In summary, the content highlights that the `myquizpoll` extension is vulnerable to SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting attacks and recommends users to update to version 2.0.6 or higher to address these issues.
