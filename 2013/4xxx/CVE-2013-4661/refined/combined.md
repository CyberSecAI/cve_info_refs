# CIVI-SA-2013-003 - Custom Search Permissions

Published
2013-06-05 09:49

Written by
[totten](/users/totten "View user profile.")

CiviCRM v2+ includes a "Custom Search" system which allows administrators to register customized search forms and includes some default custom-searches (e.g. "Find Contribution Amounts by Tag"). CiviCRM also supports role-based access controls using permissions like "*access CiviContribute*" or "*access CiviEvent*". For the default custom-searches, CiviCRM does not enforce the expected role-based access controls.

For example: If a security policy grants a user permission to view the CiviCRM backend ("*access CiviCRM*") but denies permission to view contribution data ("*access CiviContribute*"), then the user may still access contribution data through a custom-search.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the access controls can only be bypassed by users with the permission "*access CiviCRM*".

Security Risk
Less Critical

Vulnerability
Access Bypass

Affected Versions

CiviCRM v2.0.0 - v4.2.9, v4.3.0 - v4.3.3

Fixed Versions

CiviCRM v4.2.10 and v4.3.4

Solutions

Any ONE of the following solutions will provide protection:

* Upgrade to CiviCRM 4.2.10 or v4.3.4+
* Disable any custom searches which should not be generally accessible by backend/staff users. (Custom searches may be disabled by navigating to "Administer => Customize Data and Screens => Manage Custom Searches".)

# CiviCRM JIRA issue archive

We have migrated from JIRA to Gitlab! New issues must be created on Gitlab at <https://lab.civicrm.org/groups/dev/-/issues>. For more information: [Gitlab roadmap](https://lab.civicrm.org/infrastructure/ops/wikis/gitlab-roadmap) and [updates on the migration status](https://lab.civicrm.org/infrastructure/ops/issues/817). Issue creation was disabled on March 31st 2018. The site was converted to a static archive on December 27 2018.

You can still access old (read-only) JIRA issues if you know their issue number.

For example: <https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21203>

You can also browse the archived issues for a specific project:

* [View all CRM issues](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM)
* [View all EXT issues](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/EXT)
* [View all VOL issues](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/VOL)
* [View all HR issues](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/HR)
