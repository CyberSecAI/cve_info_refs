Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4661:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to enforce role-based access controls for default custom searches in CiviCRM. While CiviCRM uses permissions like "*access CiviContribute*" or "*access CiviEvent*" to control access to specific components, these permissions were not being consistently applied to custom searches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Access Control Bypass:**  The primary weakness is an access control bypass. Users with the "*access CiviCRM*" permission, but specifically denied access to certain data (e.g., "*access CiviContribute*"), could still view that data through custom searches.
*   **Inconsistent Permission Enforcement:** The system inconsistently applied permissions. While permissions controlled module access, they did not consistently extend to custom searches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:**  Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. For instance, a user without the "*access CiviContribute*" permission could access contribution data through a vulnerable custom search.
*   **Potential for Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability could expose sensitive information intended to be restricted based on user roles.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Custom Search Functionality:** The attack vector is through the "Custom Search" system. Attackers would exploit the vulnerability by using a custom search to access data they do not have explicit permission to view.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to CiviCRM Backend:**  Attackers need at least "*access CiviCRM*" permission, allowing them to access the CiviCRM backend.
*   **Knowledge of Custom Search:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable custom searches that allow the bypass.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered "Less Critical" due to the requirement for the attacker to have the "*access CiviCRM*" permission, indicating that the attack is limited to users who already have some level of access to the system.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in CiviCRM versions 4.2.10 and 4.3.4.
*   Mitigation is also possible by disabling custom searches that should not be accessible to all backend users.
