Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-4426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability was caused by a misspelled variable name in the `pyxtrlock` code. Specifically, the variable `MAXGOODWILL` was misspelled as `MAXGODWILL`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Typographical error leading to incorrect program behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The typo could lead to a crash after multiple failed authentication attempts. This implies a denial-of-service vulnerability where an attacker could potentially crash the screen lock program, possibly disrupting the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector would involve repeatedly entering incorrect passwords, likely with the intent to trigger the faulty logic caused by the misspelled variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the screen lock (i.e., they would need to be at the computer, or have some form of remote access) and attempt multiple failed authentication attempts.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix was a simple typo correction, as indicated by the issue title: "Line 226 : MAXGODWILL instead of MAXGOODWILL in pyxtrlock #8"
- The vulnerability was reported by Paul Lhussiez.
- The vulnerability is present in version 0.1 of pyxtrlock and was fixed in later versions (presumably in 0.2).

In summary, CVE-2013-4426 is a relatively minor vulnerability stemming from a typo that could be exploited to crash the `pyxtrlock` screen locker.
