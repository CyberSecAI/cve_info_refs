  "CVE-2013-4185": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CveID": "CVE-2013-4185",
      "CveDescription": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way Nova handled network source security group policy updates. An authenticated user could send a large number of server creation operations, causing nova-network to become unresponsive."
    },
    "OfficialDescription": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way Nova handled network source security group policy updates. An authenticated user could send a large number of server creation operations, causing nova-network to become unresponsive.",
    "Analysis": {
      "RootCause": "The vulnerability lies in Nova's inefficient handling of network source security group policy updates, specifically how it retrieves the list of IPs. The code makes a large number of calls to get_network_info. For every instance launch, it retrieves the IP information for each rule referencing source group, and then for each instance in that source group. This leads to a quadratic increase in the number of requests made.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Algorithmic complexity vulnerability leading to excessive resource consumption"
      ],
      "Impact": "A denial-of-service (DoS) condition where `nova-network` becomes unresponsive and can no longer service other requests in a timely fashion, potentially causing instance launches to timeout.",
      "AttackVectors": [
        "An authenticated user can trigger the vulnerability by creating a large number of server instances using security groups that reference other source groups, and cause an explosion of get_network_info calls.",
         "Exploitation involves sending a large number of server creation requests to nova."
      ],
      "RequiredCapabilities": "An authenticated user with the ability to create server instances and security groups within the Nova environment is required."
    },
     "AdditionalDetails": {
        "AffectedComponents": [ "nova-network" ],
        "UnaffectedConfigurations": "Setups using Quantum are not affected.",
         "FixDetails": "The fix involves using the cached IP addresses instead of calling out to the network API multiple times. This fix is applied to master, grizzly and folsom branches.",
        "Reporter": "Vishvananda Ishaya (Nebula)",
