| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=989707#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-07-29 18:25:29 UTC  ``` Thierry Carrez (thierry) reports:  Title: Denial of Service using XML entities in Nova/Cinder extensions Reporter: Grant Murphy (Red Hat) Products: Nova, Cinder Affects: Grizzly  Description: Grant Murphy from Red Hat reported that vulnerabilities in XML request parsers were not fully patched in OSSA 2013-004. By leveraging XML entity expansion in specific extensions, an unauthenticated attacker may still consume excessive resources on the Nova or Cinder API servers, resulting in a denial of service and potentially a crash. Only Nova setups making use of the security group extension in Grizzly are affected. Only Cinder setups making use of the backups or volume transfer API extension in Grizzly are affected.

```
OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-020
CVE: CVE-2013-4185
Date: August 6, 2013
Title: Denial of Service in Nova network source security groups
Reporter: Vishvananda Ishaya (Nebula)
Products: Nova
Affects: All versions

Description:
Vishvananda Ishaya from Nebula reported a denial of service
vulnerability in Nova's handling of network source security group
policy updates. By performing a large number of server creation
operations, the proportion of updates increases quadratically and
may overwhelm nova-network such that it is no longer able to service
other requests in a timely fashion. Only setups relying on
nova-network are affected.

Havana (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/39541>

Grizzly fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/39543>

Folsom fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/39544>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the havana-3 development milestone and
in a future 2013.1.3 release.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0657)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues, several bugs,
and add an enhancement are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (code name Nova),
which provides services for provisioning, managing, and using virtual
machine instances.

A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
parser used by Nova. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
specially-crafted request to a Nova API, causing Nova to consume an
excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Nova. If a remote attacker
sent a specially-crafted request to a Nova API, it could cause Nova to
connect to external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or
allow an attacker to read files on the Nova server that are accessible to
the user running Nova. (CVE-2013-1665)

This update also fixes several bugs. The following are noteworthy changes:

* In single node, all-in-one environments where all services (such as

Nova, Glance, and Keystone) are installed and run on a single system, after
a host reboot, some instances may have automatically started again, but
soon after, automatically shut down. "Instance shutdown by itself. Calling
the stop API" messages were logged to Nova logs (in "/var/log/nova/") in
these cases. (BZ#890512)

* In environments using Quantum, after creating a network with two

subnets, removing an IP address (using "nova remove-fixed-ip"), and then
adding a fixed address (using "nova add-fixed-ip"), resulted in the
virtual machine having two IP addresses. (BZ#908373)

* Prior to this update, after converting a downloaded image to raw, the

original, downloaded image (a large .part file) was not removed. After
installing this update, the following three options must be configured in
"/etc/nova/nova.conf" to correctly resolve this issue:

remove\_unused\_base\_images=true
remove\_unused\_resized\_minimum\_age\_seconds=60
remove\_unused\_original\_minimum\_age\_seconds=60

(BZ#911103)

Additionally, this update adds the following enhancement:

* The RHSA-2013:0658 openstack-cinder update implemented a Cinder driver

that allows Red Hat Storage to be used as a back-end for Cinder volumes.
This update adds a libvirt connector to Nova, which is a requirement for
using the new Cinder driver. Note that you must manually install the
glusterfs and glusterfs-fuse packages on the Nova nodes.

Additionally, when running Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) in Enforcing
mode, the latest selinux-policy packages provided by RHBA-2013:0618 must be
installed, otherwise denials will be logged when attempting to mount Red
Hat Storage volumes. (BZ#912384)

All users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add this enhancement. After
installing the updated packages, the Nova running services will be
restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1199)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix multiple security issues and
various bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (Nova), which
provides services for provisioning, managing, and using virtual machine
instances.

It was found that the fixes for CVE-2013-1664 and CVE-2013-1665, released
via RHSA-2013:0657, did not fully correct the issues in the Extensible
Markup Language (XML) parser used by Nova. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to a Nova API, causing
Nova to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory, or possibly crash.
(CVE-2013-4179)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Nova handled network source
security group policy updates. An authenticated user could send a large
number of server creation operations, causing nova-network to become
unresponsive. (CVE-2013-4185)

An information disclosure flaw and a resource limit bypass were found in
the way Nova handled virtual hardware templates (flavors). These allowed
tenants to show and boot other tenants' flavors and bypass resource limits
enforced via the os-flavor-access:is\_public property. (CVE-2013-2256)

It was discovered that, in some configurations, certain messages in
console-log could cause nova-compute to become unresponsive, resulting in a
denial of service. (CVE-2013-4261)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
CVE-2013-2256 and CVE-2013-4185. Upstream acknowledges hzrandd from NetEase
as the original reporter of CVE-2013-2256, and Vishvananda Ishaya
from Nebula as the original reporter of CVE-2013-4185. Upstream also
acknowledges Ken'ichi Ohmichi from NEC for providing a corrected fix for
CVE-2013-2256.

The CVE-2013-4179 issue was discovered by Grant Murphy of the Red Hat
Product Security Team, and CVE-2013-4261 was discovered by Jaroslav Henner
of Red Hat.

This update also fixes a number of bugs in openstack-nova.

Additionally, openstack-nova has been rebased to the latest stable release
2013.1.3. (BZ#993100)

All users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the running Nova services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

### Bug Description

The code for retrieving the list of ips to make source security groups is very inefficient. It is possible to create a set of rules using source security groups that will lead to an explosion of get\_network\_info calls.

Example:

# create a security group

nova secgroup-create foo foo

# add source group rules referencing the same group

for i in {1..10}; do

  nova secgroup-add-group-rule foo foo tcp $i $i

done

# launch 10 instances

nova boot --flavor 1 --image precise --num-instances 10 --security-groups foo test

When each instance boots it sends out a notification to each of the other instances to update their iptables rules. Here is what happens when the 10th instance boots:

for num instances in group that is referenced in a source rule: 10

  for num rules referencing a source group: 10

    for num instances in the source group: 10

      call get\_nw\_info()

That means 1000 individual requests to get\_nw\_info for a single instance launch. In this case you have You can see how these numbers could get out of hand very quickly, for example launching 20 instances:

instance number(n) : num calls (n^2) \* 10

1 : 10

2 : 20

3 : 90

...

18 : 3240

19 : 3610

20 : 4000

...

$ python -c "print sum(n \* n \* 10 for n in xrange(1, 21))"

28700

28,700 calls to get\_network info by the time the launch completes. In reality this number of calls creates a DOS where nova-network can't respond in time and instance launches start to timeout.

There are multiple fixes needed:

a) constructing a list of all needed instances instead of making a separate request for each rule.

b) a single call to retrieve nw\_info (or at least fixed ip info) for multiple instances at once.

Not totally convinced we should issue an OSSA about this one... It's a bit of a slippery slope since authenticated users have a lot of ways to consume resources . Only wildly assymetric attacks should trigger OSSAs, but that may well be the case here.

That only affects Nova when used with nova-network (not Quantum), right ?

ttx: I'm not sure if it needs an OSSA, although this case is particularly nasty. It isn't just that you are using resources, you can cause the system to become so overloaded that all nova-computes in the system cannot respond to messages. So it basically borks the entire cloud.

It definitely sounds nasty. It seems OSSA worthy to me. I guess we could use some more opinions. Sometimes I feel overly conservative when considering DOS vulnerabilities.

If I understand this correctly, the number we're talking about is blocking rpc calls made to the network service. Starting 20 instances isn't too hard, and resulting in 28,700 rpc calls in this example is pretty darn bad.

This reasoning also takes us back to the earlier discussion about authenticated vs. unauthenticated and whether we can infer what that means for all deployers. With today's free trials and otherwise minimally vetted users I'm leaning toward disregarding that axis in appraising the severity of a risk from the project perspective.

Proposed impact description...

Title: Denial of Service in Nova network source security groups

Reporter: Vishvananda Ishaya (Nebula)

Products: Nova

Affects: All versions

Vishvananda Ishaya from Nebula reported a denial of service

vulnerability in Nova's handling of network source security group

policy updates. By performing a large number of server creation

operations, the proportion of updates increases quadratically and

may overwhelm nova-network such that it is no longer able to service

other requests in a timely fashion. Only setups relying on

nova-network are affected.

Found a much simpler solution to this after some experimenting. The original solution touches a ton of files but this one is pretty simple. It uses the cached ip addresses to construct the security group rules.

Use cached nwinfo for secgroup rules

This stops a potential DOS with source security groups by using the

    db cached version of the network info instead of calling out to

    the network api multiple times.

Fixes [bug 1184041](/bugs/1184041)

This has a side affect of breaking security group linking via source groups.

Example:

Secgroup "Server" has rule

+-------------+-----------+---------+----------+---------------+

| IP Protocol | From Port | To Port | IP Range | Source Group |

+-------------+-----------+---------+----------+---------------+

| tcp | 8140 | 8140 | | client |

+-------------+-----------+---------+----------+---------------+

Instance A is running and is associated with the "Server" secgroup

Now if a create a new instance with the "client" security group it should add a rule to instance A to all the new instance to talk to it.

This no longer gets added as it uses the cached version.

Restarting nova-compute will fix this and the rule will be applied.

@Sam: could you file a separate bug about this regression ? It will be easier to track rather than reusing the original bug.

### Bug Description

The code for retrieving the list of ips to make source security groups is very inefficient. It is possible to create a set of rules using source security groups that will lead to an explosion of get\_network\_info calls.

Example:

# create a security group

nova secgroup-create foo foo

# add source group rules referencing the same group

for i in {1..10}; do

  nova secgroup-add-group-rule foo foo tcp $i $i

done

# launch 10 instances

nova boot --flavor 1 --image precise --num-instances 10 --security-groups foo test

When each instance boots it sends out a notification to each of the other instances to update their iptables rules. Here is what happens when the 10th instance boots:

for num instances in group that is referenced in a source rule: 10

  for num rules referencing a source group: 10

    for num instances in the source group: 10

      call get\_nw\_info()

That means 1000 individual requests to get\_nw\_info for a single instance launch. In this case you have You can see how these numbers could get out of hand very quickly, for example launching 20 instances:

instance number(n) : num calls (n^2) \* 10

1 : 10

2 : 20

3 : 90

...

18 : 3240

19 : 3610

20 : 4000

...

$ python -c "print sum(n \* n \* 10 for n in xrange(1, 21))"

28700

28,700 calls to get\_network info by the time the launch completes. In reality this number of calls creates a DOS where nova-network can't respond in time and instance launches start to timeout.

There are multiple fixes needed:

a) constructing a list of all needed instances instead of making a separate request for each rule.

b) a single call to retrieve nw\_info (or at least fixed ip info) for multiple instances at once.

Not totally convinced we should issue an OSSA about this one... It's a bit of a slippery slope since authenticated users have a lot of ways to consume resources . Only wildly assymetric attacks should trigger OSSAs, but that may well be the case here.

That only affects Nova when used with nova-network (not Quantum), right ?

ttx: I'm not sure if it needs an OSSA, although this case is particularly nasty. It isn't just that you are using resources, you can cause the system to become so overloaded that all nova-computes in the system cannot respond to messages. So it basically borks the entire cloud.

It definitely sounds nasty. It seems OSSA worthy to me. I guess we could use some more opinions. Sometimes I feel overly conservative when considering DOS vulnerabilities.

If I understand this correctly, the number we're talking about is blocking rpc calls made to the network service. Starting 20 instances isn't too hard, and resulting in 28,700 rpc calls in this example is pretty darn bad.

This reasoning also takes us back to the earlier discussion about authenticated vs. unauthenticated and whether we can infer what that means for all deployers. With today's free trials and otherwise minimally vetted users I'm leaning toward disregarding that axis in appraising the severity of a risk from the project perspective.

Title: Denial of Service in Nova network source security groups

Reporter: Vishvananda Ishaya (Nebula)

Products: Nova

Affects: All versions

Vishvananda Ishaya from Nebula reported a denial of service

vulnerability in Nova's handling of network source security group

policy updates. By performing a large number of server creation

operations, the proportion of updates increases quadratically and

may overwhelm nova-network such that it is no longer able to service

other requests in a timely fashion. Only setups relying on

nova-network are affected.

Found a much simpler solution to this after some experimenting. The original solution touches a ton of files but this one is pretty simple. It uses the cached ip addresses to construct the security group rules.

Note that we're going to be unable to land anything on stable/folsom until someone picks up nova [bug 1200336](/bugs/1200336) and devises a fix (also we'll need to manually merge <https://review.openstack.org/36698> to d-g since we're deadlocked on multiple regressions in the folsom gate now).

Agreed, it looks like the same set of symptoms. I think we should open this bug public and mark that one as a duplicate, then use the normal review process to wrap things up from this point forward. Anyone disagree?

This has a side affect of breaking security group linking via source groups.

Example:

Secgroup "Server" has rule

+-------------+-----------+---------+----------+---------------+

| IP Protocol | From Port | To Port | IP Range | Source Group |

+-------------+-----------+---------+----------+---------------+

| tcp | 8140 | 8140 | | client |

+-------------+-----------+---------+----------+---------------+

Instance A is running and is associated with the "Server" secgroup

Now if a create a new instance with the "client" security group it should add a rule to instance A to all the new instance to talk to it.

This no longer gets added as it uses the cached version.

Restarting nova-compute will fix this and the rule will be applied.

@Sam: could you file a separate bug about this regression ? It will be easier to track rather than reusing the original bug.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0657)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues, several bugs,
and add an enhancement are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (code name Nova),
which provides services for provisioning, managing, and using virtual
machine instances.

A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
parser used by Nova. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
specially-crafted request to a Nova API, causing Nova to consume an
excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Nova. If a remote attacker
sent a specially-crafted request to a Nova API, it could cause Nova to
connect to external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or
allow an attacker to read files on the Nova server that are accessible to
the user running Nova. (CVE-2013-1665)

This update also fixes several bugs. The following are noteworthy changes:

* In single node, all-in-one environments where all services (such as

Nova, Glance, and Keystone) are installed and run on a single system, after
a host reboot, some instances may have automatically started again, but
soon after, automatically shut down. "Instance shutdown by itself. Calling
the stop API" messages were logged to Nova logs (in "/var/log/nova/") in
these cases. (BZ#890512)

* In environments using Quantum, after creating a network with two

subnets, removing an IP address (using "nova remove-fixed-ip"), and then
adding a fixed address (using "nova add-fixed-ip"), resulted in the
virtual machine having two IP addresses. (BZ#908373)

* Prior to this update, after converting a downloaded image to raw, the

original, downloaded image (a large .part file) was not removed. After
installing this update, the following three options must be configured in
"/etc/nova/nova.conf" to correctly resolve this issue:

remove\_unused\_base\_images=true
remove\_unused\_resized\_minimum\_age\_seconds=60
remove\_unused\_original\_minimum\_age\_seconds=60

(BZ#911103)

Additionally, this update adds the following enhancement:

* The RHSA-2013:0658 openstack-cinder update implemented a Cinder driver

that allows Red Hat Storage to be used as a back-end for Cinder volumes.
This update adds a libvirt connector to Nova, which is a requirement for
using the new Cinder driver. Note that you must manually install the
glusterfs and glusterfs-fuse packages on the Nova nodes.

Additionally, when running Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) in Enforcing
mode, the latest selinux-policy packages provided by RHBA-2013:0618 must be
installed, otherwise denials will be logged when attempting to mount Red
Hat Storage volumes. (BZ#912384)

All users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add this enhancement. After
installing the updated packages, the Nova running services will be
restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-08-05 20:14:39 UTC  ``` Jeremey Stanley (jeremy) reports:  Title: Resource limit circumvention in Nova private flavors Reporter: hzrandd (NetEase) Products: Nova Affects: All versions  hzrandd from NetEase reported a resource limit circumvention vulnerability in Nova's handling of private flavors. Any tenant is able to show and boot any other tenant's private flavors by guessing a flavor ID. This not only exposes the flavor's name, memory and disk size, swap allocation, VCPU count and similar flavor properties, but potentially allows circumvention of any resource limits enforced through the os-flavor-access:is_public property.  Havana (development branch) fix: <https://review.openstack.org/34963>  Grizzly fix: <https://review.openstack.org/37992>  Folsom fix: <https://review.openstack.org/38318>  Notes: This fix is included in the 2013.2.b2 development milestone and will appear in a future 2013.1.3 release.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-06 20:33:53 UTC  ``` This is now public:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q3/281>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2013-08-08 03:56:22 UTC  ```  Created openstack-nova tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 994809](show_bug.cgi?id=994809 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2256 openstack-nova: OpenStack: Nova private flavors resource limit circumvention [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 994810](show_bug.cgi?id=994810 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-2256 openstack-nova: OpenStack: Nova private flavors resource limit circumvention [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-21 20:36:10 UTC  ``` The previous fix was insufficient and did not fully fix the flaw, as noted here:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/+bug/1212179](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/%2Bbug/1212179)  The patch to fully correct this flaw is here (I believe it would be in addition to previously-mentioned patches):  <https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/4054cc4a22a1fea997dec76afb5646fd6c6ea6b9>  This will require a second CVE for the incomplete fix; I've asked upstream to bring this up on the oss-security list.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2013-08-22 15:56:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=993340#c5)) > The previous fix was insufficient and did not fully fix the flaw, as noted > here: >  > [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/+bug/1212179](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/%2Bbug/1212179) >  > The patch to fully correct this flaw is here (I believe it would be in > addition to previously-mentioned patches): >  > <https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/> > 4054cc4a22a1fea997dec76afb5646fd6c6ea6b9 >  > This will require a second CVE for the incomplete fix; I've asked upstream > to bring this up on the oss-security list.
