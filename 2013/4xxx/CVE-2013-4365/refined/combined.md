# [[ANNOUNCE] mod\_fcgid 2.3.9 released](/search?l=dev@httpd.apache.org&q=subject:%22%5C%5BANNOUNCE%5C%5D+mod_fcgid+2.3.9+released%22&o=newest)

[Jeff Trawick](/search?l=dev@httpd.apache.org&q=from:%22Jeff+Trawick%22)
[Tue, 08 Oct 2013 04:42:22 -0700](/search?l=dev@httpd.apache.org&q=date:20131008)

```
 The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are
  pleased to announce the release of version 2.3.9 of mod_fcgid, a
  FastCGI implementation for Apache HTTP Server versions 2.0, 2.2, and
  2.4.  This version of mod_fcgid is a security release, resolving a
  defect that could result in a denial of service with some applications.
  Other fixes and improvements are also included in this release.
```
```

  mod_fcgid is available for download from:

    <http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi#mod_fcgid>

  A full list of changes in this release follows:

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2013-4365 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fix possible heap buffer overwrite.  Reported and solved by:
     [Robert Matthews <rob tigertech.com>]

  *) Add experimental cmake-based build system for Windows.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Correctly parse quotation and escaped spaces in FcgidWrapper and the
     AAA Authenticator/Authorizor/Access directives' command line argument,
     as currently documented.  PR 51194  [William Rowe]

  *) Honor quoted FcgidCmdOptions arguments (notably for InitialEnv
     assignments).  PR 51657  [William Rowe]

  *) Conform script response parsing with mod_cgid and ensure no response
     body is sent when ap_meets_conditions() determines that request
     conditions are met.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Improve logging in access control hook functions.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Avoid making internal sub-requests and processing Location headers
     when in FCGI_AUTHORIZER mode, as the auth hook functions already
     treat Location headers returned by scripts as an error since
     redirections are not meaningful in this mode.  [Chris Darroch]

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2778-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Salvatore Bonaccorso
October 12, 2013                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : libapache2-mod-fcgid
Vulnerability  : heap-based buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4365

Robert Matthews discovered that the Apache FCGID module, a FastCGI
implementation for Apache HTTP Server, fails to perform adequate
boundary checks on user-supplied input. This may allow a remote attacker
to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1.2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-fcgid packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
