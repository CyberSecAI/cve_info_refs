The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in various SOHO routers, with some directly related to CVE-2013-4656.

**CVE-2013-4656 is specifically mentioned in the context of a Linksys EA6500 router and its SMB service misconfiguration:**

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Misconfiguration in the SMB service allows the creation of symbolic links that point to arbitrary locations outside of the Samba share.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    -  SMB service misconfiguration allowing symlink creation.
    -  Improper file permissions on the router, specifically universal read/write access to `/tmp` directory where scripts are executed.
**Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary command execution leading to a root shell on the router.
**Attack vectors:**
    -  Attacker on the local network (LAN/WLAN).
    -  Exploitation of the SMB service using symlink traversal.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    -  Local network access to the router (LAN/WLAN).
    -  Ability to connect to the SMB service (no authentication required by default).

**Additional relevant vulnerabilities and information related to SOHO router security from the provided content include:**

*   **General SOHO Router Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Many SOHO routers have a wide range of extraneous services (SMB, NetBIOS, HTTP(S), FTP, UPnP, Telnet, etc.) that increase the attack surface.
    *   These routers often lack secure channels or authentication mechanisms for services such as FTP, Telnet, and SMB.
    *   Routers are often insecure by default due to unsecured features, failure to abide by the principle of least privilege, supporting outdated technologies, disabled security protections, or weak credentials.
    *   Lack of input validation leads to vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Directory Traversal, and Command Injection.
    *   Many routers suffer from poor security design and implementation.
    *   Firmware update processes are often cumbersome, not automatic, and not user-friendly.
*   **Specific Vulnerabilities Identified:**
    *   **Buffer overflows:** In network services like the Broadcom ACSD service, and other packages such as TRENDnet KC_FTP and KC_SMB.
    *   **Unauthenticated read/write access:**  To attached storage via SMB, FTP, and other services, often with the most permissive settings.
    *   **Permissive file permissions:** Allowing read and write access to the router's root file system or sensitive files.
    *   **Service Misconfiguration:** SMB servers allowing the creation of symbolic links to arbitrary destinations, enabling file traversal.
    *   **Clear text storage of sensitive data:** Including passwords in files like `/var/passwd`.
    *   **Web attacks:** Including CSRF, Directory Traversal, and Command Injection.
    *   **Race conditions:** Vulnerabilities where external events or variables affect the behavior of a program depending on the order of occurrence.
    *   **Backdoors:** Intentional methods of bypassing authentication to gain administrative access (e.g. TRENDnet routers via specific HTTP request).

*   **Impact of Compromise:**
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks to sniff and reroute traffic.
    *   DNS poisoning.
    *   Denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Impersonation of servers.
    *   Unfettered access to exploit vulnerabilities of local area hosts.

*  **Proof of Concept Attacks:**
   *  **D-Link DIR-865L:** Exploits improper file permissions, insecure data storage, SMB misconfiguration, and a PHP file inclusion vulnerability to gain a root shell.
   *  **ASUS RT-AC66U:** Exploits a buffer overflow in the ACSD service to gain a root shell.
   *  **TRENDnet TEW-812DRU:** Exploits CSRF and command injection to gain a root shell.
    
*   **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    *   Vendors should provide secure firmware updates, enable automatic updates, and perform regular security audits.
    *   Administrators should regularly upgrade firmware, disable remote access and unused services, choose strong passwords, use WPA2 encryption, enable HTTPS, and limit inbound access.
    *   End-users should be cautious of browser warnings, avoid suspicious links, and browse safely.
