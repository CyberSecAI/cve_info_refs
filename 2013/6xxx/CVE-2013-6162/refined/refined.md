Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when handling email bodies, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. Malicious JavaScript code embedded in an email is stored on the server and executed in the context of the victim's browser when they view the email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
- **Account Hijacking/Session Theft:**  This could lead to an attacker stealing user session cookies or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could potentially use the XSS vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites and distribute malware.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might manipulate data visible to the user within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious email with embedded JavaScript in the body and sends it through the vulnerable mail server to a target user.
- **Web UI Display:** The malicious script is executed when the target user views the email via the mail server's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Email:** The attacker needs the ability to send emails to a user of the vulnerable system, typically through the vulnerable mail server itself or via a spoofed sender address.
- **Access to a Mail Server:**  The attacker requires a way to relay the crafted email through a SMTP server.
