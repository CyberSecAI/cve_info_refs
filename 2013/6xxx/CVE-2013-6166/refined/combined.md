And the problem is? Browser sends bad request and lighty sends "400 bad request" response. Seems like correct behaviour to me.

I found a place where status 400 is set. In request.c starting at line 1047:
```

default:
  if (*cur >= 0 && *cur < 32 && *cur != '\t') {
    if (srv->srvconf.log_request_header_on_error) {
      log_error_write(srv, __FILE__, __LINE__, "sds",
                      "invalid char in header", (int)*cur, "-> 400");
    }

    con->http_status = 400;
    con->keep_alive = 0;

    return 0;
  }
  break;
}

```

In my case `*char` equals to ASCII char with code 5. I excluded it from <0, 32> condition. No 400 now.
Can someone tell me is there any exposure in my solution?

Character 5 is a control character and shouldn't be in a http header.

What is the reason to reject control character from header value field?
Is there some specification that disallow it, or is it because the server can't handle control characters in futher processing?

Almost every site has installed google analytics code. This code sets some cookies specific for campaign tracking. This mechanism can be used to set any value for this cookie. Look at this url:

[www.domain.com/?utm\_source=test&utm\_medium=test&utm\_campaign=te%05st](http://www.domain.com/?utm_source=test&utm_medium=test&utm_campaign=te%05st)

when google analytics is installed on the site it will set cookie with parameters present in this url. Look at the last one. There is special character number 5 which will be saved in the cookie. Next, any requests from this visitor to this domain will end up with 400 Bad request error.

This mechanism may be used to ban the page to it's visitors. Some atacker may share this buggy link with others and the site may be blocked for many many people (!!!).

I think that you shouldn't block the request when cookie contains some control characters. It is completely legal and possible by scripts to save such character in the cookie - so you shouldn't block it.

I had to change the sources of lighttpd and compile it today because some versions of some browsers (ex. IE, Firefox) changed polish specific letter "?" into control character number 5. This character was saved in cookie and website was blocked for many many people. The same mechanism may be used by atackers.

The RFCs are pretty clear: CTL chars are not allowed. The current [draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-21#section-3.2) is also easy to read.

There is also a security aspect of this - allowing CTL chars might lead to new security issues.

So just stop tracking your users with google analytics, or tell google to fix it (or both). It might also be a good idea to tell browser vendors not to accept broken cookies.

Being compliant with specification is good but despite the specification there is also a normal life.
If saving special chars in cookies is possible and all browser allows for it lighttpd should handle such cookies.
There are some clever things that lighttpd may do. It may simply delete such chars or delete this one header containing this char etc.

But it is very bad idea to simply send "Bad Request" and ban a website for many many users. Maybe there should be some configuration directive telling what to do in such situation?

I checked other web servers and they accept cookies with special chars and there i no error.

Hahaha... I want to see when Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Apple, Opera etc. will listen to this advice.

We need to exploit it and then report critical security bug to Google, Mozilla etc. :)
Or add some option to lighttpd configuration to allow CTL chars in cookie values if we can't exploit it.

All this sites comes from the list of websites powered by lighty (<http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/PoweredByLighttpd>)

I think that owners of this websites wouldn't be happy if they have been banned for millions of visitors.

I tried some weeks ago and couldn't reproduce it with any of those links - perhaps analytics got fixed.
With JavaScript I still could set broken cookies (funny enough they don't like "\r" or "\n", so there seems to be some kind of check already).

-----//-----

Begin forwarded message:

From: Stefan Bühler <stbuehler@lighttpd.net>
To: oss-security@lists.openwall.com
Subject: [oss-security] browser document.cookie DoS vulnerability
Hi,
Chromium 25.0.1364.160 (debian testing), Iceweasel/Firefox 19 and
probably many other browsers allow javascript to set broken cookie
values, leading to possible permanent "400 Bad Request" responses. The
broken value might be set by 3rd party libraries.
For example the google analytics code is vulnerable, as it sets cookie
values based on parameters in the referer query string. lighttpd does
not allow control characters in http header values, so any lighttpd
site using google analytics is vulnerable if you can get the user to
follow a link (img tag for example) to that site like this:
<http://www.example.com/?utm_source=test&utm_medium=test&utm_campaign=te%05st>
Afaik apache doesn't check the cookie values (or perhaps removes the
broken characters). Imho they are responsible for this mess :)
To be clear: the bug is in the browser / javascript implementation:
document.cookie MUST NOT allow cookie values which include certain
control characters. Javascript applications should not use 8-bit
characters.
(If browser vendors want to allow broken cookie values to be stored,
they MUST NOT send them to the server; in this case javascript
applications can still read the broken values. But I don't think this
is a good idea.)
The safe character set for HTTP header values is: %x20-7E; %x80-FF is
obsoleted by the current draft.
"A recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before
interpreting the field value", so horizontal tabs are not "safe" - they
might get converted to a space, but are not forbidden (also multiple
spaces can get replaced by a single one).
I think this could use a CVE.
The problem was reported in our lighttpd bug tracker:
<http://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2188>
Kind regards,
Stefan
Testing the bug:
Try one of the listed urls in the ticket (the error should trigger
after a reload). If you have noscript, request policy, referer control
or similar stuff running you are probably safe; to test the bug in this
case you need a Javascript console on a lighttpd site

The "vulnerability" here is just a DOS attack, right? You can't actually go creating a well-formed request with arbitrary HTTP headers or anything like that?
This sounds like a sec-dos that we should just make public.
I suspect that throwing when a bad character was added via the DOM would be a compatibility nightmare, but could maybe try %-escaping the disallowed characters or something...Component: DOM → Networking: Cookies

I reproduced the bug loading a certain web page with the URL /?utm\_source=test&utm\_medium=test&utm\_campaign=te%05st to create the DOS cookie. Attempt to load any page on that domain fails from then on.
I wrote a fix that rejects the DOS cookies which contain control codes similar to the fix that chrome uses <http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/cookies/parsed_cookie.cc?r1=224268&r2=224267&pathrev=224268>

Yes, that choice was made purposefully (given breakage of tests indicating potential real-world breakage) if we also disable via document.cookie. Additionally, in testing, other browsers behaved the same way, so this has compatibility concerns, as well.Flags: needinfo?(hurley)

FYI, recently, Chrome patched this bug completely: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1174647#c9>

Also, Safari already doesn't store control characters in Cookie.

In modern browsers, only Firefox stores them via document.cookie and still has this DoS issue. I think it's time to re-open this issue.

The question here doesn't seem to make sense in this context.

The "browser document.cookie DoS" doesn't cause anything to crash. Our
Tuesday message in this thread was addressed to Murray McAllister, who
brought up the related issue of whether Firefox crashes should have
CVE assignments. That message of ours apparently contributed to the
mixup.

Very roughly, "browser document.cookie DoS" is a behavior, found in
multiple web browsers, that lets attackers perform the equivalent of a
Logout CSRF attack against many web sites.

In a "normal" Logout CSRF scenario, the browser sends a request to
(for example) /logout.php, and the web application interprets (or
"misinterprets") this to mean that the client user actually wishes to
be logged out. The web application might then change the state of
something on the server side to indicate that the user is logged out.

In this Logout CSRF variant, the browser doesn't send a request to
/logout.php and instead sends a request to someplace else, such as the
/ URI, with parameters to force a web application to set a malformed
cookie within the response. At the web-application layer, nothing
happens to log out the user. However, at the HTTP server level, the
user can be effectively logged out, because the HTTP server isn't
wiling to accept requests with malformed Cookie request headers.
What's even worse is that this is a Persistent Logout CSRF variant, in
the sense that the user cannot login again without restarting the web
browser.

(Yes, we realize that this isn't exactly like Logout CSRF, because the
behavior also prevents visiting unrestricted static pages, which
almost always would remain accessible after a "real" logout. Logout
CSRF just seemed to be the simplest model for describing the problem.)

It seems fairly clear that the web browsers can be blamed for the
problem, because they should not be sending the malformed Cookie
headers at all. When the web browser sends the malformed Cookie
header, it is (in effect) enabling a Logout CSRF vulnerability on a
web site that does not have any server-side Logout CSRF problem.

In addition, it would sometimes also be possible to blame code on the
server side, which should not be trying to set a malformed cookie. In
the case of Google Analytics, maybe the server-side issue is
site-specific on the *.google-analytics.com servers, and therefore
outside the scope of CVE.

One might also argue that an HTTP server (such as lighttpd) shouldn't
completely block access to the site upon seeing a malformed Cookie
header. That's not necessarily a vulnerability, though.

For now, it seems simplest to assign CVEs on this basis:

  - at least two independently implemented web browsers are capable of
    sending malformed Cookie headers that trigger the lighttpd
    request.c "invalid char in header" code, leading to the 400 HTTP
    status code

  - yes, it can be considered an interaction error between the browser
    and lighttpd

  - however, enough blame belongs to the browser that there should be
    one CVE assigned per independent browser implementation

Subject: browser document.cookie DoS vulnerability

Hi,

Chromium 25.0.1364.160 (debian testing), Iceweasel/Firefox 19 and
probably many other browsers allow javascript to set broken cookie
values, leading to possible permanent "400 Bad Request" responses. The
broken value might be set by 3rd party libraries.

For example the google analytics code is vulnerable, as it sets cookie
values based on parameters in the referer query string. lighttpd does
not allow control characters in http header values, so any lighttpd
site using google analytics is vulnerable if you can get the user to
follow a link (img tag for example) to that site like this:

<http://www.example.com/?utm_source=test&utm_medium=test&utm_campaign=te%05st>

Afaik apache doesn't check the cookie values (or perhaps removes the
broken characters). Imho they are responsible for this mess :)

To be clear: the bug is in the browser / javascript implementation:

document.cookie MUST NOT allow cookie values which include certain
control characters. Javascript applications should not use 8-bit
characters.

(If browser vendors want to allow broken cookie values to be stored,
they MUST NOT send them to the server; in this case javascript
applications can still read the broken values. But I don't think this
is a good idea.)

The safe character set for HTTP header values is: %x20-7E; %x80-FF is
obsoleted by the current draft.

"A recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before
interpreting the field value", so horizontal tabs are not "safe" - they
might get converted to a space, but are not forbidden (also multiple
spaces can get replaced by a single one).

I think this could use a CVE.

The problem was reported in our lighttpd bug tracker:
<http://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2188>

Kind regards,
Stefan

Testing the bug:

Try one of the listed urls in the ticket (the error should trigger
after a reload). If you have noscript, request policy, referer control
or similar stuff running you are probably safe; to test the bug in this
case you need a Javascript console on a lighttpd site
(<http://lighttpd.net> for example), and enter:

> document.cookie = "foo=bar\x05test"
Try to reload the page - it should return a 400 Bad Request page now.

> document.cookie = "foo="
And it should work again.

HTTP references:

<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616>
> message-header = field-name ":" [ field-value ]
> field-name     = token
> field-value    = *( field-content | LWS )
> field-content  = *TEXT | *(token | separators | quoted-string)
> LWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HTAB )
>
> # TEXT is superset of (token | separators | quoted-string)
> TEXT = LWS | %x21-7E | %x80-FF

<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-22>
> header-field   = field-name ":" OWS field-value BWS
> field-name     = token
> field-value    = *( field-content / obs-fold )
> field-content  = *( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / obs-text )
> obs-fold       = CRLF ( SP / HTAB )
>
> # obsolete text
> obs-text = %x80-FF

Basic definitions:
> # horizontal tab
> HTAB = %x09
> # space
> SP = %x20
> # visible ASCII
> VCHAR = %x21-7E
> # carriage return + line feed
> CRLF = %0x0D %0x0A

There didn't seem to be further discussion of this, and the public
vendor references don't yet have CVE IDs, so we are assigning these:

CVE-2013-6166 <https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=238041>
CVE-2013-6167 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=858215>
