Message-ID: <20131211154315.GB2348@openstack.org>
Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2013 15:43:15 +0000
From: Jeremy Stanley <jeremy@...nstack.org>

Subject: [OSSA 2013-032] Keystone trust circumvention through EC2-style
 tokens (CVE-2013-6391)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-032
CVE: CVE-2013-6391
Date: December 11, 2013
Title: Keystone trust circumvention through EC2-style tokens
Reporter: Steven Hardy (Red Hat)
Products: Keystone
Affects: Havana and later

Description:
Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Keystone
trusts when used in conjunction with the ec2tokens API. By
generating EC2 credentials using a trust-scoped token, a trustee may
retrieve a token not scoped to the trust, therefore elevating
privileges to all of the trustor's roles. Only Keystone setups
enabling EC2-style authentication are affected.

Icehouse (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/61419>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/61425>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the icehouse-2 development milestone
and in a future 2013.2.1 release.

### Bug Description

So I finally got around to investigating the scenario I mentioned in <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/40444/>, and unfortunately it seems that the ec2tokens API does indeed provide a way to circumvent the role delegation provided by trusts, and obtain all the roles of the trustor user, not just those explicitly delegated.

Steps to reproduce:

- Trustor creates a trust delegating a subset of roles

- Trustee gets a token scoped to that trust

- Trustee creates an ec2-keypair

- Trustee makes a request to the ec2tokens API, to validate a signature created with the keypair

- ec2tokens API returns a new token, which is not scoped to the trust and enables access to all the trustor's roles.

I can provide some test code which demonstrates the issue.

So, looking into this a bit more, it seems that we need to implement something similar to <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/40444/> to fix this.

Currently the token in the ec2 controller is generated with the user\_id and no knowledge of trusts. There are some issues with that patch atm though, looks like it still needs significant work.

Proposed fix attached - this currently has no tests, as there is no coverage at all of the Ec2Token controller, can I just propose adding the coverage via the normal gerrit process?

Also, this renders <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/40444/11> (and the related blueprint) obsolete, so we may want to warn the submitter of that patch not to bother doing any rework and resubmitting?

Update patch, one minor fix and added a test.

There are some limitations in what we can test atm, because the v2 token trust-scoping happens at the controller level (on an existing token) rather than when issuing it. This doesn't seem to enable a representative response to be generated (in terms of the token contents) due to the way the fixtures/mocking works in these tests.

I think probably what needs to happen (under a different bug) is the trust-scoping code needs to move from the controller to where the token is generated behind the identity\_api? (comments welcome on this..)

i.e this code is never hit in these tests, but it is when you make a real request:

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/token/controllers.py#L130>

So I guess that really needs to be happening here instead?

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/token/providers/uuid.py#L359>

Anyway, even with the somewhat limited test, this patch should fix the vulnerability and the test does provide coverage of the new code.

Note, I still need to test this with a MD5 hashed v3 token as I've only tested with pure v2 interfaces so far (other than the v3 call to create the trust). I'd like to ensure that creds\_ref still returns the trust\_id correctly in that case.

I tested with MD5 hashed v3 tokens, and all works OK, except for a client [bug #1244675](/bugs/1244675) which I've reported and have proposed a fix for. The API level behaviour is OK though, so I think this patch is OK to be proposed for merging, unless keystone folks have any review feedback (I've not had any comments at all so far)

TO explain the patch: the metadata on the frist token will havea trust\_id on it. When creating the EC2 Keyspair, this needs to be carried over. That is done by earlier code. What was missing is the call that appends the trust\_id on to the token created from the ec2 keypair. That is what is done at line 106. From this point forward, the trust\_id will be maintained.

In the future, we probably want to change from "if we can't find the trust id, assume that there is none." To an approach of "we need to see an avid disavowal of a trust\_id." Something like metadata.trust\_id = None. We need to ensure that we carry over proof of non-delegation from mechanism to mechanism or we are going to continue to have these forms of errors.

The patch as written looks good.

Mattieu, does you patch take any security issues into account that this one does not? It seems to be a larger patch, but I can't tell if that means it is covering a wider array of issues.

Ayoung: as far as I can tell this patch is more appropriate than mine regarding the problem at hand. What I was doing was serving the same trust token (ie the one used to create the ec2 creds) whenever there was an ec2 authentication. This wasn't a good idea, due to the short lifespan of tokens.

I also added a reference to the trustee id when creating the credentials, so that it'd be possible to differenciate impersonation.

Description:

Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Keystone trusts when used in conjunction with the ec2tokens API. By generating EC2 tokens from a trust-scoped token, a trustee may retrieve a token not scoped to the trust, therefore elevtaing privileges to all of the trustor's roles. Only Keystone setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected.

The impact description looks good to me (#20).

This patchset only seems to apply (#6) to stable/havana. For use in stable/havana +2 for me.

We will need slightly different patchsets for grizzly and master as there was enough shuffling in havana to move code around fairly significantly. Master has now seen some changes that eliminate the identity\_api -> assignment\_api proxy that this patchset relies on.

I'll work on posting the "fixed" patchsets for grizzly and master today to this thread.

For Grizzly, there is no good way to correlate (as far as I can tell) the Trust to the EC2 Credential. EC2 Credential was refactored in Havana to have a lot more information available to it (generic credentials backend that is not limited to the very limited EC2 data set).

The easiest solution is to either

1: Disable EC2 credentials for trust scoped tokens

2: State that it is recommended that trusts and EC2 contrib not be enabled at the same time.

I am not sure what the alternatives for getting more data into the EC2 credential would be in the Grizzly code base. It might be possible to add a migration to grizzly that encompasses the new data and the first migration of Havana for the DB. I think that a new migration is a sub-optimal choice.

@Morgan Fainberg - my vote is for (1), since there may be users of both trusts and ec2tokens on grizzly (who won't want this hole to be exploitable), but they probably don't care about ec2 credentials derived from a trust (well they can't because it doesn't currently work..)

AFAIK Heat is the only thing which wants to make use of ec2 credentials derived from a trust ID, which will be possible after this is fixed, and we only care about that functionality from Havana onwards, so (1) wfm and shouldn't impact existing users (whereas the second option will, potentially)

@Morgan: go for (1)

I should probably add a grizzly-specific note explaining that we took this radical action in the patch.

Something like "Note: the patch for this vulnerability in Grizzly disables the ability to derive ec2 credentials from a trust, as there is no clean way in Grizzly to properly correlate the two." -- Feel free to suggest better wording to add to the description.

Ok a couple bits of added information.

Grizzly is not affected by this bug to an issue with how impersonation is checked for. As seen here: <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/keystone/tree/keystone/token/controllers.py?h=stable/grizzly#n204>

we check for the string "True" not the singleton True. This means that impersonation will never work within grizzly and mitigates this problem. This issue was fixed in Havana but never backported.

I have not finalized testing in this grizzly patchset, I will work on finalizing tests once I am back at home this evening. This fix can be validated by using Steven Hardy's script from #1. I have confirmed this re-enables Impersonation Trusts and fixes the security flaw.

Fix issues handling trust tokens via ec2tokens API

Trust scoped tokens are handled incorectly when making requests

    via the ec2tokens API, meaning that the restrictions enforced

    by trust-scoped tokens are not respected when obtaining a token

    via ec2token signature validation.

Storing the trust\_id in the blob associated with the ec2 keypair,

    and passing that id in the metadata when requesting a v2 token

    solves the issue.

Are you using the system installed keystoneclient rather than a venv? If so what version?

I'm hitting the same as Jamie trying to prepare Ubuntu package builds of the stable/havana 2013.2.1 release. Neither of us are using venv, we're attempting to build system packages using distro provided dependencies. In this case, we're using the python-keystoneclient package version 0.3.2-0ubuntu1, which should satisfy keystones requirement (python-keystoneclient>=0.3.2).

I know that this fix was blocked from merging into stable/havana until a corresponding update to global requirements got merged. The requirements update for keystone is @ <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/61534/>. However, its difficult to know what changes to the requirements are relevant to this fix and what changes came in as part of the general sync.

Any hints appreciated.

Did a bit more digging... Steven's right, looks like an issue using older version of keystoneclient. With <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/48462/> applied against our 0.3.2 package, tests run again. The patch didn't release with keystoneclient until 0.4.1

@Steven

Is the keystones requirements' "python-keystoneclient>=0.3.2" entry correct, or does it need to be updated to >=0.4.1? In other words, is this just an issue for the test suite or is keystone still vulnerable if using an older client library?

Thanks,

Adam

I confirm it was a limitation of python-keystoneclient 0.3.2. If I upgrade to 0.4.1 the test passes.

Fix v2 token user ref with trust impersonation=True

The v2 token controller incorrectly checks for a string instead

    of a boolean, which results in the wrong user ID (trustee, when

    it should be the trustor) when impersonation=True. So fix the

    comparison and tests, adding a test which illustrates the issue.

This patchset also closes the gap that allows EC2 credentials to

    be issued from trust-scoped tokens, allowing privilege escalation

    since EC2 tokens have no concept of trust-scoping/role

    restrictions in the Grizzly release.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2061-1: OpenStack Keystone vulnerability

19 December 2013

Keystone access controls could be circumvented via EC2-style tokens.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [keystone](/security/cves?package=keystone) - OpenStack identity service

## Details

Steven Hardy discovered that Keystone did not properly enforce trusts when

using the ec2tokens API. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to

retrieve a token not scoped to the trust and elevate privileges to the

trustor's roles.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [python-keystone](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone)
  -
  [1:2013.2-0ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone/1%3A2013.2-0ubuntu1.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1039164#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-12-06 19:44:10 UTC  ``` Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack	Project	reports:  Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Keystone trusts when used in conjunction with the ec2tokens API. By generating EC2 credentials using a trust-scoped token, a trustee may retrieve a token not scoped to the trust, therefore elevating privileges to all of the trustor's roles. Only Keystone setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1039164#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-12-06 19:48:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 833742](attachment.cgi?id=833742&action=diff "cve-2013-6391-master-icehouse.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=833742&action=edit "cve-2013-6391-master-icehouse.patch") cve-2013-6391-master-icehouse.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1039164#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-12-06 19:49:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 833743](attachment.cgi?id=833743&action=diff "cve-2013-6391-stable-havana.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=833743&action=edit "cve-2013-6391-stable-havana.patch") cve-2013-6391-stable-havana.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1039164#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2013-12-06 21:53:53 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:   Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue.

# RHSA-2014:0089 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-keystone security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0089)

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The openstack-keystone packages provide keystone, a Python implementation
of the OpenStack Identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
Catalog, and Policy services.

It was found that the ec2token API in keystone, which is used to generate
EC2-style (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) credentials, could generate a
token not scoped to a particular trust when creating a token from a
received trust-scoped token. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
retrieve a token that elevated their privileges to all of the trustor's
roles. Note that only OpenStack Identity setups that have EC2-style
authentication enabled were affected. (CVE-2013-6391)

Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for
reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Steven Hardy of Red Hat as the
original reporter.

These updated packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2013.2.1,
which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1045408)

All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

So I finally got around to investigating the scenario I mentioned in <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/40444/>, and unfortunately it seems that the ec2tokens API does indeed provide a way to circumvent the role delegation provided by trusts, and obtain all the roles of the trustor user, not just those explicitly delegated.

Steps to reproduce:

- Trustor creates a trust delegating a subset of roles

- Trustee gets a token scoped to that trust

- Trustee creates an ec2-keypair

- Trustee makes a request to the ec2tokens API, to validate a signature created with the keypair

- ec2tokens API returns a new token, which is not scoped to the trust and enables access to all the trustor's roles.

I can provide some test code which demonstrates the issue.

So, looking into this a bit more, it seems that we need to implement something similar to <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/40444/> to fix this.

Currently the token in the ec2 controller is generated with the user\_id and no knowledge of trusts. There are some issues with that patch atm though, looks like it still needs significant work.

Proposed fix attached - this currently has no tests, as there is no coverage at all of the Ec2Token controller, can I just propose adding the coverage via the normal gerrit process?

Also, this renders <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/40444/11> (and the related blueprint) obsolete, so we may want to warn the submitter of that patch not to bother doing any rework and resubmitting?

Update patch, one minor fix and added a test.

There are some limitations in what we can test atm, because the v2 token trust-scoping happens at the controller level (on an existing token) rather than when issuing it. This doesn't seem to enable a representative response to be generated (in terms of the token contents) due to the way the fixtures/mocking works in these tests.

I think probably what needs to happen (under a different bug) is the trust-scoping code needs to move from the controller to where the token is generated behind the identity\_api? (comments welcome on this..)

i.e this code is never hit in these tests, but it is when you make a real request:

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/token/controllers.py#L130>

So I guess that really needs to be happening here instead?

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/keystone/token/providers/uuid.py#L359>

Anyway, even with the somewhat limited test, this patch should fix the vulnerability and the test does provide coverage of the new code.

Note, I still need to test this with a MD5 hashed v3 token as I've only tested with pure v2 interfaces so far (other than the v3 call to create the trust). I'd like to ensure that creds\_ref still returns the trust\_id correctly in that case.

I tested with MD5 hashed v3 tokens, and all works OK, except for a client [bug #1244675](/bugs/1244675) which I've reported and have proposed a fix for. The API level behaviour is OK though, so I think this patch is OK to be proposed for merging, unless keystone folks have any review feedback (I've not had any comments at all so far)

TO explain the patch: the metadata on the frist token will havea trust\_id on it. When creating the EC2 Keyspair, this needs to be carried over. That is done by earlier code. What was missing is the call that appends the trust\_id on to the token created from the ec2 keypair. That is what is done at line 106. From this point forward, the trust\_id will be maintained.

In the future, we probably want to change from "if we can't find the trust id, assume that there is none." To an approach of "we need to see an avid disavowal of a trust\_id." Something like metadata.trust\_id = None. We need to ensure that we carry over proof of non-delegation from mechanism to mechanism or we are going to continue to have these forms of errors.

The patch as written looks good.

Mattieu, does you patch take any security issues into account that this one does not? It seems to be a larger patch, but I can't tell if that means it is covering a wider array of issues.

Ayoung: as far as I can tell this patch is more appropriate than mine regarding the problem at hand. What I was doing was serving the same trust token (ie the one used to create the ec2 creds) whenever there was an ec2 authentication. This wasn't a good idea, due to the short lifespan of tokens.

I also added a reference to the trustee id when creating the credentials, so that it'd be possible to differenciate impersonation.

Proposed impact description, please doublecheck that I got it right (included affected versions):

-------------------------------------------

Title: Keystone trust circumvention through EC2-style tokens

Reporter: Steven Hardy (Red Hat)

Products: Keystone

Affects: Grizzly and later

Description:

Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Keystone trusts when used in conjunction with the ec2tokens API. By generating EC2 tokens from a trust-scoped token, a trustee may retrieve a token not scoped to the trust, therefore elevtaing privileges to all of the trustor's roles. Only Keystone setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected.

The impact description looks good to me (#20).

This patchset only seems to apply (#6) to stable/havana. For use in stable/havana +2 for me.

We will need slightly different patchsets for grizzly and master as there was enough shuffling in havana to move code around fairly significantly. Master has now seen some changes that eliminate the identity\_api -> assignment\_api proxy that this patchset relies on.

I'll work on posting the "fixed" patchsets for grizzly and master today to this thread.

For Grizzly, there is no good way to correlate (as far as I can tell) the Trust to the EC2 Credential. EC2 Credential was refactored in Havana to have a lot more information available to it (generic credentials backend that is not limited to the very limited EC2 data set).

The easiest solution is to either

1: Disable EC2 credentials for trust scoped tokens

2: State that it is recommended that trusts and EC2 contrib not be enabled at the same time.

I am not sure what the alternatives for getting more data into the EC2 credential would be in the Grizzly code base. It might be possible to add a migration to grizzly that encompasses the new data and the first migration of Havana for the DB. I think that a new migration is a sub-optimal choice.

@Morgan Fainberg - my vote is for (1), since there may be users of both trusts and ec2tokens on grizzly (who won't want this hole to be exploitable), but they probably don't care about ec2 credentials derived from a trust (well they can't because it doesn't currently work..)

AFAIK Heat is the only thing which wants to make use of ec2 credentials derived from a trust ID, which will be possible after this is fixed, and we only care about that functionality from Havana onwards, so (1) wfm and shouldn't impact existing users (whereas the second option will, potentially)

@Morgan: go for (1)

I should probably add a grizzly-specific note explaining that we took this radical action in the patch.

Something like "Note: the patch for this vulnerability in Grizzly disables the ability to derive ec2 credentials from a trust, as there is no clean way in Grizzly to properly correlate the two." -- Feel free to suggest better wording to add to the description.

@Thierry,

Sounds good. I'll get going on that change for grizzly. Hopefully have the patchset in order today.

* [0001-Fix-issues-handling-trust-tokens-via-ec2tokens-API-grizzly.patch](https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/%2Bbug/1242597/%2Battachment/3914454/%2Bfiles/0001-Fix-issues-handling-trust-tokens-via-ec2tokens-API-grizzly.patch)
  [Edit](/keystone/%2Bbug/1242597/%2Battachment/3914454)
  (2.9 KiB,
  text/plain)

Ok a couple bits of added information.

Grizzly is not affected by this bug to an issue with how impersonation is checked for. As seen here: <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/keystone/tree/keystone/token/controllers.py?h=stable/grizzly#n204>

we check for the string "True" not the singleton True. This means that impersonation will never work within grizzly and mitigates this problem. This issue was fixed in Havana but never backported.

I have not finalized testing in this grizzly patchset, I will work on finalizing tests once I am back at home this evening. This fix can be validated by using Steven Hardy's script from #1. I have confirmed this re-enables Impersonation Trusts and fixes the security flaw.

In theory the patchset in #29 can go through public gerrit after the Havana / master patchset go through if desired.

OK, amending description based on that info, please reconfirm:

-------------------------------------------

Title: Keystone trust circumvention through EC2-style tokens

Reporter: Steven Hardy (Red Hat)

Products: Keystone

Affects: Havana and later

Description:

Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Keystone trusts when used in conjunction with the ec2tokens API. By generating EC2 credentials using a trust-scoped token, a trustee may retrieve a token not scoped to the trust, therefore elevating privileges to all of the trustor's roles. Only Keystone setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected.

---------------------------------------------

(Yes, we can push the grizzly fix publicly once this is opened)

Can anyone provide a status update on this - will the fix be landing in Icehouse-1?

The heat instance-users work (related to [bug #1089261](/bugs/1089261)) has been blocked since this was reported, so I'm really hoping we can get the fix in soon.. :)

Fix issues handling trust tokens via ec2tokens API

Trust scoped tokens are handled incorectly when making requests

    via the ec2tokens API, meaning that the restrictions enforced

    by trust-scoped tokens are not respected when obtaining a token

    via ec2token signature validation.

Storing the trust\_id in the blob associated with the ec2 keypair,

    and passing that id in the metadata when requesting a v2 token

    solves the issue.

Are you using the system installed keystoneclient rather than a venv? If so what version?

I'm hitting the same as Jamie trying to prepare Ubuntu package builds of the stable/havana 2013.2.1 release. Neither of us are using venv, we're attempting to build system packages using distro provided dependencies. In this case, we're using the python-keystoneclient package version 0.3.2-0ubuntu1, which should satisfy keystones requirement (python-keystoneclient>=0.3.2).

I know that this fix was blocked from merging into stable/havana until a corresponding update to global requirements got merged. The requirements update for keystone is @ <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/61534/>. However, its difficult to know what changes to the requirements are relevant to this fix and what changes came in as part of the general sync.

Any hints appreciated.

Did a bit more digging... Steven's right, looks like an issue using older version of keystoneclient. With <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/48462/> applied against our 0.3.2 package, tests run again. The patch didn't release with keystoneclient until 0.4.1

@Steven

Is the keystones requirements' "python-keystoneclient>=0.3.2" entry correct, or does it need to be updated to >=0.4.1? In other words, is this just an issue for the test suite or is keystone still vulnerable if using an older client library?

Thanks,

Adam

I confirm it was a limitation of python-keystoneclient 0.3.2. If I upgrade to 0.4.1 the test passes.

commit 8fcc18c42bde2db34e4b29236dc2e971d40f146b

Author: Steven Hardy <email address hidden>

Date: Sun Oct 13 10:44:52 2013 +0100

Fix v2 token user ref with trust impersonation=True

The v2 token controller incorrectly checks for a string instead

    of a boolean, which results in the wrong user ID (trustee, when

    it should be the trustor) when impersonation=True. So fix the

    comparison and tests, adding a test which illustrates the issue.

This patchset also closes the gap that allows EC2 credentials to

    be issued from trust-scoped tokens, allowing privilege escalation

    since EC2 tokens have no concept of trust-scoping/role

    restrictions in the Grizzly release.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
