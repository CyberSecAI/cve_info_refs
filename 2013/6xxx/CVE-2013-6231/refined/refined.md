- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Input manipulation. The vulnerability is triggered when the `AdapterHTTP?ACTION_NAME=MANAGE_USER_ACTION` servlet is executed with specifically crafted input, allowing modification of user roles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation due to improper input validation when modifying user roles through the `MANAGE_USER_ACTION` servlet.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, authenticated attacker can elevate their privileges to administrator level, gaining full control over the affected system and access to all data.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack is performed by sending a malicious request to the `AdapterHTTP?ACTION_NAME=MANAGE_USER_ACTION` servlet. An attacker with a restricted account can use this to grant themselves administrator privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid, though restricted, account in SpagoBI (e.g. Business User with RSM role). They also need network access to the vulnerable SpagoBI instance.
