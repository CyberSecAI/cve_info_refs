- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in an ActiveX control within IBM SPSS SamplePower that handles the "drop-down" list capability when editing a cell value. The specific weakness is not detailed, but the vulnerability lies in how the control gets or sets the data for this dropdown functionality
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A remote code execution vulnerability in the ActiveX control's ComboList property.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's system by exploiting the vulnerability in the ActiveX control.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector would likely involve crafting a malicious web page or document that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control in IBM SPSS SamplePower.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to entice a user to open a malicious web page or file containing the exploit. The user must also have the vulnerable version of IBM SPSS SamplePower installed.
