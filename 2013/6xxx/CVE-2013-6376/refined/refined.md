{
  "cveId": "CVE-2013-6376",
  "description": "The recalculate_apic_map function in arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.12.5 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a crafted ICR write operation in x2apic mode.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the `recalculate_apic_map` function within the KVM subsystem. This function does not properly validate the cluster ID when handling Inter-Processor Interrupt (IPI) requests in x2apic mode. The code uses the high 16 bits of the ICR2 register, which is controlled by the guest, as the cluster ID. KVM only supports cluster ID 0, but this check is missing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of the cluster ID from the ICR2 register, leading to out-of-bounds access."
    ],
    "impact": "A guest user can cause a denial of service on the host system (host OS crash).",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A privileged guest user can trigger the vulnerability by writing specific values to the ICR register to request an IPI while in x2apic mode."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be a privileged guest user within a KVM virtual machine."
  }
