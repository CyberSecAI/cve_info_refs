Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in MediaWiki's SVG upload processing. The system did not properly validate if the uploaded SVG file was well-formed XML. If the XML parser failed to parse the SVG due to invalid XML, the subsequent script checks were skipped, allowing malicious SVG files with embedded scripts to bypass the sanitization process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient XML Validation:** The core weakness was the lack of a mandatory well-formedness check for uploaded SVG files.
- **Bypass of Script Checks:** By uploading malformed XML, attackers could bypass the `checkSvgScriptCallback`, which was designed to detect and block embedded scripts within SVG files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation could lead to XSS attacks. An attacker could upload a crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript that would execute when a user views the image.
- **Account Hijacking:** This vulnerability could potentially lead to account hijacking if the attacker's JavaScript gained access to user sessions or performed malicious actions on the user's behalf.
- **Spam Delivery:** An attacker could also use the injected script to deliver spam anonymously, as mentioned in the original report.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SVG File Upload:** The primary attack vector was the upload of a specially crafted SVG file containing malformed XML along with a malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needed the ability to upload files to the MediaWiki instance. This is typically possible for authenticated users with the required permissions.
- **Crafting Malicious SVG:** The attacker needed the knowledge to craft a malformed XML SVG file that includes executable JavaScript.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was identified during an internal review of MediaWiki's SVG sanitization process.
- The fix involves explicitly rejecting SVG files during upload if the XML parser reports that the file is not well-formed, effectively preventing the bypass of the script checks.

- A related issue (mentioned by tstarling) is that the xml_parse() function could also return false due to resource limits during parsing, which also bypasses the check. The fix handles this as well.

- Patches were created and applied to MediaWiki versions 1.19, 1.21, and 1.22 to address this issue.
