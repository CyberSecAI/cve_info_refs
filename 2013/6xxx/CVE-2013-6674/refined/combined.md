| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric

Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen and Sotaro Ikeda

discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. If a user

had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential data or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Fredrik Lönnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Thunderbird. If a user

had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Thunderbird. If a user had

enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to steal confidential information.

([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

Fabián Cuchietti and Ateeq ur Rehman Khan discovered that it was possible

to bypass Javascript execution restrictions when replying to or forwarding

mail messages in certain circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to steal confidential information or modify message content.

([CVE-2013-6674](/security/CVE-2013-6674))

Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Thunderbird is a free, open-source, cross-platform application for managing email and news feeds. It is a
local (rather than a web-based) email application that is powerful yet easy-to-use. Thunderbird has lots of cool
features.
Thunderbird gives you control and ownership over your email. There are lots of add-ons available for Thunderbird that
enable you to extend and customize your email experience. Thunderbird is part of the Mozilla Manifesto, a pledge that
describes Mozilla`s commitment to an open, accessible, egalitarian Internet.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published

Affected Product(s):
====================
Mozilla
Product: Thunderbird - EMail Application 17.0.6

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote

Severity Level:
===============
High

Technical Details & Description:
================================
It has been discovered that the security controls / filters currently being used in Mozilla Thunderbird application can
be easily
evaded if an attacker decides to encrypt the payloads with base64 encryption and combine it with the <object> tag.
During the testing,
it was initially noticed that malicious javascript tags were being filtered / blocked in the Thunderbird application
however, Attaching
a debugger with the Thunderbird .exe file revealed some very interesting information and gave much better insight
behind the actual
working of the application. Most of the information revealed is Javascript errors which gave the researcher much hope
in believing that
the application might actually be vulnerable.

By default, HTML tags like <script> and <iframe> are blocked in Thunderbird and get filtered immediately upon insertion
however,
While drafting a new email message, attackers can easily bypass the current input filters by encoding their payloads
with base64 encryption and using the <object> tag and insert malicious scripts / code eg. (script / frame) within the
emails
and send it to the victims. The exploit gets triggered once the victim decides to reply back and clicks on the `Reply`
or `Forward` Buttons.

After successfully bypassing the input filters, an attacker can inject persistent script code while writing a new email
and send it to victims.
Interestingly the payload gets filtered during the initial viewing mode however if the victim clicks on Reply or
Forward, the exploit gets executed
successfully. For a POC i will be including multiple examples in this advisory for your review. I was able to run
multiple scripts generating strange
behaviour on the application which can be seen in the debugging errors which I have attached along with this report.

These sort of vulnerabilities can result in multiple attack vectors on the client end which may eventually result in
complete
compromise of the end user system. The persistent code injection vulnerability is located within the main application.

Exploitation of this persistent application vulnerability requires a low or medium user interaction. Successful
exploitation of
the vulnerability may result in malicious script code being executed in the victims browser resulting in script code
injection,
persistent phishing, Client side redirects and similar client side attacks.

Vulnerable Service(s):
                        [+] Mozilla Thunderbird 17.0.6 - Latest Release

Vulnerable Section(s):
                        [+] Write (Create a new message)
                        [+] Email Signature (Account Settings)
                        [+] Attach File with Signature as HTML (Account Settings)

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The filter bypass & persistent script code inject web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without
privileged user account
or direct user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided steps and
information below.

Proof of Concept #1

a) Create a new email message
b) In the body text, insert new HTML tag with the POC "Payload"
c) Send the email to the victim
d) Open the new email in the victim browser and click Reply
e) You should now see a Javascript Application popup window proving the existence of this vulnerability.

Proof of Concept #2

a) Goto Tools and then Account Settings
b) Under the Signature Text, insert the Payload and enable 'Use HTML'
c) Close the menu and Click on "Write" to create a new email
d) You should get a popup the moment new Email editor window opens up proving the existence of this vulnerability.

Proof of Concept #3

a) Create a new text file on your desktop (local computer) and insert the POC payload in it and save it as test.html
(HTML)
b) Goto Tools and then Account Settings
c) Below the Signature Text box, enable 'Attach the signature from a file instead'
d) Click Choose and select the 'test.html' file which you created in step a.
e) Click on Write and you should be able to see the Javascript popup proving the existence of this vulnerability.

Payload #1

<object data="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiTW96aWxsYS1UaHVuZGVyYmlyZC1TY3JpcHQtQ29kZS1JbmplY3Rpb24t
UE9DLUF0ZWVxLUtoYW4iKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=
"></object>

Payload #2

<EMBED SRC="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxuczpzdmc9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDov

1.3

POC Technical Description:

Here, we used the data URI payload as a value assigned to the ‘data’ attribute of the ‘object’ tag. The <object> tag is
used to include objects
such as images, audio, videos, Java applets, ActiveX, PDF, and Flash. The ‘data’ attribute of the object tag defines a
URL that refers to the
object’s data. Data in the "data:" URI is encoded as a base64 string:

Base64-encoded payload:
PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiTW96aWxsYS1UaHVuZGVyYmlyZC1TY3JpcHQtQ29kZS1JbmplY3Rpb24tUE9DLUF0ZWVxLUtoYW4iKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=

Base64-decoded payload: <script>alert("Mozilla-Thunderbird-Script-Code-Injection-POC-Ateeq-Khan");</script>

When the browser loads the object tag, it loads an object (in our case, it’s a javascript) assigned to its data
attribute. This causes execution
of our javascript. We were able to bypass the application blacklist filter because of the base64-encoded payload.

## Mozilla Thunderbird does not adequately restrict HTML elements in email message content

#### Vulnerability Note VU#863369

Original Release Date: 2014-01-27 | Last Revised: 2014-01-28

---

### Overview

Mozilla Thunderbird does not adequately restrict HTML elements in email content, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script when a specially-crafted email message is forwarded or replied to.

### Description

| Vulnerability Lab has reported a vulnerability in the way Mozilla Thunderbird handles HTML elements in email content. Mozilla Thunderbird blocks the creation of certain HTML elements, such as script, when displaying email messages. Traditionally, a script element is created through the use of a <script> HTML tag. HTML elements, including script, can also be created through the use of an <object> tag that specifies a [Data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/data_URIs) scheme ([RFC 2397](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397)). The Data URI can specify a text/html mime type and encode the script in base64. In such cases, Thunderbird will execute the script contained in the email message when it is forwarded or replied to and the outgoing message is in HTML format. Simply displaying the email message does not appear to cause the script to execute.  See [Mozilla Bug Bounty #5 - WireTap Remote Web Vulnerability](http://www.vulnerability-lab.com/get_content.php?id=953) for more details.Testing indicates that Thunderbird 17.0.{6,7,8} are vulnerable. Earlier versions may also be vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By creating a specially-crafted email message, an attacker can cause arbitrary script to execute in Thunderbird when that message is forwarded or replied to. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Limited testing has shown that Thunderbird versions 24.0 and later are not affected by this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| **Compose email in plain text format**Disabling the setting to "Compose messages in HTML format" for each email account will help protect against attacks. This will cause outgoing messages to be constructed in plain text, which does not contain HTML elements. |

I've just done a bit of testing. This seems to affect Thunderbird 22 and older. 23 and 24 are unaffected. At the moment, I suspect there's probably been some core change, but I'll need to dig into it.
With a bit more testing, this doesn't affect reading email, but there is an attack vector if the sender can get the receiver to respond or forward the email. I think sec-moderate is about right here.

The original symptoms aren't quite up to security bug bounty level, but it did prompt us to investigate and discover the somewhat worse symptoms Mark described in [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=868267#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - HTML mail compose self-XSS due to signature text"). Awarding a split bounty for this one.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-14

## Script execution in HTML mail replies

Announced
February 6, 2014
Reporter
Fabián Cuchietti, Ateeq ur Rehman Khan
Impact
High
Products
SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* SeaMonkey 2.20
* Thunderbird 23

### Description

Security researcher **Fabián Cuchietti** discovered that
it was possible to bypass the restriction on JavaScript execution in mail by
embedding an <iframe> with a data: URL within a message. If the victim
replied or forwarded the mail after receiving it, quoting it "in-line"
using Thunderbird's HTML mail editor, it would run the attached script. The
running script would be restricted to the mail composition window where it could
observe and potentially modify the content of the mail before it was sent.
Scripts were not executed if the recipient merely viewed the mail, only if it
was edited as HTML. Turning off HTML composition prevented the vulnerability and
forwarding the mail "as attachment" prevented the forwarding
variant.

**Ateeq ur Rehman Khan** of Vulnerability Labs reported
additional variants of this attack involving the use of the <object> tag
and which could be used to attach object data types such as images, audio, or
video.

This affected the Thunderbird 17 branch. It was fixed in all
versions based on Gecko 23 or later. Thunderbird 24 and later are not affected
by this vulnerability.

Introduction:
=============
Thunderbird is a free, open-source, cross-platform application for managing email and news feeds. It is a local (rather than a web-based) email application that is powerful yet easy-to-use. Thunderbird has lots of cool features. Thunderbird gives you control and ownership over your email. There are lots of add-ons available for Thunderbird that enable you to extend and customize your email experience. Thunderbird is part of the Mozilla Manifesto, a pledge that describes Mozilla`s commitment to an open, accessible, egalitarian Internet.

Severity:
=========
Medium
Details:
========
It has been discovered that the security controls / filters currently being used in Mozilla Thunderbird application can be easily evaded if an attacker decides to encrypt the payloads with base64 encryption and combine it with the <object> tag. During the testing, it was initially noticed that malicious javascript tags were being filtered / blocked in the Thunderbird application however, Attaching a debugger with the Thunderbird .exe file revealed some very interesting information and gave much better insight behind the actual working of the application. Most of the information revealed is Javascript errors which gave the researcher much hope in believing that the application might actually be vulnerable.
By default, HTML tags like <script> and <iframe> are blocked in Thunderbird and get filtered immediately upon insertion however, While drafting a new email message, attackers can easily bypass the current input filters by encoding their payloads with base64 encryption and using the <object> tag and insert malicious scripts / code eg. (script / frame) within the emails and send it to the victims. The exploit gets triggered once the victim decides to reply back and clicks on the \'Reply\' or \'Forward\' Buttons.
After successfully bypassing the input filters, an attacker can inject persistent script code while writing a new email and send it to victims. Interestingly the payload gets filtered during the initial viewing mode however if the victim clicks on Reply or Forward, the exploit gets executed successfully. For a POC i will be including multiple examples in this advisory for your review. I was able to run multiple scripts generating strange behaviour on the application which can be seen in the debugging errors which I have attached along with this report.
These sort of vulnerabilities can result in multiple attack vectors on the client end which may eventually result in complete compromise of the end user system. The persistent code injection vulnerability is located within the main application.
Exploitation of this persistent application vulnerability requires a low or medium user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in malicious script code being executed in the victims browser resulting in script code injection, persistent phishing, Client side redirects and similar client side attacks.
Vulnerable Service(s):
[+] Mozilla Thunderbird 17.0.6 - Latest Release
Vulnerable Section(s):
[+] Write (Create a new message)
[+] Email Signature (Account Settings)
[+] Attach File with Signature as HTML (Account Settings)
Proof of Concept:
=================
For successful exploitation of this bug, the attacker needs follow the following steps:
a) Create a new email message
b) In the body text, insert new HTML tag with the POC "Payload"
c) Send the email to the victim
d) Open the new email in the victim browser and click Reply
e) You should now see a Javascript Application popup window proving the existence of this vulnerability.
Proof of Concept #2
-------------------
a) Goto Tools and then Account Settings
b) Under the Signature Text, insert the Payload and enable 'Use HTML'
c) Close the menu and Click on "Write" to create a new email
d) You should get a popup the moment new Email editor window opens up proving the existence of this vulnerability.
Proof of Concept #3
-------------------
a) Create a new text file on your desktop (local computer) and insert the POC payload in it and save it as test.html (HTML)
b) Goto Tools and then Account Settings
c) Below the Signature Text box, enable 'Attach the signature from a file instead'
d) Click Choose and select the 'test.html' file which you created in step a.
e) Click on Write and you should be able to see the Javascript popup proving the existence of this vulnerability.

1.3
POC Technical Description:
--------------------------
Here, we used the data URI payload as a value assigned to the ëdataí attribute of the ëobjectí tag. The <object> tag is used to include objects such as images, audio, videos, Java applets, ActiveX, PDF, and Flash. The ëdataí attribute of the object tag defines a URL that refers to the object's data. Data in the "data:" URI is encoded as a base64 string:
Base64-encoded payload: PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiTW96aWxsYS1UaHVuZGVyYmlyZC1TY3JpcHQtQ29kZS1JbmplY3Rpb24tUE9DLUF0ZWVxLUtoYW4iKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=
Base64-decoded payload: <script>alert("Mozilla-Thunderbird-Script-Code-Injection-POC-Ateeq-Khan");</script>
When the browser loads the object tag, it loads an object (in our case, itís a javascript) assigned to its data attribute. This causes execution of our javascript. We were able to bypass the application blacklist filter because of the base64-encoded payload.

This is a duplicate of [bug 868267](/show_bug.cgi?id=868267 "RESOLVED FIXED - HTML mail compose self-XSS due to signature text"), there's a few more test cases, but really they are all the same result.
I guess my only concern would be to ensure we've covered the svg case when we fix that bug.

I don't know what the bug summary means so I'm changing it. Where does Base URI come into this anywhere?
(In reply to Al Billings [:abillings] from [comment #5](/show_bug.cgi?id=875818#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - HTML compose window XSS via <object> tag on Reply/Forward (\"wiretap\" is back)"))
> Can we dupe this or otherwise make a dependency since this is an open
> security issue?
There are multiple issues described in this bug which means potentially multiple resolutions. That obviously can't be handled in a single bug so maybe we need to treat this as a tracker bug and split out bugs for each separate issue.
[bug 868267](/show_bug.cgi?id=868267 "RESOLVED FIXED - HTML mail compose self-XSS due to signature text") is strictly about self-XSS due to the signature text. That seems to match Poc2 and Poc3.
That misses the main claim of this bug that if you send this mail to a victim "if the victim clicks on Reply or Forward, the exploit gets executed successfully." PoC #1 makes no mention of the signature file and it's a different, more serious, bug. This means the old "wiretap" flaws have come back like [bug 66938](/show_bug.cgi?id=66938 "VERIFIED FIXED - Eavesdropping on mail messages using innerHTML (wiretap)") etc.
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=FIX+wiretap>
I have tested this and the claim is accurate.
Important caveat: the victim must be using HTML compose. This is the default so not a hard condition in a real attack, but I know plain text is popular with engineers and you'll miss this bug if you test with plain-text compose windows.
In the "Forward" case the victim must forward "in-line", it does not work if you forward "as attachment". The former (vulnerable) setting is also the default.
The reporter's guess about base64 escaping filtering appears inaccurate, changing payload 1 to
<object data="data:text/html,<script>alert(1)</script>"></object>
seems to work just as well. In addition to <object> and <embed> we also have this problem with
<iframe src="data:text/html,<script>alert(1)</script>"><iframe>
I thought we disabled Javascript at the docshell level so I don't understand how this could work. Or maybe we do on the viewing pane (which is why scripts don't run there) but can't in an editor? If we're truly relying on filtering I bet there's a lot more problems here.Summary: Base URI Filter Bypass & Persistent Script Code Injection Vulnerability → HTML compose window XSS via <object> tag on Reply/Forward ("wiretap" is back)

First question: which Gecko version are we talking about here? There were recent m-c changes to disabling JS in designMode documents (to NOT disable it) that might perhaps be relevant... But the report is against Gecko 17, right?

I confirmed this in a release Thunderbird, so yes, that's Gecko 17.
Raising the severity because it could affect any Thunderbird recipient with default settings. All the attacker needs is to write something inflammatory or viral enough to get the victim to reply or forward. The value of what you could steal that way is probably small most of the time but users will not see it that way.Flags: sec-bounty? → sec-bounty+Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---) → [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

Oops, I missed [bug 868267 comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=868267#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - HTML mail compose self-XSS due to signature text") from Mark that describes this bug. It was filed a few hours before mail about this bug was sent to us. We're awarding a split bug bounty for this one.

Thanks for all the cooperation and coordination. It is a totally fair decision to split the bug bounty reward because we detected the core problem with the effects around and the other researcher detected only a part of the issue in the signature like discussed ago. Good job and absolutly fair decision! We really like the transparent coordination via bugzilla.

I've just done some retesting of what I'd originally done in [bug 868267](/show_bug.cgi?id=868267 "RESOLVED FIXED - HTML mail compose self-XSS due to signature text"). This bug does not seem to affect TB 23/24/25. It does affect TB 17.
afaict in all cases the docshell is getting the allowJavascript attribute set to false.

Now Thunderbird 17.0.x series is obsolete and updates have been offered to TB 17esr users, I have re-tested Thunderbird 24.0.x and it is still unaffected by this issue. Therefore resolving this as WFM.
It would still have been nice to figure out what broke/fixed this, but this is no longer an issue.Status: NEW → RESOLVEDClosed: 11 years ago

when bugs like this get marked "works for me" they don't get on the radar for vulnerability notices, and atleast proper credit for discovery of the problem.
probably should be marked as fixed and we should follow up in publishing a vuln notice with the next batch, or we need to expand the query for catching bugs for vuln notes.
could also be time to also open up this bug since details have been posted in several places.
