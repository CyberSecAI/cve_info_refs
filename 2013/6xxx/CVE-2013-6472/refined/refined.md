Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-6472:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from MediaWiki's insufficient handling of deleted page information in various interfaces, despite the intended "RevDel DELETED\_ACTION" functionality. This functionality is designed to hide log entries related to deleted pages. However, the information remained accessible in certain areas.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:**  Deleted page information, which should be hidden, was still accessible via:
    *   The log API (`list=logevents`), which returned the page ID.
    *   User watchlists, where deleted pages' log entries appeared.
    *   Enhanced RecentChanges, where page titles and namespaces might be exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:**  An attacker or unauthorized user could gain knowledge of deleted page titles and namespaces, which they should not have access to. This potentially reveals information that was intended to be hidden.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Access:** Directly querying the API with `list=logevents`.
*   **Watchlists:**  Having a deleted page on their watchlist.
*  **Recent Changes:** Viewing the enhanced recent changes feed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **API Access:** The attacker would need the ability to access the MediaWiki API.
*   **Watchlist User:**  The attacker would need a user account with a deleted page on the user's watchlist.
*   **Access to Recent Changes:** Access to the enhanced Recent Changes feed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by a patch that was applied to MediaWiki versions 1.19.10, 1.21.4, and 1.22.1.
*  The initial report of the vulnerability noted that deleted log entries were still visible in Special:Log when searching by target or performer, however this was later retracted by the reporter, due to confusion with test accounts.
* The fix involved modifying how MediaWiki handles and displays log entries, ensuring that deleted page information is properly hidden.
*   The watchlist issue was also resolved as the log entries would no longer be added to the watchlist in the first place.
