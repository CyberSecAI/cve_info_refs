Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2013-6948 is an Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE') vulnerability in the Belkin WeMo Home Automation API server. Specifically, the `peerAddresses` API endpoint is vulnerable to XML injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The WeMo API server's `peerAddresses` endpoint does not properly sanitize or validate XML input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System File Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to read sensitive files from the WeMo device's file system. This could potentially reveal configuration details, credentials, or other sensitive data.
*  **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, XXE vulnerabilities are often leveraged to further attacks, potentially leading to remote code execution by crafting specific requests using file inclusion techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network requests to the vulnerable WeMo API server endpoint.
*   **XML Injection:** The attacker injects malicious XML code into the `peerAddresses` API call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Belkin WeMo device. This could be either from the same local network or remotely if the device is exposed to the internet.
*   **API Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `peerAddresses` API endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided advisory from IOActive highlights the overall security flaws in the Belkin WeMo product line.
*   The CERT vulnerability note provides a clear description of the XXE vulnerability and its association with CVE-2013-6948
*   Belkin has released updates to address the vulnerability, specifically, they updated the WeMo API server to prevent the XML injection attack.
