The provided content is related to CVE-2013-6806.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Exceed OnDemand (EoD) client's ability to be forced into using an older, less secure authentication protocol through a manipulated server response during the initial connection handshake.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Protocol Downgrade: The EoD client can be tricked into using a less secure protocol version by manipulating the server's response during the connection handshake.
- Lack of SSL/TLS: The older authentication protocol sends credentials in cleartext, without establishing an SSL/TLS encrypted channel first.
- Insufficient authentication: The client does not authenticate the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Credentials disclosure: An attacker can intercept and obtain user credentials sent in cleartext.
- Authentication bypass: By downgrading the protocol, the attacker bypasses the secure authentication mechanisms.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM): An attacker must be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between the EoD client and the Cluster Manager server. This can be achieved through techniques such as ARP poisoning, DNS hijacking, or using a rogue access point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be on the same network or have the ability to intercept traffic between the client and server.
- Traffic manipulation: The attacker needs to be able to modify the initial server response during the protocol negotiation.
