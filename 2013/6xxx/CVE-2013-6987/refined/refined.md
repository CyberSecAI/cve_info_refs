CVE-2013-6987: Synology DSM multiple directory traversal
Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient input sanitization in the FileBrowser components of Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM). The software checks if the path starts with a valid shared folder, but fails to properly handle directory traversal sequences ("../") immediately following the shared folder.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Directory traversal vulnerability in multiple CGIs of the FileStation component. Specifically:
  - /webapi/FileStation/html5_upload.cgi
  - /webapi/FileStation/file_delete.cgi
  - /webapi/FileStation/file_download.cgi
  - /webapi/FileStation/file_sharing.cgi
  - /webapi/FileStation/file_share.cgi
  - /webapi/FileStation/file_MVCP.cgi
  - /webapi/FileStation/file_rename.cgi
Impact of exploitation: Authenticated users (even non-administrative) can access, create, delete, or modify system and configuration files, leading to arbitrary file access and potentially system compromise.
Attack vectors:
  - Sending crafted POST requests to vulnerable CGIs with a `path` parameter containing directory traversal sequences immediately after a valid shared folder name (e.g., `/test/../../etc/passwd`).
  - Crafting a GET request with a directory traversal sequence in the `dlink` parameter of the `/fbdownload/` endpoint (e.g., `/fbdownload/?dlink=2f746573742f2e2e2f2e2e2f6574632f706173737764`).
  - Sending crafted POST requests with a `folder_path` parameter that includes directory traversal sequences.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker must be an authenticated user on the Synology DSM system.
