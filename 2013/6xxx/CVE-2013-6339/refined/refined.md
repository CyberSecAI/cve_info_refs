{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `dissect_openwire_type` function in `epan/dissectors/packet-openwire.c` in the OpenWire dissector in Wireshark does not properly handle malformed packets, leading to a large loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed packets",
      "Infinite loop vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by making Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Injecting a malformed packet onto the network.",
      "Convincing someone to open a malicious packet trace file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic or provide a malicious pcap file to the victim's Wireshark instance.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered in the OpenWire dissector due to a flaw in how it determines the amount of data to process, causing a large loop. The fix involves upgrading Wireshark to version 1.10.3 or 1.8.11 and later versions."
