```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The JBossWeb Bayeux component includes the contents of the jsonp request parameter in the response without proper escaping.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of the 'jsonp' request parameter.

Impact of exploitation:
A remote attacker can perform reflected XSS attacks, potentially leading to execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser. If the browser evaluates the response as HTML, this can be exploited by a DOM-based XSS attack.

Attack vectors:
A remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the 'jsonp' request parameter. The server will then reflect this code back to the user in the response.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a crafted "jsonp" parameter and trick a user into visiting it.
