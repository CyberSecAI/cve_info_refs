- **Root cause of vulnerability:** GNU Rush does not properly drop privileges when using the `--lint` option.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper privilege dropping, leading to arbitrary file read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user can read any file on the system that the setuid root `rush` binary has access to, potentially exposing sensitive information (e.g., `/etc/shadow` for password hashes).
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to execute the `rush` command with the `--lint` option, providing the path to the target file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user with the ability to execute `rush`.
