Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to include external stylesheets within SVG files uploaded to MediaWiki. Specifically, by crafting an SVG file that imports an XSLT stylesheet, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript when the SVG file is rendered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of sanitization for SVG stylesheets:** MediaWiki's SVG handling did not initially prevent the use of external stylesheets via `<?xml-stylesheet ...?>` processing instructions.
*   **XSLT processing for SVG:** Browsers processed XSLT stylesheets referenced by SVGs, allowing for transformations that could inject malicious code such as `<script>` tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject and execute malicious JavaScript in the context of a user viewing the crafted SVG.
*   **Account Hijacking:**  A successful XSS attack could lead to account compromise of users who view the malicious SVG image.
*   **Spam Delivery:** The vulnerability could be exploited to deliver spam anonymously by injecting malicious scripts that perform automated actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Crafted SVG File:** An attacker creates a malicious SVG file.
2.  **External Stylesheet Reference:** The SVG includes a processing instruction (`<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="...">`) pointing to an attacker-controlled XSLT stylesheet.
3.  **XSLT Stylesheet with Malicious Payload:** The XSLT stylesheet is crafted to transform the SVG into one that includes a JavaScript payload, such as a `<script>` tag.
4.  **Upload:** The attacker uploads the malicious SVG file to MediaWiki.
5.  **Victim Views the SVG:** When a user views the image, the browser loads and executes the XSLT stylesheet which transforms the SVG to execute the JavaScript payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to upload files:** The attacker needs to be able to upload SVG files to the target MediaWiki instance.
*   **Knowledge of XSLT:** The attacker requires knowledge of XSLT to craft the malicious stylesheet capable of injecting JavaScript.
*   **Public access to XSLT:** The XSLT needs to be served from a location accessible to the end-user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided bug report shows that the vulnerability was reported by Chris Davis from RationalWiki.
*   The fix implemented involved disallowing `<?xml-stylesheet ...?>` processing instructions within SVG files.
*   The fix was backported to MediaWiki versions 1.19, 1.21 and 1.22
*   The bug report mentions that existing malicious SVG files would continue to function until manually removed.
