Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-6360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Trendnet TS-S402 device has a hidden web page that, when accessed, enables the telnet daemon (telnetd) on the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Backdoor:** The presence of hidden web pages (`/backdoor.shtml` and `/cgi-bin/backdoor/index.shtml`) that can be used to enable telnet.
-   **Unprotected Telnet:**  Enabling telnetd opens up a remote access point without proper authentication or access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Full Remote Access:** Attackers can gain full remote access to the device by enabling and connecting to the Telnet service.
-   **Security Compromise:** Once in the device, attackers can perform various malicious activities, including further network intrusion, data exfiltration, and device manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** Attackers send HTTP requests to the specific URLs: `http://device_ip/backdoor.shtml` or `http://device_ip/cgi-bin/backdoor/index.shtml`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Trendnet TS-S402 device. This could be within the same local network or, if the device is exposed, from the internet.
-   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to send HTTP requests to a device.

**Additional details:**
-  The vulnerability was discovered by Andrei Costin of the "FIRMWARE.RE" project.
- The issue was confirmed by Trendnet.
- The vulnerability affects the Trendnet TS-S402 model, specifically firmware version `FW_TS-S402(2.00.11).zip`.
- The discovery is part of a larger effort to analyze embedded device firmware security.

This information provides more details than the basic CVE description, specifically pinpointing the vulnerable URLs and detailing the impact of enabling telnet on the device.
