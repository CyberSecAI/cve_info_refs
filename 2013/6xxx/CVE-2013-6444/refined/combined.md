Hi all,

Sorry for the poor handling here on my part, the build in Fedora took me
by surprise...There are two pywbem CVEs (assigned by Red Hat):

CVE-2013-6418 is about pywbem doing an SSL connection with verification
enabled, closing it, and doing the real data transfer over another
connection with verification disabled.

CVE-2013-6444 is about pywbem failing to verify the URI matches the
Subject of the certificate (missing hostname check).

According to
<http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=31757312> both of
these CVEs are fixed by the following patch:

<http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/attachment.php?list_name=pywbem-devel&message_id=52AF1EE9.8080805%40redhat.com&counter=1>

However, I don't think that is the final fix, and I'm in the wrong
timezone to ask :( so I'm just going to paste the comments from a bug I
won't be able to open:

""
+        for path in (
+                '/etc/pki/tls/certs',
+                '/etc/ssl/certs',
+                '/etc/ssl/certificates'):
+            if os.path.exists(path):
+                get_default_ca_certs._path = path
+                break

I'm not sure if this works because the /etc/pki/tls/certs directory does
not contain individual PEM certificate files under special hashed file
names, which is what SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations expects.

+            ctx = SSL.Context('sslv3')

The above results in an SSL 3.0 client hello:

        Handshake Protocol: Client Hello
            Handshake Type: Client Hello (1)
            Length: 121
            Version: SSL 3.0 (0x0300)
            Random

You need to use 'sslv23' to get the most recent protocol version.

I've gathered some information about the paths you mentioned. I agree
this approach is not correct. Perhaps this is better:

        for path in (
                # newer distributions using update-ca-trust
                '/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt',
                # use these directories as a fallback
                '/etc/ssl/certs',
                '/etc/ssl/certificates'):
            if os.path.exists(path):
                get_default_ca_certs._path = path
                break

On f19+, update-ca-trust is used to regenerate ca bundles under
/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted directory. As you say it's wrong to use
directory path here, since cacertdir_rehash is not used to make symlinks
with hashes.
On f18 and older, '/etc/ssl/certs' is used with symlinks created by
cacertdir_rehash.

If '/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt' does not
exist, the '/etc/ssl/certs' will be used as a fallback.

I will open our bugs soon
(<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1039801> and
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1044246>).

Apologies again for the mess here and lack of a heads up before it went
public.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1044246#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-18 01:14:42 UTC  ``` It was found that PyWBEM, a Python library for making CIM (Common Information Model) operations over HTTP using the WBEM CIM-XML protocol, failed to verify the URI matches the Subject of the certificate. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain name.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1044246#c2)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-19 02:20:12 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer and Stephen Gallagher of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1044246#c3)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-19 02:29:28 UTC  ``` Public now via a Fedora build.
