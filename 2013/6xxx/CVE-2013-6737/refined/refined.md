Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-6737:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Hardware failure diagnostics for a 1691 error in IBM Storwize V7000 Unified systems include customer data fragments. These fragments are unintentionally included in the diagnostic information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Data Leakage:** The system inadvertently exposes customer data fragments within hardware failure diagnostic logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** An authorized user (e.g., a support technician or system administrator with access to diagnostic logs), who might not otherwise have access to the customer data, can potentially view sensitive data.
- **Potential Data Breach:** Depending on the content and nature of the data fragments, this vulnerability can contribute to a potential data breach if the diagnostic information is inappropriately accessed or disseminated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Access to Diagnostic Logs:** The attacker must have legitimate access to system hardware failure diagnostics logs generated by the IBM Storwize V7000 Unified system.
- **Trigger a 1691 error:** The attacker does not need to directly trigger the error, but the error must be present for the diagnostic data to contain the customer data fragments

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authorized User:** The attacker needs to be an authorized user with permission to access hardware failure diagnostics information on the affected system.
- **System Access:** Requires access to the Storwize V7000 Unified system's management interface or backend where these logs can be viewed or extracted.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects IBM Storwize V7000 Unified systems running code releases 1.3.0.0 to 1.4.0.X
- IBM recommends upgrading to code level 1.4.3.0 or higher to fix the vulnerability.
- A workaround is provided by ensuring all users are authenticated by an external security system, such as a firewall. However, this is not a complete solution.
