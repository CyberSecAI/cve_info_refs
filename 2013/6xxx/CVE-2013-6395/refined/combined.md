Sorry for reporting this so late, there were some health issues and a vacation in the way.

=== Security Advisory ===

## Ganglia-Web 3.5.10 - XSS

# Affected Version

At least ganglia-web-3.5.8 and ganglia-web-3.5.10

# Problem Overview

Technical Risk: medium

Likelihood of Exploitation: medium

Vendor: Open Source / Debian

Reported by: Eric Sesterhenn snakebyte@gmx.de

Advisory updates: <http://www.rusty-ice.de/advisory/advisory_2013002.txt>

Advisory Status: Private

# Problem Impact

While taking a quick look at the web interface, a

XSS issue has been found. It is possible to execute JavaScript

in a victims' browser after tricking the victim into

opening a specially crafted URL.

# Problem Description

The following URL opens a JavaScript popup in the users'

browser:

<http://localhost/ganglia-web-3.5.8/?r=custom&cs=1&ce=1&s=by+name&c=1&h=&host_regex=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E&max_graphs=0&tab=m&vn=&hide-hf=false&sh=1&z=small&hc=0>

The GET variable is retrieved in file get\_context.php, line 89

and placed into the variable $user['host\_regex'] without

escaping. This variable is then placed into the $set\_host\_regex\_value

variable in file header.php, line 494 and printed at line 518.

# Temporary Workaround and Fix

Apply the following patch to properly encode the variable:

--- header.php.old 2013-09-30 21:07:26.272287657 +0200

+++ header.php 2013-09-30 21:09:42.226281990 +0200

Hi Eric,

The security team recently made an assessment of Ganglia and decided to
only provide limited security support for the web interface.

Normally the web interface is only used by knowledgeable users and
protected by some kind of web server ACL or HTTP authentication scheme.

At best, pkg-monitoring will continue packaging the upstream releases
and people can use them as they are.

As well as helping with the Debian packages, I'm also an upstream
committer, so please submit your fix as a github pull request upstream
and if nobody else processes I can accept it through there and it will
then come through the next upstream release into Debian.

Can you please let me know if this explanation is acceptable, lower the
severity to important and let me know if you would like to get more
involved with the Ganglia development

Thanks for the report

Regards,

Daniel

I just submitted the pull request, you can see my branch here:
<https://github.com/SesterhennEric/ganglia-web>

I am just browsing random packages while commuting to work and see what pops up,
so I am not getting highly involved in Ganglia.

Best regards,
Eric

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
