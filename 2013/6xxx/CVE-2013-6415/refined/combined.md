| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1036910#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2013-12-02 21:38:24 UTC  ``` Quoting from an upcoming Ruby on Rails security advisory:   XSS Vulnerability in number_to_currency  There is an XSS vulnerability in the number_to_currency helper in Ruby on Rails. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2013-6415](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-6415).  Versions Affected:  All. Fixed Versions:     4.0.2, 3.2.16.  Impact  ------  The number_to_currency helper allows users to nicely format a numeric value. One of the parameters to the helper (unit) is not escaped correctly.  Application which pass user controlled data as the unit parameter are vulnerable to an XSS attack.  All users passing user controlled data as number_to_currency's unit parameters should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.   Releases  --------  The 4.0.2 and 3.2.16 releases are available at the normal locations.   Credits  -------  Thanks to Ankit Gupta for reporting the issue to us and working with us on a fix.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1036910#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2013-12-02 21:47:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 831790](attachment.cgi?id=831790&action=diff "Upstream patch for 3.2.x") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=831790&action=edit "Upstream patch for 3.2.x") Upstream patch for 3.2.x   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1036910#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2013-12-02 21:48:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 831792](attachment.cgi?id=831792&action=diff "Upstream patch for 4.0.x") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=831792&action=edit "Upstream patch for 4.0.x") Upstream patch for 4.0.x   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1036910#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2013-12-04 10:35:35 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in 3.2.16 and 4.0.2:  <http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/12/3/Rails_3_2_16_and_4_0_2_have_been_released/> <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ruby-security-ann/9WiRn2nhfq0> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q4/402>  Upstream commits (3.2 and 4.0):  <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/5ed70c591fa086d745b35a16713d91fc0e3ec858> <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/6658782d60651a65efc43b621225543dd30125c5>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1036910#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-12-05 22:04:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2013:1794 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1794.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1036910#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-06 18:04:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2014:0008 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0008.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1036910#c14)  Kurt Seifried    2014-11-13 06:22:09 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting this issue.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0008)

## Topic

Updated ruby193-rubygem-actionpack packages that fix multiple security
issues are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ruby on Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web
application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the
view components.

A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails performed JSON parameter parsing.
An application using a third party library, which uses the Rack::Request
interface, or custom Rack middleware could bypass the protection
implemented to fix the CVE-2013-0155 vulnerability, causing the application
to receive unsafe parameters and become vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155.
(CVE-2013-6417)

It was discovered that the internationalization component of Ruby on Rails
could, under certain circumstances, return a fallback HTML string that
contained user input. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
perform a reflective cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by providing a
specially crafted input to an application using the aforementioned
component. (CVE-2013-4491)

A denial of service flaw was found in the header handling component of
Action View. A remote attacker could send strings in specially crafted
headers that would be cached indefinitely, which would result in all
available system memory eventually being consumed. (CVE-2013-6414)

It was found that the number\_to\_currency Action View helper did not
properly escape the unit parameter. An attacker could use this flaw to
perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an application that uses
data submitted by a user in the unit parameter. (CVE-2013-6415)

Users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1863)

## Topic

Updated Subscription Asset Manager 1.4 packages that fix multiple security
issues are now available.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager acts as a proxy for handling
subscription information and software updates on client machines. Red Hat
Subscription Asset Manager is built on Ruby on Rails, a
model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.
Action Pack implements the controller and the view components.

A directory traversal flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled
wildcard segments in routes with implicit rendering. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to retrieve arbitrary local files accessible to a Ruby
on Rails application using the aforementioned routes via a specially
crafted request. (CVE-2014-0130)

A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled hashes in certain
queries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial of
service (resource consumption) attack by sending specially crafted queries
that would result in the creation of Ruby symbols, which were never garbage
collected. (CVE-2013-1854)

Two cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in Action Pack. A remote
attacker could use these flaws to conduct XSS attacks against users of an
application using Action Pack. (CVE-2013-1855, CVE-2013-1857)

It was discovered that the internationalization component of Ruby on Rails
could, under certain circumstances, return a fallback HTML string that
contained user input. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
perform a reflective cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by providing a
specially crafted input to an application using the aforementioned
component. (CVE-2013-4491)

A denial of service flaw was found in the header handling component of
Action View. A remote attacker could send strings in specially crafted
headers that would be cached indefinitely, which would result in all
available system memory eventually being consumed. (CVE-2013-6414)

It was found that the number\_to\_currency Action View helper did not
properly escape the unit parameter. An attacker could use this flaw to
perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an application that uses
data submitted by a user in the unit parameter. (CVE-2013-6415)

Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Ben Murphy as the original reporter of
CVE-2013-1854, Charlie Somerville as the original reporter of
CVE-2013-1855, Alan Jenkins as the original reporter of CVE-2013-1857,
Peter McLarnan as the original reporter of CVE-2013-4491, Toby Hsieh as the
original reporter of CVE-2013-6414, and Ankit Gupta as the original
reporter of CVE-2013-6415.

All Subscription Asset Manager users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1036922#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2013-12-02 22:19:09 UTC  ``` Quoting from an upcoming Ruby on Rails security advisory:   Reflective XSS Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails  There is a vulnerability in the internationalization component of Ruby on Rails. Under certain common configurations an attacker can provide specially crafted input which will execute a reflective XSS attack.  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2013-4491](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4491).  Versions Affected:  3.0.6 and all later versions. Not affected:       3.0.5 and earlier 3.0.x versions. Fixed Versions:     4.0.2, 3.2.16.  The root cause of this issue is a vulnerability in the i18n gem which has been assigned the identifier [CVE-2013-4492](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4492). For this reason applications are also not affected if they have upgraded to the following i18n versions:  * i18n-0.6.6 for Rails 4.0.x and 3.2.x applications * i18n-0.5.1 for Rails 3.1.x and 3.0.x applications  Impact  ------  When the i18n gem is unable to provide a translation for a given string, it creates a fallback HTML string.  Under certain common configurations this string can contain user input which would allow an attacker to execute a reflective XSS attack.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.   Releases  --------  The 4.0.2 and 3.2.16 releases are available at the normal locations.   Credits  -------  Thanks to Peter McLarnan of Matasano Security for reporting the issue to us, and to Sven Fuchs and Christopher Dell for working with us on the fix.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1036922#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2013-12-02 22:22:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 831807](attachment.cgi?id=831807&action=diff "Upstream patch for 3.2.x") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=831807&action=edit "Upstream patch for 3.2.x") Upstream patch for 3.2.x   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1036922#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2013-12-02 22:23:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 831819](attachment.cgi?id=831819&action=diff "Upstream patch for 4.0.x") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=831819&action=edit "Upstream patch for 4.0.x") Upstream patch for 4.0.x   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1036922#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2013-12-04 10:37:48 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in 3.2.16 and 4.0.2:  <http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/12/3/Rails_3_2_16_and_4_0_2_have_been_released/> <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ruby-security-ann/pLrh6DUw998> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q4/401>  Upstream commits (3.2 and 4.0):  <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/78790e4bceedc632cb40f9597792d7e27234138a> <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/ec16ba75a5493b9da972eea08bae630eba35b62f>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1036922#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-12-05 22:04:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2013:1794 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1794.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1036922#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-06 18:04:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2014:0008 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0008.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1036922#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2014-11-13 06:18:29 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting this issue.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1794)

## Topic

Updated ruby193-rubygem-actionpack packages that fix multiple security
issues are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ruby on Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web
application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the
view components.

A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails performed JSON parameter parsing.
An application using a third party library, which uses the Rack::Request
interface, or custom Rack middleware could bypass the protection
implemented to fix the CVE-2013-0155 vulnerability, causing the application
to receive unsafe parameters and become vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155.
(CVE-2013-6417)

It was discovered that the internationalization component of Ruby on Rails
could, under certain circumstances, return a fallback HTML string that
contained user input. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
perform a reflective cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by providing a
specially crafted input to an application using the aforementioned
component. (CVE-2013-4491)

A denial of service flaw was found in the header handling component of
Action View. A remote attacker could send strings in specially crafted
headers that would be cached indefinitely, which would result in all
available system memory eventually being consumed. (CVE-2013-6414)

It was found that the number\_to\_currency Action View helper did not
properly escape the unit parameter. An attacker could use this flaw to
perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an application that uses
data submitted by a user in the unit parameter. (CVE-2013-6415)

All ruby193-rubygem-actionpack users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
