# [OSSA 2013-037] DoS attack via setting os\_type in snapshots (CVE-2013-6437)

### Bug Description

If the os\_type metadata is set of an image, the ephemeral disk backing file for that image will be named ephemeral\_[size]\_[os\_type].

Because the user can change os\_type they can use this to create new ephemeral backing files.

Nova image cache management does not include deleting ephemeral backing files (presumably because they are expected to be a small, stable set.

Hence a user can fill the disk with ephemeral backing files via the following:

1) Spawn a instance

2) Create a snapshot from it, delete the original instance

3) In a loop:

generate a random os\_type

set os\_type to the snapshot

spawn and instance from it, and then delete the instance

Every iteration will generate an ephemeral backing file on a compute host. With a stacking scheduling policy there is a good chance of hitting the same host repeatedly until its disk is full.

Suggested mitigation

Only use “os\_type” in the ephemeral file name if there is a specific mkfs command defined, otherwise use “default” (Currently for undefined os-types it will use the default mkfs command, but still uses os\_type in the name.

I went looking through the code to figure out any implications of changing the backing file name and honestly I'm lost in image caching code, but as far as I can tell the suggested fix should work and would be fairly easy.

Phil, are you going to submit a patch for this?

  (4.9 KiB,
  text/plain)

Attached is a patch that contains a solution

Never submitted tin this way before so not sure what is required

Commit message: >>

use 'os\_type' in ephemeral filename only if mkfs defined

Currently for undefined os-types it will use the default mkfs command, but use the meta 'os\_type' in the name of the ephemeral file (e.g. ephemeral\_20\_abcdef). Which can result in a lot of files (DoS?)

This change will only use 'os\_type' in the ephemeral filename if there is a specific mkfs command defined, otherwise it will use 'default' (e.g. ephemeral\_20\_default)

Modifed the tests to test for:

  os\_type=''

  os\_type=None

  os\_type='test' - with no mkfs command specified

  os\_type='test' - with a mkfs command specified

<<

run it up in devstack and it behaves as expected

The patch doesn't seem to apply on stable/havana though - so I guess we need a separate patch file for that.

Any others we need ?

Proposed impact description:

Title: Nova compute DoS through ephemeral disk backing files

Reporter: Phil Day (HP)

Products: Nova

Affects: All supported versions

Description:

Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in the handling of ephemeral disk backing files on Nova compute nodes. By repeatedly spawning new instances of a snapshotted server with random os\_type (and quickly deleting those instances), an authenticated user could generate lots of different ephemeral disk backing files and fill up compute node disks, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service against a Nova setup.

After writing the impact description it appears to me that this DoS vector could end up being costly for the attacker. I tend to consider "costly DoS" to fall in the same category as "normal usage" for a resource provider... Thoughts on that ? Should this still be considered a practical vulnerability ?

In my opinion, it comes down to whether there is typically a quota/rate-limit around these sorts of operations, and whether or not they are likely to be tracked/billed by a provider. But I don't have the answer to those (hopefully someone here with OpenStack operational background can confirm).

Hi Thierry,

A minor clarification on the impact description:

"By repeatedly spawning new instances of a snapshotted server with random os\_type ..." should read " By repeatedly creating snapshots, changing the os\_type to a new random value, and spawning new instances from the snapshot ..."

I don’t think its necessarily that costly - you do have to pay for each instance you create, but it can be the smallest instance needed and doesn’t have to exist any longer than the time to create it. You could probably even kill the instance before it gets to Active (It only needs to get past the creation of the ephemeral backing file) and avoid any billing at all on some systems. Likewise you don't have to keep the snapshots once the instance has been created. Because the ephemeral backing files are never cleared up (its assumed that they are small and a limited set) you don't have to do this at a fast rate to create a long term attack.

Phil

Hi Thierry,
A minor clarification on the impact description:
"By repeatedly spawning new instances of a snapshotted server with random os\_type ..." should read " By repeatedly creating snapshots, changing the os\_type to a new random value, and spawning new instances from the snapshot ..."
I don’t think its necessarily that costly - you do have to pay for each instance you create, but it can be the smallest instance needed and doesn’t have to exist any longer than the time to create it. You could probably even kill the instance before it gets to Active (It only needs to get past the creation of the ephemeral backing file) and avoid any billing at all on some systems. Likewise you don't have to keep the snapshots once the instance has been created. Because the ephemeral backing files are never cleared up (its assumed that they are small and a limited set) you don't have to do this at a fast rate to create a long term attack.

New proposed impact desc:

--------------------------------------------

Title: Nova compute DoS through ephemeral disk backing files

Reporter: Phil Day (HP)

Products: Nova

Affects: All supported versions

Description:

Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in the handling of ephemeral disk backing files on Nova compute nodes. By repeatedly creating snapshots, changing the os\_type to a new random value, and spawning new instances from the snapshot (and quickly deleting those instances), an authenticated user could generate lots of different ephemeral disk backing files and fill up compute node disks, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service against a Nova setup.

--------------------------------------------

@Phil: agreed... waiting for confirmation from other VMT members to go ahead. Would the ephemeral backing files all land on the same server (reaching a state of partial DoS quickly) or be spread across all compute nodes (reaching a state of total DoS but slowly) ?

That depends entirely on the scheduling policy configured in Nova - a stacking model would hit the issue on specific nodes more quickly that a spreading model (so a quicker DoS on specific servers) - but really it’s the total DoS that is the issue which is kind of the same in either case, its just a question of if you fill from the side or from the bottom.

This issue is libvirt specific. Other drivers may or may not have similar issues but the code paths are very different and can't be generalized under this bug. So adding " running the libvirt driver." or something similar to the first sentence should cover it.

commit 6e455cd97f04bf26bbe022be17c57e089cf502f4

Author: Ryan Moore <email address hidden>

Date: Fri Nov 29 14:21:19 2013 +0000

use 'os\_type' in ephemeral filename only if mkfs defined

Currently for undefined os-types it will use the default mkfs

    command, but use the meta 'os\_type' in the name of the

    ephemeral file (e.g. ephemeral\_20\_abcdef). Which can result

    in a lot of files (DoS?)

    This change will only use 'os\_type' in the ephemeral filename

    if there is a specific mkfs command defined, otherwise it will

    use 'default' (e.g. ephemeral\_20\_default)

Modifed the tests to test for:

      os\_type=''

      os\_type=None

      os\_type='test' - with no mkfs command specified

      os\_type='test' - with a mkfs command specified

Closes-Bug: 1253980

### Bug Description

If the os\_type metadata is set of an image, the ephemeral disk backing file for that image will be named ephemeral\_[size]\_[os\_type].

Because the user can change os\_type they can use this to create new ephemeral backing files.

Nova image cache management does not include deleting ephemeral backing files (presumably because they are expected to be a small, stable set.

Hence a user can fill the disk with ephemeral backing files via the following:

1) Spawn a instance

2) Create a snapshot from it, delete the original instance

3) In a loop:

generate a random os\_type

set os\_type to the snapshot

spawn and instance from it, and then delete the instance

Every iteration will generate an ephemeral backing file on a compute host. With a stacking scheduling policy there is a good chance of hitting the same host repeatedly until its disk is full.

Suggested mitigation

Only use “os\_type” in the ephemeral file name if there is a specific mkfs command defined, otherwise use “default” (Currently for undefined os-types it will use the default mkfs command, but still uses os\_type in the name.

See [original description](comments/0)

I went looking through the code to figure out any implications of changing the backing file name and honestly I'm lost in image caching code, but as far as I can tell the suggested fix should work and would be fairly easy.

Phil, are you going to submit a patch for this?

  [Edit](/nova/%2Bbug/1253980/%2Battachment/3919970)
  (4.9 KiB,
  text/plain)

Attached is a patch that contains a solution

Never submitted tin this way before so not sure what is required

Commit message: >>

use 'os\_type' in ephemeral filename only if mkfs defined

Currently for undefined os-types it will use the default mkfs command, but use the meta 'os\_type' in the name of the ephemeral file (e.g. ephemeral\_20\_abcdef). Which can result in a lot of files (DoS?)

This change will only use 'os\_type' in the ephemeral filename if there is a specific mkfs command defined, otherwise it will use 'default' (e.g. ephemeral\_20\_default)

Modifed the tests to test for:

  os\_type=''

  os\_type=None

  os\_type='test' - with no mkfs command specified

  os\_type='test' - with a mkfs command specified

<<

run it up in devstack and it behaves as expected

Patch looks good to me too - nice work.

The patch doesn't seem to apply on stable/havana though - so I guess we need a separate patch file for that.

Any others we need ?

master patch looks good to me, too. Thanks!

So we just need the stable backports now. moorryan, do you think you can work on some backports, too?

Proposed impact description:

Title: Nova compute DoS through ephemeral disk backing files

Reporter: Phil Day (HP)

Products: Nova

Affects: All supported versions

Description:

Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in the handling of ephemeral disk backing files on Nova compute nodes. By repeatedly spawning new instances of a snapshotted server with random os\_type (and quickly deleting those instances), an authenticated user could generate lots of different ephemeral disk backing files and fill up compute node disks, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service against a Nova setup.

After writing the impact description it appears to me that this DoS vector could end up being costly for the attacker. I tend to consider "costly DoS" to fall in the same category as "normal usage" for a resource provider... Thoughts on that ? Should this still be considered a practical vulnerability ?

In my opinion, it comes down to whether there is typically a quota/rate-limit around these sorts of operations, and whether or not they are likely to be tracked/billed by a provider. But I don't have the answer to those (hopefully someone here with OpenStack operational background can confirm).

Hi Thierry,

A minor clarification on the impact description:

"By repeatedly spawning new instances of a snapshotted server with random os\_type ..." should read " By repeatedly creating snapshots, changing the os\_type to a new random value, and spawning new instances from the snapshot ..."

I don’t think its necessarily that costly - you do have to pay for each instance you create, but it can be the smallest instance needed and doesn’t have to exist any longer than the time to create it. You could probably even kill the instance before it gets to Active (It only needs to get past the creation of the ephemeral backing file) and avoid any billing at all on some systems. Likewise you don't have to keep the snapshots once the instance has been created. Because the ephemeral backing files are never cleared up (its assumed that they are small and a limited set) you don't have to do this at a fast rate to create a long term attack.

Phil

That depends entirely on the scheduling policy configured in Nova - a stacking model would hit the issue on specific nodes more quickly that a spreading model (so a quicker DoS on specific servers) - but really it’s the total DoS that is the issue which is kind of the same in either case, its just a question of if you fill from the side or from the bottom.

This issue is libvirt specific. Other drivers may or may not have similar issues but the code paths are very different and can't be generalized under this bug. So adding " running the libvirt driver." or something similar to the first sentence should cover it.

> Title: Nova compute DoS through ephemeral disk backing files
> Reporter: Phil Day (HP)
> Products: Nova
> Affects: All supported versions
>
> Description:
> Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in the libvirt driver handling of
> ephemeral disk backing files on Nova compute nodes. By repeatedly creating
> snapshots, changing the os\_type to a new random value, and spawning new
> instances from the snapshot (and quickly deleting those instances), an
> authenticated user could generate lots of different ephemeral disk backing
> files and fill up compute node disks, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service
> against a Nova setup. Only Nova setups running the libvirt driver are
> affected.

commit 6e455cd97f04bf26bbe022be17c57e089cf502f4

Author: Ryan Moore <email address hidden>

Date: Fri Nov 29 14:21:19 2013 +0000

use 'os\_type' in ephemeral filename only if mkfs defined

Currently for undefined os-types it will use the default mkfs

    command, but use the meta 'os\_type' in the name of the

    ephemeral file (e.g. ephemeral\_20\_abcdef). Which can result

    in a lot of files (DoS?)

    This change will only use 'os\_type' in the ephemeral filename

    if there is a specific mkfs command defined, otherwise it will

    use 'default' (e.g. ephemeral\_20\_default)

Modifed the tests to test for:

      os\_type=''

      os\_type=None

      os\_type='test' - with no mkfs command specified

      os\_type='test' - with a mkfs command specified

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

By repeatedly creating snapshots, changing the os_type to a new random value, and spawning new instances from the snapshot (and quickly deleting those instances), an authenticated user could generate lots of different ephemeral disk backing files and fill up compute node disks, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service against a Nova setup. Only Nova setups running the libvirt driver are affected.   [CVE-2013-6437](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-6437) has been assigned to identify this flaw.   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Phil Day from HP as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1043106#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-12-13 23:31:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 836520](attachment.cgi?id=836520&action=diff "grizzly patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=836520&action=edit "grizzly patch") grizzly patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1043106#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-12-13 23:33:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 836521](attachment.cgi?id=836521&action=diff "havana patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=836521&action=edit "havana patch") havana patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1043106#c4)  Vincent Danen    2013-12-13 23:34:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 836523](attachment.cgi?id=836523&action=diff "icehouse patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=836523&action=edit "icehouse patch") icehouse patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1043106#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-04 19:04:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 4 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2014:0231 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0231.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1043106#c7)  Garth Mollett    2014-07-15 06:11:12 UTC  ``` Trackers were never added for fedora/rdo when this was unembargoed.

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix multiple security issues and
several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

It was discovered that the metadata agent in OpenStack Networking was
missing an authorization check on the device ID that is bound to a specific
port. A remote tenant could guess the instance ID bound to a port and
retrieve metadata of another tenant, resulting in information disclosure.
Note that only OpenStack Networking setups running neutron-metadata-agent
were affected. (CVE-2013-6419)

It was found that nova used directories that were writable to by all local
users to temporarily store live snapshots. A local attacker with access to
such a directory could use this flaw to read and modify the contents of
live snapshots. (CVE-2013-7048)

A flaw was found in the way the libvirt driver handled short-lived disk
back-up files on Compute nodes. An authenticated attacker could use this
flaw to create a large number of such files, exhausting all available space
on Compute node disks, and potentially causing a denial of service.
Note that only Compute setups using the libvirt driver were affected.
(CVE-2013-6437)

It was discovered that the libvirt driver did not properly handle live
migration of virtual machines. An authenticated attacker could use this
flaw to gain access to a snapshot of a migrated virtual machine. Note that
only setups using KVM live block migration were affected. (CVE-2013-7130)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting
CVE-2013-6419, CVE-2013-6437, and CVE-2013-7130. Upstream acknowledges
Aaron Rosen of VMware as the original reporter of CVE-2013-6419, Phil Day
from HP as the original reporter of CVE-2013-6437, and Loganathan Parthipan
as the original reporter of CVE-2013-7130.

These updated openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream
version 2013.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous
version. (BZ#1065317)

Bug fixes:

* The GlusterFS volume connector in nova did not pass a port to libvirt for

the GlusterFS disk specification. Attaching a volume failed with a libvirt
error indicating the port field was missing. This update fixes this bug by
providing the default Gluster port in nova. (BZ#1020979)

* The database back end did not handle the 2013 MySQL error code (Lost

connection). The 2013 MySQL error code has been added to the collection of
known database error codes. (BZ#1060771)

* OpenStack Compute set the smbios product/vendor information to OpenStack

values, which Red Hat Satellite 5 did not recognize when processing
entitlements. (BZ#1059414)

* Prior to this update, nova-api did not pass the absolute path of the

configuration file to the api-paste library if a file with the same name
was found in the current directory. (BZ#1039554)

* The definition of the libvirt\_info method in the RBD back-end class was

missing a positional argument that the base class defined. (BZ#1063445)

* Rebooting a host caused all of its instances to stop and change to the

SHUTDOWN power state. The unpause action was only allowed on instances with
the PAUSED power state. (BZ#1047863)

* The previous default of writing zeros over deleted volumes took a

significant amount of time. It is now possible to set a global
configuration setting to clear only a part of a volume, or to disable
clearing completely. Additionally, a new 'shred' capability is available to
overwrite volumes with random data instead of zeros. (BZ#1062377)

* In OpenStack Compute, low-level QPID debug log messages are no longer

shown by default. These previously appeared due to the 'level=debug'
parameter set in the nova.conf file. (BZ#1047849)

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues.

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-037
CVE: CVE-2013-6437
Date: December 18, 2013
Title: Nova compute DoS through ephemeral disk backing files
Reporter: Phil Day (HP)
Products: Nova
Affects: All supported versions

Description:
Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in the libvirt driver handling
of ephemeral disk backing files on Nova compute nodes. By repeatedly
creating snapshots, changing the os_type to a new random value, and
spawning new instances from the snapshot (and quickly deleting those
instances), an authenticated user could generate lots of different
ephemeral disk backing files and fill up compute node disks, potentially
resulting in a Denial of Service against a Nova setup. Only Nova setups
running the libvirt driver are affected.
