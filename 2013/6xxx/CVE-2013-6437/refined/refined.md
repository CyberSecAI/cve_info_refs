  "CVE-2013-6437": {
    "description": "A vulnerability exists in the libvirt driver of OpenStack Compute (nova) related to handling ephemeral disk backing files. By manipulating the 'os_type' metadata of a snapshot and repeatedly creating instances, an authenticated user can generate numerous backing files, filling the compute node's disk, potentially causing a denial of service.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the libvirt driver names ephemeral disk backing files using the 'os_type' metadata. If a specific mkfs command is not defined for the os_type the default command is used, but the 'os_type' metadata is still included in the file name which allows an attacker to create many different ephemeral backing file names and thus files.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of proper checks on 'os_type' metadata for ephemeral disk file naming.",
        "Absence of cleanup/deletion of ephemeral backing files in Nova's image cache management."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) on compute nodes due to disk space exhaustion. This occurs because the attacker can fill the disk with ephemeral backing files.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Creating snapshots of instances",
        "Modifying the 'os_type' metadata of snapshots",
        "Repeatedly creating instances from the modified snapshots",
        "Deleting these instances after creation of the disk files"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "Authenticated user access to OpenStack",
        "Ability to create snapshots, modify their metadata (os_type), and create instances"
      ],
    "mitigation": "The fix involves modifying the libvirt driver to use the os_type in the ephemeral file name only if a specific mkfs command is defined for that os_type; otherwise a default name will be used."
