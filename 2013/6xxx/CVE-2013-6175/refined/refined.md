Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6175:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the xAdmin application of EMC Document Sciences xPression, specifically in the `marker_name` parameter of the `/xAdmin/html/op_xp_marker_gen.jsp` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically a stored XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary scripts into the application. When a user views the affected page, the injected script will execute in the user's browser, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the application
  - Stealing of sensitive information
  - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted request containing malicious JavaScript within the `marker_name` parameter of the `/xAdmin/html/op_xp_marker_gen.jsp` file.
- This is a stored XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is stored within the application and executed later when a user accesses the affected functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to make requests to the xAdmin application.
- The attacker must be able to submit or manipulate the `marker_name` parameter within the specified file.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability is present in EMC Document Sciences xPression 4.2 Patch 16 and potentially earlier versions.
- The document also mentions reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the xAdmin and xDashboard applications through various parameters, although this is not specific to CVE-2013-6175.
- Other CVEs related to the same product are also described including path traversal (CVE-2013-6177), SQL injection (CVE-2013-6176), Open redirect (CVE-2013-6174) and CSRF (CVE-2013-6173).
