Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Subversion plugin for Jenkins was not using the proper Jenkins core security mechanism for storing credentials. Instead, it was scrambling passwords and SSH private key passphrases using Base64 encoding, which is easily reversible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Passwords and SSH private key passphrases were stored in a format that was easily decoded (Base64), instead of using the stronger encryption methods provided by the Jenkins core.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** This weak encryption exposed sensitive information, such as passwords and passphrases for accessing Subversion repositories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Compromised Subversion Access:** Attackers with local system access to the Jenkins controller could decode the stored credentials and gain unauthorized access to Subversion repositories. This could lead to:
    *   Unauthorized code modifications.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Malicious insertion of code.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local System Access:** The primary attack vector requires an attacker to have local access to the Jenkins controller. This could be through compromised accounts or direct system access.
*   **Access to Configuration Files:** Attackers would need to access the Jenkins configuration files where the credentials were stored. Specifically files like <JOB>/subversion.credentials could contain the base64 encoded credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local System Access to Jenkins Controller:** The attacker needs to have access to the file system of the Jenkins controller where the credentials are stored.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know that the data is base64 encoded and how to decode it.
*   **Jenkins Configuration Access:** The attacker needs to be able to read the Jenkins configuration files to obtain the credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was found by Lennart Starr and reported by Kohsuke Kawaguchi.
*   The fix was released in Subversion plugin version 1.54.
*   Red Hat addressed the issue in Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.1 via RHBA-2014:1630.
*   The severity is rated as "low" due to the requirement of local access to the Jenkins controller.

This information provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, its cause, impact, and how it can be exploited. It also gives additional context beyond the basic description in the CVE.
