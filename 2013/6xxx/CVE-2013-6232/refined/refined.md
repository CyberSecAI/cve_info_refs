  "cve_id": "CVE-2013-6232",
  "description": "SpagoBI contains a flaw that allows persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This flaw exists because the application does not validate certain unspecified input before returning it to the user. This may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not validate certain unspecified input before returning it to the user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, client-side phishing, client-side external redirects or malware loads and client-side manipulation of the vulnerable module context.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can insert a note with javascript code (e.g., `<object data=\"javascript:alert('XSS')\"></object>`) and save it in public mode. The code execution happens when a victim clicks on annotate document detail.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A SpagoBI malicious user with a restricted account is required to insert the malicious code. Low or medium user interaction is required for exploitation."
  },
   "affected_versions": "This vulnerability was tested against: SpagoBI 4.0. Older versions are probably affected too.",
  "fix_versions": "This issue is fixed in SpagoBI v4.1"
