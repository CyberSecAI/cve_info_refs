Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6731:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in IBM Netezza Performance Portal 2.0, where an authenticated user, who should not have the ability to manage other user's accounts, can still change their passwords.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The system fails to properly verify if an authenticated user has the necessary privileges to modify another user's password.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with limited account management privileges can escalate their privileges to modify another user's account.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could change the password of another user, potentially leading to unauthorized access to that user's account and data.
- This can have serious impact on data confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is exploited via a POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of IBM Netezza Performance Portal.
- The attacker does not need any specific elevated privileges other than the ability to log into the application.
