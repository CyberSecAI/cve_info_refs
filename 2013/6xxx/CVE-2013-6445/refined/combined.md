# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

Updated Messaging component packages that fix one security issue, several
bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
MRG 2.5 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

MRG Messaging is a high-speed reliable messaging distribution for Linux
based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open protocol
standard for enterprise messaging that is designed to make mission critical
messaging widely available as a standard service, and to make enterprise
messaging interoperable across platforms, programming languages, and
vendors. MRG Messaging includes an AMQP 0-10 messaging broker; AMQP 0-10
client libraries for C++, Java JMS, and Python; as well as persistence
libraries and management tools.

It was found that MRG Management Console (cumin) used the crypt(3)
DES-based hash function to hash passwords. DES-based hashing has known
weaknesses that allow an attacker to more easily recover plain text
passwords from hashes via brute-force guessing. An attacker able to
compromise a cumin user database could potentially use this flaw to recover
plain text passwords from the password hashes stored in that database.
(CVE-2013-6445)

Note: In deployments where user account information is stored in a database
managed by cumin, it is recommended that users change their passwords after
this update is applied.

This issue was discovered by Tomáš Nováčik of the Red Hat MRG Quality
Engineering team.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds enhancements.
Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

All users of the Messaging capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are
advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues
and add these enhancements. After installing the updated packages, stop the
cluster by either running "service qpidd stop" on all nodes, or
"qpid-cluster --all-stop" on any one of the cluster nodes. Once stopped,
restart the cluster with "service qpidd start" on all nodes for the update
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1044315#c0)  David Jorm    2013-12-18 05:25:48 UTC  ``` It was found that cumin used the crypt(3) DES-based hash function with insufficient salt to store passwords. This hash function has known weaknesses, and an attacker who compromises the user database could use this flaw to recover plaintext passwords.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1044315#c1)  David Jorm    2013-12-18 05:26:40 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Tomáš Nováčik of the Red Hat MRG Quality Engineering team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1044315#c2)  David Jorm    2013-12-18 05:28:06 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1043443](show_bug.cgi?id=1043443) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1044315#c13)  Trevor McKay    2014-02-07 22:00:02 UTC  ``` Easy to test:  1) Copy a user database from a previous version of cumin  cumin-admin export-users users  2) Verify that the password fields have no salt prefix (more users) 3) Set up the new version of cumin 4) Import the user database  cumin-admin import-users users  5) Run cumin and log in as an old user -- proves that old hashes still work  6) Use change password to set the user's password to the same value 7) Log out and log in again -- works 8) Add a brand new user  cumin-admin add-user newguy somepassword  9) Export the user db and verify that the $6 salt prefix is added in both cases  cumin-admin export-users updated_users   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1044315#c14)  Trevor McKay    2014-02-07 22:02:38 UTC  ``` Note, if we want a security advisory on this, uses can just be instructed to change their password the next time they log in after installation.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0440)

## Topic

Updated Grid component packages that fix two security issues, multiple
bugs, and provide several enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2.5 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

MRG Grid provides high-throughput computing and enables enterprises to
achieve higher peak computing capacity as well as improved infrastructure
utilization by leveraging their existing technology to build high
performance grids. MRG Grid provides a job-queueing mechanism, scheduling
policy, and a priority scheme, as well as resource monitoring and resource
management. Users submit their jobs to MRG Grid, where they are placed into
a queue. MRG Grid then chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a
policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user
upon completion.

A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way MongoDB handled BSON data.
A database user permitted to insert BSON data into a MongoDB server could
use this flaw to read server memory, potentially disclosing sensitive data.
(CVE-2012-6619)

Note: This update addresses CVE-2012-6619 by enabling the "--objcheck"
option in the /etc/mongodb.conf file. If you have edited this file, the
updated version will be stored as /etc/mongodb.conf.rpmnew, and you will
need to merge the changes into /etc/mongodb.conf manually.

It was found that MRG Management Console (cumin) used the crypt(3)
DES-based hash function to hash passwords. DES-based hashing has known
weaknesses that allow an attacker to recover plain text passwords from
hashes. An attacker able to compromise a cumin user database could
potentially use this flaw to recover plain text passwords from the password
hashes stored in that database. (CVE-2013-6445)

Note: In deployments where user account information is stored in a database
managed by cumin, it is recommended that users change their passwords after
this update is applied.

The CVE-2013-6445 issue was discovered by Tomáš Nováčik of the Red Hat MRG
Quality Engineering team.

These updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 also provide numerous
bug fixes and enhancements for the Grid component of Red Hat Enterprise
MRG. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory.
Refer to the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document, available
shortly from the link in the References section, for information on
these changes.

All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1049748#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-08 06:36:03 UTC  ``` MongoDB was found to be affected by a memory over-read bug that can be used by an authenticated user (if applicable) to obtain raw MongoDB server process memory contents via incorrect BSON object length.  This issue does not seem to cross a security boundary under most deployments, but for some it could, like differently-privileged MongoDB users, data already deleted from the DB yet staying in process memory, or/and metadata that is not normally retrievable.  References: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/27> <http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2012/11/attacking-mongodb.html> <https://github.com/cyberpunkych/attacking_mongodb> (The files used for the attack demonstration.)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1049748#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-08 17:12:54 UTC  ``` According to <http://www.mongodb.org/about/alerts/#security-related> this issue was corrected on 11/27/2012 and affects version 2.3.1 and earlier, and is corrected in 2.3.2.  It is described as "Object validation (--objcheck) not performed by default."  The upstream original bug report for this is:  <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-7769>  Which indicates the following commits correct the issue:  <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/6889d1658136c753998b4a408dc8d1a3ec28e3b9> <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/f9817a6cf64bdba8e1e1cef30a798110df746b58>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1049748#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-08 17:15:15 UTC  ``` As an aside, there is an implication in the upstream bugs that were duped against SERVER-7769 that this also can cause a denial of service (crash of the mongodb server process).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1049748#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-08 17:24:13 UTC  ``` The upstream report does not indicate when the flaw was introduced, so it is unknown as of yet whether or not 1.x is affected by this at all.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1049748#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2014-01-09 22:01:23 UTC  ``` This issue can be dealt with by using the --objcheck command line switch in older versions of MongoDB, this switch was enabled as the default behavior in version 2.3.2 and later.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1049748#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-04 19:16:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 4 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2014:0230 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0230.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1049748#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-28 16:47:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2014:0440 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0440.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1049748#c11)  Kurt Seifried    2014-08-08 19:26:18 UTC  ``` Red Hat Update Infrastructure 2.1.3 is now in Production 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Update Infrastructure Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhui>.   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1020191#c0)  Tomáš Nováčik    2013-10-17 09:00:45 UTC  ``` Description of problem: There is possibility to sort submissions in cumin according to job id. This sorting is done according to string comparison. Job id title example: localhost.localdomain#100.0, localhost.localdomain#80.0 It consist from domain_name#job_id. Cumin fails to correctly sort submissions which have different count of letters(always when there is difference in number order).   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): cumin-0.1.5786-2  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1.Install cumin according to documentation. 2.Log in as administrator. 3.Go to submission tab and submit 10 jobs with the same description. 3. After jobs completion click on the submission, sort the table according to job id.  Actual results: Submissions are not correctly sorted. (Not according to the job id) Ascending sorting result: localhost.localdomain#1.0 localhost.localdomain#10.0 <-- Error localhost.localdomain#2.0 localhost.localdomain#3.0 localhost.localdomain#4.0 localhost.localdomain#5.0 localhost.localdomain#6.0 localhost.localdomain#7.0 localhost.localdomain#8.0 localhost.localdomain#9.0  Descending sorting result: localhost.localdomain#8.0 localhost.localdomain#7.0 localhost.localdomain#6.0 localhost.localdomain#5.0 localhost.localdomain#4.0 localhost.localdomain#3.0 localhost.localdomain#2.0 localhost.localdomain#10.0 <--- Error localhost.localdomain#1.0  Expected results: Submissions should be sorted according to actual job id.

This can be tweaked by moving the sort logic into the JobSummariesAdapter class derived from ObjectQmfAdapter.  The JobSummariesAdapter class is used only for processing the results of a query on a submission to retrieve job summaries, so it is the perfect place.  No need to put guards on the logic to keep from affecting other tables.  Specific knowledge of the record structure at this level is appropriate.  I tested this with a VM, works for me :)  See the attached patch.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1020191#c9)  Trevor McKay    2013-12-23 17:41:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 840913](attachment.cgi?id=840913&action=diff "Overload sort_rows method to JobSummariesAdapter") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=840913&action=edit "Overload sort_rows method to JobSummariesAdapter") Overload sort_rows method to JobSummariesAdapter  Oops, left out the field index test   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1020191#c11)  Tomáš Nováčik    2014-01-28 08:28:38 UTC  ``` Verified on rhel6x, rhel6i - with cumin-0.1.5796-1.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1020191#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-28 16:47:15 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
