  "CVE-2013-6445": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The MRG Management Console (cumin) used the crypt(3) DES-based hash function to hash passwords. DES-based hashing has known weaknesses that allow an attacker to more easily recover plain text passwords from hashes via brute-force guessing.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The MRG Management Console (cumin) used the crypt(3) DES-based hash function with insufficient salt to hash passwords.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of weak DES-based hashing algorithm",
        "Insufficient salt in password hashing"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who compromises the cumin user database could potentially recover plain text passwords from the password hashes stored in that database via brute-force guessing.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Compromise of the cumin user database."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to compromise the cumin user database to obtain the password hashes.",
      "additional_notes": "In deployments where user account information is stored in a database managed by cumin, it is recommended that users change their passwords after this update is applied. The updated packages will use a stronger hashing algorithm."
