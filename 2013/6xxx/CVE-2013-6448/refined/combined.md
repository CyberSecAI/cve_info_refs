| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1044794#c0)  David Jorm    2013-12-19 03:05:09 UTC  ``` It was found that the InterfaceGenerator handler in JBoss Seam Remoting will expose details of all classes and methods on the server's classpath, not just methods with the org.jboss.seam.annotations.remoting.WebRemote annotation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to determine which classes are deployed on the JBoss server.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1044794#c1)  David Jorm    2013-12-20 01:27:33 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Jon Passki of Coverity SRL for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1044794#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-20 17:32:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.4.0  Via RHSA-2014:0045 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0045.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1044794#c5)  David Jorm    2014-01-21 23:05:09 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/seam2/jboss-seam/commit/090aa6252affc978a96c388e3fc2c1c2688d9bb5>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1044794#c7)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2015-02-11 05:48:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5; Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4 and 5; Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5; Red Hat JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4 and 5; and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5 are now in Phase 3, Extended Life Support, of their respective life cycles.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
