Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-6448:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `InterfaceGenerator` handler in JBoss Seam Remoting. This handler incorrectly exposes details of all classes and methods on the server's classpath, not just those intended for remote access (marked with the `@org.jboss.seam.annotations.remoting.WebRemote` annotation).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is an information disclosure issue. The `InterfaceGenerator` reveals internal server-side class and method details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposed Server Internals:** A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to gain insight into the server's internal structure, including the classes and methods deployed on the JBoss server.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Knowledge of the server's internal components could be leveraged by an attacker to plan and execute more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker exploits this vulnerability via remote network access by sending a specially crafted request to the `InterfaceGenerator` handler within the JBoss Seam Remoting framework.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the JBoss server to reach the vulnerable `InterfaceGenerator` handler.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior authentication

**Additional Details:**

*   **Patch:** The issue was fixed by modifying the `InterfaceGenerator` to only expose methods annotated with `@WebRemote`. Additionally, the fix included the use of a safe XML reader that disables DTD processing to prevent further vulnerabilities.
*   **Upstream Patch:** The fix is available as a commit on GitHub ([https://github.com/seam2/jboss-seam/commit/090aa6252affc978a96c388e3fc2c1c2688d9bb5](https://github.com/seam2/jboss-seam/commit/090aa6252affc978a96c388e3fc2c1c2688d9bb5))
*   **Red Hat Advisory:** Red Hat issued a security advisory (RHSA-2014:0045) to address the vulnerability.
*   **Low Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as having low severity.
*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affected Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.4.0 and other JBoss products that are in extended life support but will not be fixed.
