Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6430:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `JavaScriptUtils.javaScriptEscape()` method in Spring MVC. This method was intended to escape characters that are sensitive in JavaScript contexts (single-quoted strings, double-quoted strings, and HTML script data). However, it failed to escape all necessary characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incomplete Character Escaping:** The `javaScriptEscape()` method did not properly escape the following characters:
    *   Line Separator (`\u2028`)
    *   Paragraph Separator (`\u2029`)
    *   Left Angle Bracket (`<`)
    *   Right Angle Bracket (`>`)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The failure to properly escape these characters could allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages.  While in most cases this would result in a parse error, in some circumstances, it could lead to XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited when user-controlled input is processed by `JavaScriptUtils.javaScriptEscape()` and then rendered in a JavaScript context in a web page.
*   Attackers can insert the unescaped characters into the input that is then passed through the vulnerable method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to inject the vulnerable characters (`<`, `>`, `\u2028`, `\u2029`) into data that will be processed by the affected `javaScriptEscape()` method and then used in an HTML context.
*   The application needs to use the vulnerable `JavaScriptUtils.javaScriptEscape()` method and not implement their own encoding.
*   The attacker requires that the application renders this data in a manner that allows script execution on the client-side (e.g. within a `<script>` tag).

**Additional details:**

*   The issue was identified by Jon Passki and further analyzed by Arun Neelicattu.
*   The fix was implemented by adding the necessary escaping for the mentioned characters within the `javaScriptEscape()` method.
*   The vulnerability is present in Spring Framework versions 3.0.0 to 3.2.1.
*   The fix was introduced in version 3.2.2, meaning users should upgrade to that version or later to mitigate the risk.

The fix was implemented in this commit:  [https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7a7df6637478607bef0277bf52a4e0a03e20a248](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7a7df6637478607bef0277bf52a4e0a03e20a248)
