# CVE-2013-6430 Possible XSS when using Spring MVC

LOW | JANUARY 14, 2014 | CVE-2013-6430
# Description

The JavaScriptUtils.javaScriptEscape() method did not escape all characters that are sensitive within either a JS single quoted string, JS double quoted string, or HTML script data context. In most cases this will result in an unexploitable parse error but in some cases it could result in an XSS vulnerability.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring MVC 3.0.0 to 3.2.1
* Earlier unsupported versions may be affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:

* Users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.2 or later

# Credit

This issue was originally reported to the Spring Framework developers by Jon Passki and the security implications brough to the attention of the Pivotal security team by Arun Neelicattu.

# References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
