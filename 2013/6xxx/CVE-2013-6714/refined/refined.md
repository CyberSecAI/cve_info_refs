- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation due to insufficient access control in the FlashCopy Manager for VMware GUI.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized users can back up and restore VMs that they are not authorized to access, potentially leading to data exposure or manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: By using the FlashCopy Manager for VMware GUI, a user with restricted VMware privileges can bypass those restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a restricted user within VMware and have access to the FlashCopy Manager for VMware GUI.
