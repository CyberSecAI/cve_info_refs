To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

# Security Bulletin: Escalation of Privilege Vulnerability in IBM® DB2® Stored Procedure Infrastructure on Windows (CVE-2013-6744)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Vulnerability in IBM DB2 for Linux, Unix and Windows could allow an authenticated user to obtain elevated privilege on Windows.

## Vulnerability Details

[**CVE ID: CVE-2013-6744**](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2013-6744)

## Affected Products and Versions

The following IBM DB2 and DB2 Connect V9.1, V9.5, V9.7, V10.1 and V10.5 editions running on Windows are vulnerable. DB2 on AIX, Linux, HP and Solaris are not vulnerable.

IBM DB2 Express Edition

IBM DB2 Workgroup Server Edition

IBM DB2 Enterprise Server Edition

IBM DB2 Connect™ Application Server Edition

IBM DB2 Connect Application Server Advanced Edition

IBM DB2 Connect Enterprise Edition

IBM DB2 Connect Unlimited Edition for System i®

IBM DB2 Connect Unlimited Edition for System z®

IBM DB2 Connect Unlimited Advanced Edition for System z

IBM DB2 10.1 pureScale Feature

IBM DB2 10.5 Advanced Enterprise Server Edition

IBM DB2 10.5 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition

IBM DB2 10.5 Developer Edition for Linux, Unix and Windows

NOTE: The DB2 Connect products mentioned are affected only if a local database has been created.

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the appropriate fix for this vulnerability.

**FIX:**

The fix for this vulnerability is available for download for DB2 and DB2 Connect release V10.1 FP4 from Fix Central. Releases V9.7 FP9, V10.1 FP3, and V10.5 FP3 were updated with the fix and is available from Fix Central as V9.7 FP9a, V10.1 FP3a, and V10.5 FP3a, respectively.

A special build with an interim patch for this issue may be requested for DB2 and DB2 Connect V9.5 FP9 & FP10, V9.7 FP8 and V10.5 FP2. Please contact your service representative to request the special build and reference the APAR number for the release you want. Customers on fixpack levels lower than those listed above should update to a fixed fix pack level.

DB2 and DB2 Connect V9.1 are no longer supported and therefore no patch will be made available. Please upgrade to a supported version of DB2 or DB2 Connect, as applicable, and apply the fix. Customers who have an extended support contract for this version may contact support to request a fix under the terms of their contract.

**Enabling the fix:**

The fix is not enabled by default to prevent potential application failures. Enabling the fix will cause stored procedures to run with restricted privileges and the restrictions could potentially cause some user written stored procedures to fail.

There are two parts to enabling the fix. For the first part, follow the instructions in [**Restricting operating system privileges of the db2fmp process (Windows)**](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r5/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.server.doc/doc/t0056059.html) which is applicable to all DB2 releases. With this fix, the stated restriction is removed and LocalSystem can now be used as the DB2 service account.

For the second part, the following command needs to be run from a Windows command prompt by a Windows administrator:

SC SIDTYPE <DB2-service-name> UNRESTRICTED

Where <DB2-service-name> is the name of the Windows service given to the DB2 server. You can view the list of installed services on your machine by using the Windows Services console. After the changes are made, the DB2 server needs to be stopped and restarted for the changes to take effect.

# Security Vulnerabilities, HIPER and Special Attention APARs fixed in DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows Version 10.1

### Flashes (Alerts)

## Abstract

This document contains a list of fixes for Security and HIPER APARs in DB2 Version 10.1.

## Content

A set of security vulnerabilities was discovered in some DB2 database products. These vulnerabilities were analyzed by the DB2 development organization and a set of corresponding fixes were created to address the reported issues. IBM is not currently aware of any externally reported incidents where production DB2 installations have been compromised due to these issues.

The affected DB2 UDB for Linux, UNIX, and Windows products are:

DB2 Enterprise Server Edition

DB2 Workgroup Server (all Editions)

DB2 Express Server (all Editions)

DB2 Personal Edition

DB2 Connect Server (all Editions)

DB2 Client component and DB2 products or components other than those listed above are not affected.

Due to the complexity of the fixes required to eliminate the reported service issues, it is not feasible to retrofit the same fixes into earlier DB2 Version 10.1 fix packs.
