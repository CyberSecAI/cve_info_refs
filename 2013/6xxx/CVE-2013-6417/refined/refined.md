  "CVE-2013-6417": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails performed JSON parameter parsing. An application using a third party library, which uses the Rack::Request interface, or custom Rack middleware could bypass the protection implemented to fix the CVE-2013-0155 vulnerability, causing the application to receive unsafe parameters and become vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155.",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2013-0155. The prior fix was incomplete and the use of common 3rd party libraries can accidentally circumvent the protection. Due to the way that Rack::Request and Rails::Request interact, it is possible for a 3rd party or custom rack middleware to parse the parameters insecurely and store them in the same key that Rails uses for its own parameters.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Bypassing security controls"
     ],
    "impact": "The application will receive unsafe parameters and could be vulnerable to the earlier vulnerability CVE-2013-0155.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can send specially crafted JSON parameters that bypass security controls.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests."
