```
    After struggling with this issue for well over a year and really pushing
    hard to track it down in the last two months I was finally able to come
    up with a test case running 'cc1' from gcc-4.4 in a loop and get it
    to fail in less than 60 seconds.  Prior to finding this case it would
    take anywhere up to 2 days with 48 cores fully loaded to reproduce
    the failure.

				SUMMARY OF PROBLEM

    * Only cc1 (from gcc-4.4.7) on AMD boxes would fail.  The same code & OS
      image on Intel boxes would not fail.

    * Repeated runs with the same arguments etc would not reproduce the bug
      with any consistency.  In otherwords, it could not be a bug in CC1
      itself.  This was further evaluated using a static stackgap and
      telling cc1 to not use a random seed with the same results.

    * No other program was failing due to this issue that I could determine.
      Only cc1.

    * All of cc1's failures occured approximately in the same place, moving
      around a little based on numerous factors (stackgap randomization,
      arguments length, etc... see below).

      They all involved the fill_sons_in_loop() and/or first_dom_son()
      (which is called from fill_sons_in_loop()) functions in GCC 4.4.7.

    * The result is a segmentation fault, bus fault, or other fault related
      to corrupt program state, causing the compiler to report an internal
      compiler failure.

    * The failure has been observed on three different machines, all running
      AMD cpus.  A quad opteron 6168 (48 core) box, and two Phenom II x4 820
      boxes.  All running DragonFly.  However, I believe I have discounted
      the OS as a possible source of the problem (see below).

    * This particular failure has never been observed on an Intel cpu
      (SandyBridge consumer and SandyBridge Xeon E3 tested).

				BUG REPRODUCABILITY

    * The bug is EXTREMELY sensitive to %rip and %rsp values.  Changing the
      codebase under test even a little, for example adding a few nop's to
      an unrelated procedure which shifts the entire code base, greatly
      changed the reproducability of the bug.

    * Similarly for stack addresses.  DragonFly uses the initial stack
      randomization patch from OpenBSD, so repeated runs of the same program
      will start with a (16-byte aligned) stack pointer offset in a 0-1008
      range.

      This also means reproducability is extremely sensitive to the
      argument count, length of program arguments, environment count,
      length of the environment, length of the path to the binary being
      executed, and the signal return code the kernel throws near the
      top of the stack (note: reproducability is unrelated to signals of
      any sort, no signals are taken during the tests).

    * The bug reproduces on DragonFly by simply doing a make -j 20 buildworld
      or other similar buildworld in loop, on an AMD box with known buggy
      cpu's (current known to occur with the AMD Opteron 6168  Id = 0x100f91
      Stepping = 1 -- that's the 12-core opteron by the way, and the
      Phenom II X4 820 (Id = 0x100f42  Stepping = 2).

    * Tested with a recent BIOS as well as with all the errata MSR's
      programmed, at least all the ones I could find.  Nothing fixed it.

    * It originally took about 2 days to reproduce the bug using the
      buildworld test.  Recently I was able to find a test case with a
      particular cc1 line from the buildworld which, combined with a fixed
      environment, command line, and stack gap could reproduce the bug in
      less than 60 seconds.

    * In addition, the fast-reproducing environment was single threaded.
      A single cc1 was executed via vfork/exec and remained on a single
      cpu, with no other machine load.  The bug still reproduced.

      Using different starting stack offsets via DragonFly's stackgap
      feature I was able to find an offset (in my case -904 but it depends
      a ton of everything else placed on the stack by exec) that reproduces
      the bug within 60 seconds.

      By continuing to try different offsets I've determined that high
      reproducability repeats every 32K of offset.  e.g. -904, -33672,
      and so forth.  Once the initial offset is found with high
      reproducability each 32K increment produces another highly
      reproducable case.

    * Finding such an environment on other OS's should be possible but I
      will note that it took a lot of effort just to find a quickly
      reproducable case with DragonFly.  I've been tearing my hair out on
      this bug for over a year now trying to find the 'OS bug' that caused
      it and couldn't find an easily reproducable (DragonFly-specific) case
      until now.

      Probably the only way to reproduce this on another OS consistently
      using my test case is to write a DragonFly syscall emulation layer
      for e.g. FreeBSD.  I may do this to absolutely guarantee that it isn't
      an OS bug in DragonFly, but it's a bit of work and I haven't decided
      if I want to spend the time or not.

    * I am continuing my efforts to reproduce the bug on another OS but
      it isn't going to be easy.  Differences in GCC implementations,
      lack of stackgap randomization, and other issues make this a fairly
      large time consuming affair.

      For example, the gcc-4.4 port on FreeBSD produces code that is radically
      different than the code produced on DragonFly, due to a multitude of
      optimizations that appear to be enabled by default as well as differences
      in the ordering of libraries, code modules during link, libc, and so
      on and so forth.

	    EFFORTS AT FINDING A KERNEL BUG THAT WASN'T A KERNEL BUG

    I now believe this to be a cpu bug.  The following efforts were made
    to determine whether the DragonFly kernel was responsible for the bug.
    Most of these efforts occured before the fast-reproducing case was
    found.

    * There were other bugs in the DFly kernel related to MP operations,
      the pmap code, and the VM object code.  These subsystems were completely
      rewritten (and committed) in the course of researching this bug.

    * I tried prefaulting all stack and text pages AND also forced malloc()
      to bzero() the allocated space.  These changes had NO EFFECT on bug
      reproducability.

    * All user<->kernel transitions (except BIOS SMI which I have no control
      over) recorded the saved %rip and %rsp and compared it against the
      %rip and %rsp upon iret.  This includes system calls, execptions, and
      interrupts.  No discrepencies were found.

    * USB legacy mode was disabled in the BIOS, which greatly changes BIOS
      SMI interrupt rates.  This had NO EFFECT on bug reproducability.

    * The thread switch code in the kernel was modified to unconditionally
      invalidated the TLB.  This had NO EFFECT on bug reproducability.

    * The return-to-user code in the kernel was modified to intentionally
      smash the AMD RAS (Return Address Stack) with a chain of 28 call
      recursions and return sequences.  This had NO EFFECT on bug
      reproducability.

    * All user<->kernel transitions logged the TSC value which was checked
      against the failure point.  Cases were found where NO kernel entry
      occured for at least 8 milliseconds prior to the failure point.

    * We CLI'd the thread switch code.  This had NO EFFECT on bug
      reproducability.

    * The bug reproduced single-threaded and without switching cpu cores
      so we know it can't be due to stale TLB entries.

			    USERLAND DEBUGGING EFFORTS

    * Debugging the issue in userland (and kernelland) is extremely
      difficult because most debugging mechanisms caused the problem
      to stop occuring.

    * The user stack appeared to NOT be corrupt in any way.

    * Either the %rip or the %rsp was clearly wrong.  The stack state
      approximately 544 bytes higher up on the stack seemed to match what
      the code at the failed %rip was trying to do, but the register state
      was 'imposible'.

      In the test case I was able to reproduce most readily the program
      failed at the retq at the end of fill_sons_in_loop().  The retq
      failed with a bus error due to a non-canonical value on the stack
      at the point it tried to retq.  This value was clearly data left over
      on the stack from a local variable in one of the several procedures
      called by fill_sons_in_loop().  The register state that was found
      was very weird...  %r12, %r13, and %r14 matched thec contents of
      the stack at the failure point but registers %rbx and %rbp did not.
      %rbx and %rbp matched the contents of the stack +544 bytes higher
      on the stack (and the stack state +544 bytes higher would have had
      a correct return %rip had the program tried to pop/retq from that
      point instead of where the %rsp at the failure point was).

      NOTE: This assembly dump is from a case where I inserted a
	    MFENCE + NOP at the top of the routine.  The bug still occured.
	    However, if I moved the MFENCE + NOP t othe end of the routine,
	    with no other changes (so code offsets remain the same except
	    for the slight shift within fill_sons_in_loop() itself),
	    the bug stopped occuring.

		(NOTE: the 'mfence' may not be needed.  Just adding the 'nop'
		 seems to workaround the bug).

    * So, as you can see, I could not determine whether it was the %rsp that
      was wrong or the %rip that was wrong.  I think it is entirely possible
      for the cpu bug to cause a stale return due to the recursive call
      to fill_sons_in_loop().

      That is, if you observe the above code, the callq at location +155
      will store the address (fill_sons_in_loop+160) on the stack.  When
      that function (or other functions in fill_sons_in_loop()) returns,
      this old return pc value is left on the stack.  Thus the stack is
      littered with %rip values that are no longer in use but haven't been
      destroyed by local variable state.

      So there are two possibilities:

      (1) The %rip at the failure point is incorrect only because the cpu
	  bug caused a retq to return through one of these stale addresses.
	  Thus the bug is related to the stack pointer becoming corrupt.

      (2) The %rsp at the failure point is correct but the %rip is wrong.
	  There are known errata where a retq returns to the wrong %rip.
	  These errata are related to 32<->64 bit compatibility mode
	  transitions, but our pure 64-bit environment has none.  I wonder,
	  though, if the errata is not expansive enough and that the problem
	  can occur in a pure 64-bit environment too.

    * I was able to reproduce the issue with guard variables in
      first_dom_son() that pointed to themselves to resolve that
      the stack pages in fact contained the proper pages for the
      running program and that the data was not shifted.

    With many hours of additional debugging I was able to produce a test case
    where repeated runs of cc1 would fail within 60 seconds, which made
    debugging a whole lot easier.

    * ptrace()ing the program using the debug registers anywhere near
      the failure points resulted in the failure not occuring.  No failure.
      Very frustrating.

    * Via ptrace() I was able to remove most OS considerations by pre-faulting
      all required stack pages and all program text (though not malloc'd
      space).

    * I went through all the AMD as of the errata I could find online,
      which was circa 2009.  The cpu's involved in the tests which had
      problems are:

      CPU: AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 6168 (1900.01-MHz K8-class CPU)
	   Origin = "AuthenticAMD"  Id = 0x100f91  Stepping = 1
      Features=0x178bfbff<FPU,VME,DE,PSE,TSC,MSR,PAE,MCE,CX8,APIC,SEP,
			  MTRR,PGE,MCA,CMOV,PAT,PSE36,CLFLUSH,MMX,FXSR,
			  SSE,SSE2,HTT>
      Features2=0x802009<SSE3,MON,CX16,POPCNT>
      AMD Features=0xee500800<SYSCALL,NX,MMX+,FFXSR,Page1GB,RDTSCP,
			      LM,3DNow!+,3DNow!>
      AMD Features2=0x837ff<LAHF,CMP,SVM,ExtAPIC,CR8,ABM,SSE4A,MAS,
			      Prefetch,OSVW,IBS,SKINIT,WDT,NodeId>

      And also:

      CPU: AMD Phenom(tm) II X4 820 Processor (2799.92-MHz K8-class CPU)
	   Origin = "AuthenticAMD"  Id = 0x100f42  Stepping = 2
      Features=0x178bfbff<FPU,VME,DE,PSE,TSC,MSR,PAE,MCE,CX8,APIC,SEP,
			  MTRR,PGE,MCA,CMOV,PAT,PSE36,CLFLUSH,MMX,FXSR,
			  SSE,SSE2,HTT>
      Features2=0x802009<SSE3,MON,CX16,POPCNT>
      AMD Features=0xee500800<SYSCALL,NX,MMX+,FFXSR,Page1GB,RDTSCP,
			      LM,3DNow!+,3DNow!>
      AMD Features2=0x37ff<LAHF,CMP,SVM,ExtAPIC,CR8,ABM,SSE4A,MAS,
			      Prefetch,OSVW,IBS,SKINIT,WDT>

      Again, I will note that this issue does not appear to occur on our
      Intel cpus.

    * Locking the process to a single cpu did not solve the problem.

    * Once I was able to get a reproducable case running the same cc1 over
      and over again (only some runs would fail, not all)... once I was able
      to do this I noted that the register state as-of the failure seemed
      consistent for all instances of the failure.  In otherwords, something
      very specific is breaking while cc1 is running, and nothing else.

      The failure did not occur on every run of cc1 (usually at least
      once out of every 4-20 runs), but every time it DID occur the failure
      conditions appeared to be the same.

    * No other program has ever failed this way.  Only cc1, and it always
      seemed to be related to fill_sons_in_loop().

    What is notable about fill_sons_in_loop() is that it is executed as
    part of a very deep tree recursion in CC1.  This recursion is mixed
    in with a few other functions which use different stack frame sizes.
    The red-zone is in play but exhaustive testing and the fact that cc1
    takes no signals during the test remove stack smashing from signals
    as a vector for the issue.

    In otherwords, these particular routines exercise the cpu hardware
    through all sorts of cases... it is deep enough to blow out the
    hardware Return Address Stack.  It is mixed enough with other code
    to potentially create major write-combining effects due to local stack
    variables in prior calls and retirement edge cases.

    There are many AMD erratum related to write combining, cache effects,
    and the return address stack (RAS).

    * I programmed all the related MSRs based on the erratum I could
      find.  It had no effect either way, none, individually, or all
      together.

	- Errata 63 - disable the TLB flush filter

	- Errata 69 - Multiprocessor Coherency Problem with Hardware
		      Prefetch Mechanism.

	- Errata 81 - Cache Coherency Problem with Hardware Prefetching
		      and Streaming Stores.

	- Errata 86 - DRAM Data Masking Feature Can Cause ECC Failures

	- Errata 94 - Sequential Prefetch Feature May Cause Incorrect
		      Processor Operation.

	- Errata 97  (checked that movnt* was no longer used anywhere)

	- Errata 101 (made sure the dram scrubber was off)

	- Errata 113 - Enhanced Write-Combing Feature Causes System
		       Hang.

	- Errata 135/136 (checked that no prefix was used for invlpg's)

	- Misc MOVS/CMPS/STOS/CLD/STD related REP issues (e.g. like
	  errata 109).  Ran a kernel and userland which removed nearly
	  all such except for the few MOVS sequences gcc creates for
	  structural copies (which I couldn't readily figure out how
	  to remove).  No effect.

	And so on.

    * Some of these erratum imply that a 32<->64 bit mode transition is
      required.  Our cc1 and OS of course is running in pure 64 bit mode.
      I do not trust that a transition is, in fact, required for the erratum
      involved.

	- Errata 95 RET Instruction May Return To Incorrect EIP
	  (involves bugs for the Return Address Stack (RAS)).

	  Possible cause if we ignore the 32<->64 bit mode transition
	  requirement in the errata.

	- Errata 82 Certain Faults On Far Transfer Instructions In
	  64-Bit Mode Save Incorrect RIP.

	  Unlikely cause as one test case found that no exception,
	  fault, or interrupt occured for 8ms prior to the failure.
	  (unless a SYSCALL/SYSRET is responsible, which is also
	  possible but unlikely).

				RESOLUTION OF THE BUG

    * The bug still occurs if I place the MFENCE+NOP at the beginning
      of the function.

    * Placing the MFENCE+NOP at the end of the function causes the
      bug to stop occuring.

      The bug disappears completely in that case with testing over
      2 days.

    * Placing just a NOP at the end of the function causes the
      bug to stop occuring.  As of this writing this is still undergoing
      longer tests.

An update that fixes 11 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 Service Pack 4 LTSS Xen
hypervisor and toolset have been updated to fix various
security issues.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\* XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\* XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\* XSA-73: CVE-2013-4494: Xen before 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and
4.3.x does not take the page\_alloc\_lock and
grant\_table.lock in the same order, which allows local
guest administrators with access to multiple vcpus to cause
a denial of service (host deadlock) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#848657)
\* XSA-67: CVE-2013-4368: The outs instruction emulation
in Xen 3.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and earlier, when using FS: or
GS: segment override, uses an uninitialized variable as a
segment base, which allows local 64-bit PV guests to obtain
sensitive information (hypervisor stack content) via
unspecified vectors related to stale data in a segment
register. (bnc#842511)
\* XSA-63: CVE-2013-4355: Xen 4.3.x and earlier does not
properly handle certain errors, which allows local HVM
guests to obtain hypervisor stack memory via a (1) port or
(2) memory mapped I/O write or (3) other unspecified
operations related to addresses without associated memory.
(bnc#840592)
\* XSA-55: CVE-2013-2196: Multiple unspecified
vulnerabilities in the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and
earlier allow local guest administrators with certain
permissions to have an unspecified impact via a crafted
kernel, related to "other problems" that are not
CVE-2013-2194 or CVE-2013-2195. (bnc#823011)
\* XSA-55: CVE-2013-2195: The Elf parser (libelf) in Xen
4.2.x and earlier allow local guest administrators with
certain permissions to have an unspecified impact via a
crafted kernel, related to "pointer dereferences" involving
unexpected calculations. (bnc#823011)
\* XSA-55: CVE-2013-2194: Multiple integer overflows in
the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and earlier allow
local guest administrators with certain permissions to have
an unspecified impact via a crafted kernel. (bnc#823011)
\* XSA-47: CVE-2013-1920: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier,
when the hypervisor is running "under memory pressure" and
the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong
ordering of operations when extending the per-domain event
channel tracking table, which causes a use-after-free and
allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events and
gain privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#813677)
\* XSA-44: CVE-2013-1917: Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when
running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear the NT
flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which
allows PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault, which is not
properly handled by another IRET instruction. (bnc#813673)
\* XSA-25: CVE-2012-4544: The PV domain builder in Xen
4.2 and earlier does not validate the size of the kernel or
ramdisk (1) before or (2) after decompression, which allows
local guest administrators to cause a denial of service
(domain 0 memory consumption) via a crafted (a) kernel or
(b) ramdisk. (bnc#787163)

An update that solves 6 vulnerabilities and has 28 fixes is
now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 3 kernel was
updated to fix various bugs and security issues.
------------------------------------------------------------
------------ WARNING: If you are running KVM with PCI
pass-through on a system with one of the following Intel
chipsets: 5500 (revision 0x13), 5520 (revision 0x13) or
X58 (revisions 0x12, 0x13, 0x22), please make sure to read
the following support document before installing this
update:
<https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7014344>
<[https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7014344>](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7014344%3E) . You
will have to update your KVM setup to no longer make use
of PCI pass-through before rebooting to the updated
kernel.
------------------------------------------------------------
------------
The following security bugs were fixed:
\*
CVE-2013-4470: The Linux kernel before 3.12, when UDP
Fragmentation Offload (UFO) is enabled, does not properly
initialize certain data structures, which allows local
users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted
application that uses the UDP\_CORK option in a setsockopt
system call and sends both short and long packets, related
to the ip\_ufo\_append\_data function in net/ipv4/ip\_output.c
and the ip6\_ufo\_append\_data function in
net/ipv6/ip6\_output.c. (bnc#847672)
\*
CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h through
0Fh processors does not properly handle the interaction
between locked instructions and write-combined memory
types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#852967)
\*
CVE-2013-7263: The Linux kernel before 3.12.4 updates
certain length values before ensuring that associated data
structures have been initialized, which allows local users
to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via a (1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or (3) recvmsg system
call, related to net/ipv4/ping.c, net/ipv4/raw.c,
net/ipv4/udp.c, net/ipv6/raw.c, and net/ipv6/udp.c.
(bnc#857643)
\*
CVE-2013-7264: The l2tp\_ip\_recvmsg function in
net/l2tp/l2tp\_ip.c in the Linux kernel before 3.12.4
updates a certain length value before ensuring that an
associated data structure has been initialized, which
allows local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel stack memory via a (1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or
(3) recvmsg system call. (bnc#857643)
\*
CVE-2013-7265: The pn\_recvmsg function in
net/phonet/datagram.c in the Linux kernel before 3.12.4
updates a certain length value before ensuring that an
associated data structure has been initialized, which
allows local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel stack memory via a (1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or
(3) recvmsg system call. (bnc#857643)
\*
CVE-2014-0069: The cifs\_iovec\_write function in
fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not
properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer
than the requested number of bytes, which allows local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory,
cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system
crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system
call with a crafted pointer. (bnc#864025)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1035875#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-11-28 17:35:49 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the networking support(CONFIG_NET), is vulnerable to a memory leakage flaw. It occurs while doing the recvmsg(2), recvfrom(2), recvmmsg(2) socket calls.  A user/program could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.

An update that solves 12 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 3 Xen
hypervisor and toolset has been updated to 4.2.4 to fix
various bugs and security issues:
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-60: CVE-2013-2212: The vmx\_set\_uc\_mode function
in Xen 3.3 through 4.3, when disabling chaches, allows
local HVM guests with access to memory mapped I/O regions
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly
hypervisor or guest kernel panic) via a crafted GFN range.
(bnc#831120)
\*
XSA-80: CVE-2013-6400: Xen 4.2.x and 4.3.x, when
using Intel VT-d and a PCI device has been assigned, does
not clear the flag that suppresses IOMMU TLB flushes when
unspecified errors occur, which causes the TLB entries to
not be flushed and allows local guest administrators to
cause a denial of service (host crash) or gain privileges
via unspecified vectors. (bnc#853048)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\*
XSA-83: CVE-2014-1642: The IRQ setup in Xen 4.2.x and
4.3.x, when using device passthrough and configured to
support a large number of CPUs, frees certain memory that
may still be intended for use, which allows local guest
administrators to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption and hypervisor crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via vectors related to an out-of-memory
error that triggers a (1) use-after-free or (2) double
free. (bnc#860092)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1891: The FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL,
FLASK\_USER and FLASK\_CONTEXT\_TO\_SID suboperations of the
flask hypercall are vulnerable to an integer overflow on
the input size. The hypercalls attempt to allocate a buffer
which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore
vulnerable to integer overflow and an attempt to allocate
then access a zero byte buffer. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1892 CVE-2014-1893: Xen 3.3 through
4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a
different overflow issue on FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL and expose
unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests.
(bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1894: Xen 3.2 (and presumably
earlier) exhibit both problems with the overflow issue
being present for more than just the suboperations listed
above. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-85: CVE-2014-1895: The FLASK\_AVC\_CACHESTAT
hypercall, which provides access to per-cpu statistics on
the Flask security policy, incorrectly validates the CPU
for which statistics are being requested. (bnc#860165)
\*
XSA-86: CVE-2014-1896: libvchan (a library for
inter-domain communication) does not correctly handle
unusual or malicious contents in the xenstore ring. A
malicious guest can exploit this to cause a libvchan-using
facility to read or write past the end of the ring.
(bnc#860300)
\*
XSA-87: CVE-2014-1666: The do\_physdev\_op function in
Xen 4.1.5, 4.1.6.1, 4.2.2 through 4.2.3, and 4.3.x does not
properly restrict access to the (1) PHYSDEVOP\_prepare\_msix
and (2) PHYSDEVOP\_release\_msix operations, which allows
local PV guests to cause a denial of service (host or guest
malfunction) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#860302)
\*
XSA-88: CVE-2014-1950: Use-after-free vulnerability
in the xc\_cpupool\_getinfo function in Xen 4.1.x through
4.3.x, when using a multithreaded toolstack, does not
properly handle a failure by the xc\_cpumap\_alloc function,
which allows local users with access to management
functions to cause a denial of service (heap corruption)
and possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#861256)
Also the following non-security bugs have been fixed:
\* Fixed boot problems with Xen kernel. "(XEN) setup
0000:00:18.0 for d0 failed (-19)" (bnc#858311)
\* Fixed Xen hypervisor panic on 8-blades nPar with
46-bit memory addressing. (bnc#848014)
\* Fixed Xen hypervisor panic in HP's UEFI x86\_64
platform and with xen environment, in booting stage.
(bnc#833251)
\* xend/pvscsi: recognize also SCSI CDROM devices
(bnc#863297)
\* pygrub: Support (/dev/xvda) style disk specifications

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 47 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 1 LTSS Xen
hypervisor and toolset have been updated to fix various
security issues and some bugs.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1894: Xen 3.2 (and presumably
earlier) exhibit both problems with the overflow issue
being present for more than just the suboperations listed
above. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1892 CVE-2014-1893: Xen 3.3 through
4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a
different overflow issue on FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL and expose
unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests.
(bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1891: The FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL,
FLASK\_USER and FLASK\_CONTEXT\_TO\_SID suboperations of the
flask hypercall are vulnerable to an integer overflow on
the input size. The hypercalls attempt to allocate a buffer
which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore
vulnerable to integer overflow and an attempt to allocate
then access a zero byte buffer. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\*
XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\*
XSA-74: CVE-2013-4553: The XEN\_DOMCTL\_getmemlist
hypercall in Xen 3.4.x through 4.3.x (possibly 4.3.1) does
not always obtain the page\_alloc\_lock and mm\_rwlock in the
same order, which allows local guest administrators to
cause a denial of service (host deadlock). (bnc#849667)
\*
XSA-73: CVE-2013-4494: Xen before 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and
4.3.x does not take the page\_alloc\_lock and
grant\_table.lock in the same order, which allows local
guest administrators with access to multiple vcpus to cause
a denial of service (host deadlock) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#848657)
\*
XSA-67: CVE-2013-4368: The outs instruction emulation
in Xen 3.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and earlier, when using FS: or
GS: segment override, uses an uninitialized variable as a
segment base, which allows local 64-bit PV guests to obtain
sensitive information (hypervisor stack content) via
unspecified vectors related to stale data in a segment
register. (bnc#842511)
\*
XSA-66: CVE-2013-4361: The fbld instruction emulation
in Xen 3.3.x through 4.3.x does not use the correct
variable for the source effective address, which allows
local HVM guests to obtain hypervisor stack information by
reading the values used by the instruction. (bnc#841766)
\*
XSA-63: CVE-2013-4355: Xen 4.3.x and earlier does not
properly handle certain errors, which allows local HVM
guests to obtain hypervisor stack memory via a (1) port or
(2) memory mapped I/O write or (3) other unspecified
operations related to addresses without associated memory.
(bnc#840592)
\*
XSA-62: CVE-2013-1442: Xen 4.0 through 4.3.x, when
using AVX or LWP capable CPUs, does not properly clear
previous data from registers when using an XSAVE or XRSTOR
to extend the state components of a saved or restored vCPU
after touching other restored extended registers, which
allows local guest OSes to obtain sensitive information by
reading the registers. (bnc#839596)
\*
XSA-61: CVE-2013-4329: The xenlight library (libxl)
in Xen 4.0.x through 4.2.x, when IOMMU is disabled,
provides access to a busmastering-capable PCI passthrough
device before the IOMMU setup is complete, which allows
local HVM guest domains to gain privileges or cause a
denial of service via a DMA instruction. (bnc#839618)
\*
XSA-60: CVE-2013-2212: The vmx\_set\_uc\_mode function
in Xen 3.3 through 4.3, when disabling chaches, allows
local HVM guests with access to memory mapped I/O regions
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly
hypervisor or guest kernel panic) via a crafted GFN range.
(bnc#831120)
\*
XSA-58: CVE-2013-1918: Certain page table
manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier
are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause
a denial of service via vectors related to "deep page table
traversal." (bnc#826882)
\*
XSA-58: CVE-2013-1432: Xen 4.1.x and 4.2.x, when the
XSA-45 patch is in place, does not properly maintain
references on pages stored for deferred cleanup, which
allows local PV guest kernels to cause a denial of service
(premature page free and hypervisor crash) or possible gain
privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#826882)
\*
XSA-57: CVE-2013-2211: The libxenlight (libxl)
toolstack library in Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x uses weak
permissions for xenstore keys for paravirtualised and
emulated serial console devices, which allows local guest
administrators to modify the xenstore value via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#823608)
\*
XSA-56: CVE-2013-2072: Buffer overflow in the Python
bindings for the xc\_vcpu\_setaffinity call in Xen 4.0.x,
4.1.x, and 4.2.x allows local administrators with
permissions to configure VCPU affinity to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption and xend toolstack crash) and
possibly gain privileges via a crafted cpumap. (bnc#819416)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2196: Multiple unspecified
vulnerabilities in the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and
earlier allow local guest administrators with certain
permissions to have an unspecified impact via a crafted
kernel, related to "other problems" that are not
CVE-2013-2194 or CVE-2013-2195. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2195: The Elf parser (libelf) in Xen
4.2.x and earlier allow local guest administrators with
certain permissions to have an unspecified impact via a
crafted kernel, related to "pointer dereferences" involving
unexpected calculations. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2194: Multiple integer overflows in
the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and earlier allow
local guest administrators with certain permissions to have
an unspecified impact via a crafted kernel. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-53: CVE-2013-2077: Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x
does not properly restrict the contents of a XRSTOR, which
allows local PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(unhandled exception and hypervisor crash) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#820919)
\*
XSA-52: CVE-2013-2076: Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x,
when running on AMD64 processors, only save/restore the
FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an
exception is pending, which allows one domain to determine
portions of the state of floating point instructions of
other domains, which can be leveraged to obtain sensitive
information such as cryptographic keys, a similar
vulnerability to CVE-2006-1056. NOTE: this is the
documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is
inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant
fashion that was not addressed by the kernels. (bnc#820917)
\*
XSA-50: CVE-2013-1964: Xen 4.0.x and 4.1.x
incorrectly releases a grant reference when releasing a
non-v1, non-transitive grant, which allows local guest
administrators to cause a denial of service (host crash),
obtain sensitive information, or possible have other
impacts via unspecified vectors. (bnc#816156)
\*
XSA-49: CVE-2013-1952: Xen 4.x, when using Intel VT-d
for a bus mastering capable PCI device, does not properly
check the source when accessing a bridge device's interrupt
remapping table entries for MSI interrupts, which allows
local guest domains to cause a denial of service (interrupt
injection) via unspecified vectors. (bnc#816163)
\*
XSA-47: CVE-2013-1920: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier,
when the hypervisor is running "under memory pressure" and
the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong
ordering of operations when extending the per-domain event
channel tracking table, which causes a use-after-free and
allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events and
gain privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#813677)
\*
XSA-46: CVE-2013-1919: Xen 4.2.x and 4.1.x does not
properly restrict access to IRQs, which allows local stub
domain clients to gain access to IRQs and cause a denial of
service via vectors related to "passed-through IRQs or PCI
devices." (bnc#813675)
\*
XSA-45: CVE-2013-1918: Certain page table
manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier
are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause
a denial of service via vectors related to "deep page table
traversal." (bnc#816159)
\*
XSA-44: CVE-2013-1917: Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when
running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear the NT
flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which
allows PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault, which is not
properly handled by another IRET instruction. (bnc#813673)
\*
XSA-41: CVE-2012-6075: Buffer overflow in the
e1000\_receive function in the e1000 device driver
(hw/e1000.c) in QEMU 1.3.0-rc2 and other versions, when the
SBP and LPE flags are disabled, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary guest code via a large packet.
(bnc#797523)
\*
XSA-37: CVE-2013-0154: The get\_page\_type function in
xen/arch/x86/mm.c in Xen 4.2, when debugging is enabled,
allows local PV or HVM guest administrators to cause a
denial of service (assertion failure and hypervisor crash)
via unspecified vectors related to a hypercall. (bnc#797031)
\*
XSA-36: CVE-2013-0153: The AMD IOMMU support in Xen
4.2.x, 4.1.x, 3.3, and other versions, when using AMD-Vi
for PCI passthrough, uses the same interrupt remapping
table for the host and all guests, which allows guests to
cause a denial of service by injecting an interrupt into
other guests. (bnc#800275)
\*
XSA-33: CVE-2012-5634: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and 4.0,
when using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough, does not
properly configure VT-d when supporting a device that is
behind a legacy PCI Bridge, which allows local guests to
cause a denial of service to other guests by injecting an
interrupt. (bnc#794316)
\*
XSA-31: CVE-2012-5515: The (1)
XENMEM\_decrease\_reservation, (2) XENMEM\_populate\_physmap,
and (3) XENMEM\_exchange hypercalls in Xen 4.2 and earlier
allow local guest administrators to cause a denial of
service (long loop and hang) via a crafted extent\_order
value. (bnc#789950)
\*
XSA-30: CVE-2012-5514: The
guest\_physmap\_mark\_populate\_on\_demand function in Xen 4.2
and earlier does not properly unlock the subject GFNs when
checking if they are in use, which allows local guest HVM
administrators to cause a denial of service (hang) via
unspecified vectors. (bnc#789948)
\*
XSA-29: CVE-2012-5513: The XENMEM\_exchange handler in
Xen 4.2 and earlier does not properly check the memory
address, which allows local PV guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified vectors that overwrite memory in
the hypervisor reserved range. (bnc#789951)
\*
XSA-27: CVE-2012-6333: Multiple HVM control
operations in Xen 3.4 through 4.2 allow local HVM guest OS
administrators to cause a denial of service (physical CPU
consumption) via a large input. (bnc#789944)
\*
XSA-27: CVE-2012-5511: Stack-based buffer overflow in
the dirty video RAM tracking functionality in Xen 3.4
through 4.1 allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a large bitmap image.
(bnc#789944)
\*
XSA-26: CVE-2012-5510: Xen 4.x, when downgrading the
grant table version, does not properly remove the status
page from the tracking list when freeing the page, which
allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of
service (hypervisor crash) via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#789945)
\*
XSA-25: CVE-2012-4544: The PV domain builder in Xen
4.2 and earlier does not validate the size of the kernel or
ramdisk (1) before or (2) after decompression, which allows
local guest administrators to cause a denial of service
(domain 0 memory consumption) via a crafted (a) kernel or
(b) ramdisk. (bnc#787163)
\*
XSA-24: CVE-2012-4539: Xen 4.0 through 4.2, when
running 32-bit x86 PV guests on 64-bit hypervisors, allows
local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop and hang or crash) via invalid arguments to
GNTTABOP\_get\_status\_frames, aka "Grant table hypercall
infinite loop DoS vulnerability." (bnc#786520)
\*
XSA-23: CVE-2012-4538: The HVMOP\_pagetable\_dying
hypercall in Xen 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 does not properly check
the pagetable state when running on shadow pagetables,
which allows a local HVM guest OS to cause a denial of
service (hypervisor crash) via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#786519)
\*
XSA-22: CVE-2012-4537: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and
possibly earlier versions, does not properly synchronize
the p2m and m2p tables when the set\_p2m\_entry function
fails, which allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (memory consumption and assertion
failure), aka "Memory mapping failure DoS vulnerability."
(bnc#786517)
\*
XSA-20: CVE-2012-4535: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and

An update that fixes 15 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 3 LTSS Xen
hypervisor and toolset have been updated to fix various
security issues:
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-20: CVE-2012-4535: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and
possibly earlier versions, allows local guest OS
administrators to cause a denial of service (Xen infinite
loop and physical CPU consumption) by setting a VCPU with
an "inappropriate deadline". (bnc#786516)
\*
XSA-22: CVE-2012-4537: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and
possibly earlier versions, does not properly synchronize
the p2m and m2p tables when the set\_p2m\_entry function
fails, which allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (memory consumption and assertion
failure), aka "Memory mapping failure DoS vulnerability".
(bnc#786517)
\*
XSA-25: CVE-2012-4544: The PV domain builder in Xen
4.2 and earlier does not validate the size of the kernel or
ramdisk (1) before or (2) after decompression, which allows
local guest administrators to cause a denial of service
(domain 0 memory consumption) via a crafted (a) kernel or
(b) ramdisk. (bnc#787163)
\*
XSA-29: CVE-2012-5513: The XENMEM\_exchange handler in
Xen 4.2 and earlier does not properly check the memory
address, which allows local PV guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified vectors that overwrite memory in
the hypervisor reserved range. (bnc#789951)
\*
XSA-31: CVE-2012-5515: The (1)
XENMEM\_decrease\_reservation, (2) XENMEM\_populate\_physmap,
and (3) XENMEM\_exchange hypercalls in Xen 4.2 and earlier
allow local guest administrators to cause a denial of
service (long loop and hang) via a crafted extent\_order
value. (bnc#789950)
\*
XSA-44: CVE-2013-1917: Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when
running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear the NT
flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which
allows PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault, which is not
properly handled by another IRET instruction. (bnc#813673)
\*
XSA-47: CVE-2013-1920: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier,
when the hypervisor is running "under memory pressure" and
the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong
ordering of operations when extending the per-domain event
channel tracking table, which causes a use-after-free and
allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events and
gain privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#813677)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2196: Multiple unspecified
vulnerabilities in the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and
earlier allow local guest administrators with certain
permissions to have an unspecified impact via a crafted
kernel, related to "other problems" that are not
CVE-2013-2194 or CVE-2013-2195. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2195: The Elf parser (libelf) in Xen
4.2.x and earlier allow local guest administrators with
certain permissions to have an unspecified impact via a
crafted kernel, related to "pointer dereferences" involving
unexpected calculations. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2194: Multiple integer overflows in
the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and earlier allow
local guest administrators with certain permissions to have
an unspecified impact via a crafted kernel. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-63: CVE-2013-4355: Xen 4.3.x and earlier does not
properly handle certain errors, which allows local HVM
guests to obtain hypervisor stack memory via a (1) port or
(2) memory mapped I/O write or (3) other unspecified
operations related to addresses without associated memory.
(bnc#840592)
\*
XSA-67: CVE-2013-4368: The outs instruction emulation
in Xen 3.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and earlier, when using FS: or
GS: segment override, uses an uninitialized variable as a
segment base, which allows local 64-bit PV guests to obtain
sensitive information (hypervisor stack content) via
unspecified vectors related to stale data in a segment
register. (bnc#842511)
\*
XSA-73: CVE-2013-4494: Xen before 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and
4.3.x does not take the page\_alloc\_lock and
grant\_table.lock in the same order, which allows local
guest administrators with access to multiple vcpus to cause
a denial of service (host deadlock) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#848657)
\*
XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0285)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the qeth\_snmp\_command()

function in the Linux kernel's QETH network device driver implementation
handled SNMP IOCTL requests with an out-of-bounds length. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-6381, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the ipc\_rcu\_putref() function in the Linux

kernel's IPC implementation handled reference counter decrementing.
A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger an Out of Memory
(OOM) condition and, potentially, crash the system. (CVE-2013-4483,
Moderate)

* It was found that the Xen hypervisor implementation did not correctly

check privileges of hypercall attempts made by HVM guests, allowing
hypercalls to be invoked from protection rings 1 and 2 in addition to ring
0. A local attacker in an HVM guest able to execute code on privilege
levels 1 and 2 could potentially use this flaw to further escalate their
privileges in that guest. Note: Xen HVM guests running unmodified versions
of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Microsoft Windows are not affected by this
issue because they are known to only use protection rings 0 (kernel) and 3
(userspace). (CVE-2013-4554, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Adaptec RAID controller

(aacraid) checked permissions of compat IOCTLs. A local attacker could use
this flaw to bypass intended security restrictions. (CVE-2013-6383,
Moderate)

* It was found that, under specific circumstances, a combination of write

operations to write-combined memory and locked CPU instructions may cause a
core hang on certain AMD CPUs (for more information, refer to AMD CPU
erratum 793 linked in the References section). A privileged user in a guest
running under the Xen hypervisor could use this flaw to cause a denial of
service on the host system. This update adds a workaround to the Xen
hypervisor implementation, which mitigates the AMD CPU issue. Note: this
issue only affects AMD Family 16h Models 00h-0Fh Processors. Non-AMD CPUs
are not vulnerable. (CVE-2013-6885, Moderate)

* It was found that certain protocol handlers in the Linux kernel's

networking implementation could set the addr\_len value without initializing
the associated data structure. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to leak kernel stack memory to user space using the recvmsg, recvfrom,
and recvmmsg system calls. (CVE-2013-7263, Low)

* A flaw was found in the way the get\_dumpable() function return value was

interpreted in the ptrace subsystem of the Linux kernel. When
'fs.suid\_dumpable' was set to 2, a local, unprivileged local user could
use this flaw to bypass intended ptrace restrictions and obtain
potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-2929, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Vladimir Davydov of Parallels for reporting
CVE-2013-4483 and the Xen project for reporting CVE-2013-4554 and
CVE-2013-6885. Upstream acknowledges Jan Beulich as the original reporter
of CVE-2013-4554 and CVE-2013-6885.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds one enhancement.
Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
enhancement. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6885 CVE-2014-8133 CVE-2014-9419 CVE-2014-9529
                 CVE-2014-9584

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2013-6885

    It was discovered that under specific circumstances, a combination
    of write operations to write-combined memory and locked CPU
    instructions may cause a core hang on AMD 16h 00h through 0Fh
    processors. A local user can use this flaw to mount a denial of
    service (system hang) via a crafted application.

    For more information please refer to the AMD CPU erratum 793 in
    <http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/51810_16h_00h-0Fh_Rev_Guide.pdf>

CVE-2014-8133

    It was found that the espfix funcionality can be bypassed by
    installing a 16-bit RW data segment into GDT instead of LDT (which
    espfix checks for) and using it for stack. A local unprivileged user
    could potentially use this flaw to leak kernel stack addresses and
    thus allowing to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

CVE-2014-9419

    It was found that on Linux kernels compiled with the 32 bit
    interfaces (CONFIG_X86_32) a malicious user program can do a
    partial ASLR bypass through TLS base addresses leak when attacking
    other programs.

CVE-2014-9529

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel is affected by a race
    condition flaw when doing key garbage collection, allowing local
    users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic).

CVE-2014-9584

    It was found that the Linux kernel does not validate a length value
    in the Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field, which allows
    local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a
    crafted iso9660 image.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.65-1+deb7u1. Additionally this update fixes a suspend/resume
regression introduced with 3.2.65.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

  793 Specific Combination of Writes to Write Combined Memory
  Types and Locked Instructions May Cause Core Hang

  Under a highly specific and detailed set of internal timing
  conditions, a locked instruction may trigger a timing sequence whereby
  the write to a write combined memory type is not flushed, causing the
  locked instruction to stall indefinitely.

  Potential Effect on System
  Processor core hang.

  Suggested Workaround
  BIOS should set MSRC001_1020[15] = 1b.

  No fix planned

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An update that solves 10 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 2 LTSS Xen
hypervisor and toolset has been updated to fix various
security issues and several bugs.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-88: CVE-2014-1950: Use-after-free vulnerability
in the xc\_cpupool\_getinfo function in Xen 4.1.x through
4.3.x, when using a multithreaded toolstack, does not
properly handle a failure by the xc\_cpumap\_alloc function,
which allows local users with access to management
functions to cause a denial of service (heap corruption)
and possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#861256)
\*
XSA-87: CVE-2014-1666: The do\_physdev\_op function in
Xen 4.1.5, 4.1.6.1, 4.2.2 through 4.2.3, and 4.3.x does not
properly restrict access to the (1) PHYSDEVOP\_prepare\_msix
and (2) PHYSDEVOP\_release\_msix operations, which allows
local PV guests to cause a denial of service (host or guest
malfunction) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#860302)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1894: Xen 3.2 (and presumably
earlier) exhibit both problems with the overflow issue
being present for more than just the suboperations listed
above. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1892 CVE-2014-1893: Xen 3.3 through
4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a
different overflow issue on FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL and expose
unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests.
(bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1891: The FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL,
FLASK\_USER and FLASK\_CONTEXT\_TO\_SID suboperations of the
flask hypercall are vulnerable to an integer overflow on
the input size. The hypercalls attempt to allocate a buffer
which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore
vulnerable to integer overflow and an attempt to allocate
then access a zero byte buffer. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\*
XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\*
XSA-74: CVE-2013-4553: The XEN\_DOMCTL\_getmemlist
hypercall in Xen 3.4.x through 4.3.x (possibly 4.3.1) does
not always obtain the page\_alloc\_lock and mm\_rwlock in the
same order, which allows local guest administrators to
cause a denial of service (host deadlock). (bnc#849667)
\*
XSA-60: CVE-2013-2212: The vmx\_set\_uc\_mode function
in Xen 3.3 through 4.3, when disabling chaches, allows
local HVM guests with access to memory mapped I/O regions
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly
hypervisor or guest kernel panic) via a crafted GFN range.
(bnc#831120)
Also the following non-security bugs have been fixed:
\* Boot Failure with xen kernel in UEFI mode with error
"No memory for trampoline" (bnc#833483)
\* Fixed Xen hypervisor panic on 8-blades nPar with
46-bit memory addressing. (bnc#848014)
\* In HP's UEFI x86\_64 platform and sles11sp3 with xen
environment, dom0 will soft lockup on multiple blades nPar.
(bnc#842417)
\* Soft lockup with PCI passthrough and many VCPUs
(bnc#846849)

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 82 (CVE-2013-6885) - Guest triggerable AMD
 CPU erratum may cause host hang

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-6885 / XSA-82
                              version 3

          Guest triggerable AMD CPU erratum may cause host hang

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Early public release.

This issue was predisclosed under embargo by the Xen Project Security
team, on the 27th of November.  We treated the issue as not publicly
known because it was not evident from the public sources that this
erratum constitutes a vulnerability (particularly, that it was a
vulnerability in relation to some Xen configurations).

Since then, the fact that this CPU erratum is likely to constitute a
security problem has been publicly disclosed, on the oss-security
mailing list.

Under the circumstances, and in accordance with the Xen Project
security vulnerability policy, it has been decided that it is no
longer appropriate to retain the embargo, as the key facts are now in
the open.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

AMD CPU erratum 793 "Specific Combination of Writes to Write Combined
Memory Types and Locked Instructions May Cause Core Hang" describes a
situation under which a CPU core may hang.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can mount a denial of service attack
affecting the whole system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

The vulnerability is applicable only to family 16h model 00h-0fh AMD
CPUs.

Such CPUs running Xen versions 3.3 onwards are vulnerable.  We have
not checked earlier versions of Xen.

HVM guests can always exploit the vulnerability if it is present.
PV guests can exploit the vulnerability only if they have been granted
access to physical device(s).

Non-AMD CPUs are not vulnerable.

CREDITS
=======

This issue's security impact was discovered by Jan Beulich.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be avoided by neither running HVM guests, nor assigning
PCI devices to PV guests.

RESOLUTION
==========

The attached patch contains a software workaround which resolves this
issue.

Alternatively, the recommended workaround can be implemented in
firmware, so a suitable firmware update will resolve the issue.
If you require a firmware update please consult your vendor.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
