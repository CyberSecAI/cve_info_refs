        "Root cause": "A hardware issue related to specific combinations of writes to write-combined memory types and locked instructions on AMD CPUs.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "A timing sequence where a write to a write-combined memory type is not flushed causing a locked instruction to stall indefinitely.",
          "The bug is EXTREMELY sensitive to %rip and %rsp values.",
          "High reproducability repeats every 32K of offset in the stack."
        ],
        "Impact": "Segmentation fault, bus fault, or other fault related to corrupt program state, causing the compiler to report an internal compiler failure. Processor core hang.",

          "Crafted application utilizing specific write operations and locked instructions.",

          "Local user access to execute code on the vulnerable system.",
          "Ability to run code that exercises specific memory write patterns and locked CPU instructions."
        ],
		"details": "The issue is triggered during a deep tree recursion in GCC's cc1, specifically within the fill_sons_in_loop() function. The failure involves inconsistent register state, possibly caused by stale return addresses on the stack due to recursive calls, potentially related to hardware Return Address Stack. The issue is highly sensitive to stack addresses, argument length, environment variables, and other factors impacting stack layout. It is not an OS bug but a hardware issue. Inserting a NOP instruction, at the end of the vulnerable function, seems to avoid the issue."
