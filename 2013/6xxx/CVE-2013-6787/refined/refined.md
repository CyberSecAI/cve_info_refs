Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6787

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient validation of the `password0` HTTP POST parameter in the `/main/auth/profile.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89). The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive information from the database)
    - Data modification (altering or deleting data within the database)
    - Potential for further compromise of the system via database access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/main/auth/profile.php` endpoint.
- The `password0` parameter is used to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user on the vulnerable Chamilo LMS system.
- The system must be configured to store passwords without encryption (encryption method set to "none").

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit example provided demonstrates how an attacker could inject SQL to reveal the version of the MySQL server.
- The advisory indicates the vulnerability exists in Chamilo LMS version 1.9.6 and likely prior versions.
- A patch was released by the vendor on November 9, 2013, to address this issue.
