How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Overview

Various versions of mod\_pagespeed are subject to critical cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, CVE-2013-6111. This permits a hostile third party to execute JavaScript in users' browsers in context of the domain running mod\_pagespeed, which could permit theft of users' cookies or data on the site.

Because of the severity of the problem, users of affected versions are **strongly** encouraged to update **immediately**.

To be notified of further security updates subscribe to the [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/) and [mod-pagespeed-announce](https://groups.google.com/group/mod-pagespeed-announce).

Affected versions

* Versions earlier than 1.0.
* 1.0.22.7 (fixed in 1.0.22.8).
* All 1.1 versions
* 1.2.24.1 (fixed in 1.2.24.2)
* 1.3.25.1 – 1.3.25.4 (fixed in 1.3.25.5)
* 1.4.26.1 – 1.4.26.4 (fixed in 1.4.26.5)
* 1.5.27.1 – 1.5.27.3 (fixed in 1.5.27.4)
* 1.6.29.1 – 1.6.29.6 (fixed in 1.6.29.7)

## Solution

You can resolve this problem by updating to the latest version of either stable or beta channels. If for some reason you are unable to update to a new version, patched versions to resolve the vulnerability are also available for releases 1.0 as well as 1.2 through 1.6.
### Upgrading to the latest version

The easiest way to resolve the vulnerability is to update to the latest versions on whatever channel (stable or beta) are you currently using.

If you installed the .rpm package, you can update with:

```

sudo yum update
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart

```

If you installed the .deb package, you can update with:

```

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

```
It is also possible to [build from source.](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/build_mod_pagespeed_from_source)
### Updating while keeping version 1.0

On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu), you can update to the patched 1.0 version by running:

```

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mod-pagespeed-stable=1.0.22.8-r3546

```
On RPM based systems that use the `yum` command, you can update from older versions by using:
```

yum install mod-pagespeed-stable-1.0.22.8

```

Note that this command will not switch you to a lower version number (for example, it will not switch from a 1.2 version with the vulnerability to a fixed version of 1.0); it is recommended that you resolve this security vulnerability by upgrading to the patched release of whatever version you are currently using, or the latest beta or stable version.

You can also download binaries directly:

### Updating while keeping version 1.2

On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu), you can update to the patched 1.2 version by running:
```

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mod-pagespeed-stable=1.2.24.2-r3534

```
On RPM based systems that use the `yum` command, you can update from older versions by using:
```

yum install mod-pagespeed-stable-1.2.24.2

```

Note that this command will not switch you to a lower version number (for example, it will not switch from a 1.3 version with the vulnerability to a fixed version of 1.2); it is recommended that you resolve this security vulnerability by upgrading to the patched release of whatever version you are currently using, or the latest beta or stable version.

# October 2013 mod\_pagespeed Security Update.

## Overview

Various versions of mod\_pagespeed are subject to critical
cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, CVE-2013-6111. This permits a hostile
third party to execute JavaScript in users' browsers in context of the domain
running mod\_pagespeed, which could permit theft of users' cookies or data
on the site.

Because of the severity of the problem, users of affected versions are
**strongly** encouraged to update **immediately**.

To be notified of further security updates subscribe to the
[announcements mailing list](mailing-lists#announcements).
## Affected versions

* Versions earlier than 1.0.
* 1.0.22.7 (fixed in 1.0.22.8).
* All 1.1 versions
* 1.2.24.1 (fixed in 1.2.24.2)
* 1.3.25.1 – 1.3.25.4 (fixed in 1.3.25.5)
* 1.4.26.1 – 1.4.26.4 (fixed in 1.4.26.5)
* 1.5.27.1 – 1.5.27.3 (fixed in 1.5.27.4)
* 1.6.29.1 – 1.6.29.6 (fixed in 1.6.29.7)

## Solution

You can resolve this problem by updating to the latest version of either stable
or beta channels. If for some reason you are unable to update to a new version,
patched versions to resolve the vulnerability are also available for releases
1.0 as well as 1.2 through 1.6.
### Upgrading to the latest version

The easiest way to resolve the vulnerability is to update to the latest
versions on whatever channel (stable or beta) are you currently using.

If you installed the .rpm package, you can update with:
```

sudo yum update
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart

```

If you installed the .deb package, you can update with:
```

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

```
It is also possible to [build from source.](build_mod_pagespeed_from_source)
### Updating while keeping version 1.0

On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu), you can update to the patched 1.0
version by running:
```

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mod-pagespeed-stable=1.0.22.8-r3546

```
On RPM based systems that use the `yum` command, you can update
from older versions by using:
```

yum install mod-pagespeed-stable-1.0.22.8

```

Note that this command will not switch you to a lower version number
(for example, it will not switch from a 1.2 version with the vulnerability to
a fixed version of 1.0); it is recommended that you resolve this security
vulnerability by upgrading to the patched release of whatever version you are
currently using, or the latest beta or stable version.
