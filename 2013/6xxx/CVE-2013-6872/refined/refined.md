Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6872

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `managetimetracker.php` page. This lack of sanitization allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Specifically, a "double query type" SQL injection vulnerability. This means the attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** A successful exploit allows a remote authenticated attacker to extract sensitive and confidential data from the database. This could include user credentials, project information, and other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `managetimetracker.php` page.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `id` parameter within the URL is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the Collabtive application to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via a network connection.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable File:** `managetimetracker.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
- **Example Payload:**
```
and(select 1 from(select count(*),concat((select (select (SELECT distinct concat(0x7e,0x27,cast(schema_name as char),0x27,0x7e) FROM information_schema.schemata LIMIT 0,1)) from information_schema.tables limit 0,1),floor(rand(0)*2))x from information_schema.tables group by x)a) and 1=1
```
- **Example vulnerable URL:**
```
http://www.example.com/collabtive/managetimetracker.php?action=projectpdf&id=2 and(select 1 from(select count(*),concat((select (select (SELECT distinct concat(0x7e,0x27,cast(schema_name as char),0x27,0x7e) FROM information_schema.schemata LIMIT 0,1)) from information_schema.tables limit 0,1),floor(rand(0)*2))x from information_schema.tables group by x)a) and 1=1
```
- This payload leverages a double query technique and utilizes `information_schema` to extract the database schema name.

**Affected Version:**
- Collabtive version 1.1

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to Collabtive version 1.2 or later where this vulnerability is fixed.
