Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect restoration of file metadata by the TSM Backup-Archive client for TSM for Space Management files. This occurs after a specific series of actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect metadata restoration. Specifically, permissions of restored files might not be properly restored, potentially leading to a mismatch between expected and actual permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker needs to have local access to the system running the vulnerable TSM client.
- Requires a specific sequence of actions involving backup and restore to trigger the issue

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to a machine running an affected version of the TSM Backup-Archive client.
- The attacker would need to trigger the specific sequence of actions that cause the improper metadata restoration.
- Exploitation does not require any special privileges or roles, just the ability to trigger the restore process.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of the TSM Backup-Archive client across different operating systems.
