Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2013/11/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, November 12, 2013

Chrome has been updated to 31.0.1650.48 for Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome Frame.

Flash Player has been [updated](http://helpx.adobe.com/en/flash-player/release-note/fp_119_air_39_release_notes.html) to 11.9.900.152, which is included w/ this release.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [25 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M31). Below, we highlight fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or particularly interesting. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.
