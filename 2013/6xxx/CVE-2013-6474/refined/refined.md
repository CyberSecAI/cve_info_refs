Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-6474:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `pdftoopvp` filter within CUPS (Common Unix Printing System). The vulnerability was due to a missing fix related to memory handling in the `pdftoopvp` filter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in `pdftoopvp` filter.
- Incorrect memory handling

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the "lp" user. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the printing system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing a maliciously crafted PDF file using the vulnerable `pdftoopvp` filter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to submit a malicious PDF file to be processed by CUPS. This could be achieved through a variety of means, depending on the context and configuration of the printing system.
