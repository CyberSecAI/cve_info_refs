      "ID": "CVE-2013-6419",
      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The neutron metadata service did not properly restrict access to metadata based on tenant IDs when querying Nova. The neutron-metadata-agent queries neutron-server using router_id and ip_address to determine the port, then takes the device_id (nova-instance-id) on the port and passes it to Nova as X-Instance-ID. Because the device_id on a neutron port is updateable by a tenant, a malicious tenant could change the device_id to another tenant's instance_id to retrieve that instance's metadata.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Missing authorization check on port binding",
		    "Insecure direct object reference"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious tenant could retrieve metadata of another tenant, potentially leading to information disclosure.",
      "Attack vectors": "A tenant modifies the device_id on their port to match another tenant's instance_id, then makes a metadata request.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be a tenant within the OpenStack environment and know or guess another tenant's instance ID."
    }
