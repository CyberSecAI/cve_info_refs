{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of buffers in the `pepoly.dll` module when processing a malicious PE file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local attackers can overwrite registers, leading to process compromise, system compromise, or a crash of the QuickHeal software system process.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker with a low privileged system user account. The attacker needs to prepare a malicious PE file."
