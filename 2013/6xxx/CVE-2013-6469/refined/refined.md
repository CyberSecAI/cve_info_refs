Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6469:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in JBoss SOA RTgov where remote, authenticated attackers could execute arbitrary Java code.
*   This was possible through the use of MVEL expressions that could be submitted through RTgov.
*   The lack of proper input sanitization or restrictions allowed the attacker to inject and execute their malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary Java code remotely.
*   **Insecure MVEL Expression Handling:** The vulnerability lies in how RTgov processes MVEL expressions, specifically by allowing unsanitized code to be processed.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The system failed to properly validate or sanitize the input received, leading to the exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to run arbitrary code within the security context of the application server hosting the affected RTgov.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  The ability to execute arbitrary code can potentially lead to full control over the server.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers can leverage this to steal sensitive information, modify data, or disrupt services.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The compromised server can be used as a launchpad for further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Remote attackers exploit this, implying network access to the vulnerable RTgov instance.
*   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must be authenticated to the RTgov application to submit the malicious MVEL expressions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** Attackers need to be able to connect to the server where JBoss SOA RTgov is running.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate with the RTgov application.
*   **Knowledge of RTgov Interface:** The attacker should know how to submit MVEL expressions via the RTgov interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability does not affect RTgov as shipped with Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6 due to mitigation through configuration options or removal of the vulnerable interface.
*   Older upstream versions of JBoss Overlord RTGov may be affected.
*   Mitigation strategies involved Java Security Manager policies or removing the vulnerable interface.
