### Description

| [**CWE-284**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)**: Improper Access Control** - CVE-2013-6955  Synology DiskStation Manager versions 4.3-3776-3 and below allow a remote unauthenticated user to append arbitrary data to files on the system under root privileges. According to Synology:*Synology File Station in DSM employs a technique called "Slice Upload" to upload files when the file size is over 4GB [in the] Firefox browser. Since this feature is implemented in DSM4.0, all versions of DSM after DSM4.0 are subject to this vulnerability.*To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to /webman/imageSelector.cgi containing the header fields X-TYPE-NAME: SLICEUPLOAD and X-TMP-FILE with the valid path of the file to append malicious code or data. |
