- Feature Comparison for Enterprise vs Standard at: http://www.nagios.com/products/nagiosxi/whatsnew
- The upgrade from 2011 to 2012 will backup all currently installed wizards, components, and dashlets to the /tmp directory to account for custom modifications to any Nagios XI addons.
- The upgrade from 2011 to 2012 update any current wizards, components, and dashlets released by Nagios enterprise to their latest versions. This particular upgrade step will only happen one time once the full production version of 2012 is posted. This is done to allow users to safely modify components and wizards without being overwritten with each upgrade.
- The Admin->SSH Terminal access uses SSL and requires browser acceptance of the certificate the first time it is used. (Open in a new tab).
- Any new components and wizards can be removed after the upgrade if not desired
- Home dashboards will be updated to the new default home splash after the upgrade. The default home dashboard can be brought back by selecting the "Change my default home page" link at the top right of the home page.
- Nagios BPI 1.x users will have to migrate their configuration for use with Nagios BPI 2.x, since groups are now calculated differently.
- The previous version of the Core Config Manager is still available in the menu system by selecting "Legacy CCM"
