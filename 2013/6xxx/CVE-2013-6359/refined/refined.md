Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Munin's incorrect handling of certain multigraph service names. Specifically, a malicious node can exploit this by providing a multigraph service name that causes Munin to stop data collection for the entire node.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation of multigraph service names provided by monitored nodes.
- Lack of proper error handling in the Munin master when processing multigraph service data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker (a malicious node) can cause the Munin master to stop collecting data from a node. This disrupts monitoring and can hide critical issues.
- Loss of Monitoring Data: As data collection stops, historical and current monitoring data is lost.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack via Malicious Node: A compromised or malicious Munin node sends crafted data to the Munin master containing a specific multigraph service name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to Control a Munin Node: The attacker needs to control a node that is being monitored by the vulnerable Munin master.
- Knowledge of Munin Protocol: The attacker needs to craft specific data related to multigraph services, targeting the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content mentions that this vulnerability was fixed in Munin version 2.0.18 and later.
- Ubuntu and Debian security advisories confirm this CVE and its fix.
- The fix involved backporting patches from upstream to `master/lib/Munin/Master/{HTMLOld,Node}.pm`.
- This issue is related to CVE-2013-6048 which is a separate vulnerability but was fixed in the same release.

In summary, CVE-2013-6359 allows a malicious Munin node to remotely cause a denial of service on the Munin master by sending a specific crafted multigraph service name, leading to data collection stoppage for that node.
