Tests

The OX QA team has verified all bug fixes.

To avoid side effects the packages have gone through automated smoke and regression
test on both, the OX Build System and a distributed OX QA server setup.

In addition all bug fixes have been checked for potential side effects or changed
behavior. Unless explicitly stated with one of the bug entries above, we do not expect
other side effects.
