- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled resource consumption due to excessive event logging when the DNP3 driver is flooded with specially crafted IP frames containing multiple errors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The DNP3Driver.exe process does not properly handle a flood of error-containing DNP3 frames, leading to excessive event logging.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition of the DNP3 process by causing the DNP3Driver.exe to hang, slowing driver operation, and potentially leading to a DoS due to resource starvation. Note that data corruption, driver crashes, or arbitrary code execution are not results of this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation via specially crafted IP frames sent to the DNP3 driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with medium skill capable of crafting malicious DNP3 frames, and the ability to send these frames to the vulnerable DNP3 driver. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
