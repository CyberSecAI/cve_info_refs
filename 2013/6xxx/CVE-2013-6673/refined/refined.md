Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-6673:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey handle Extended Validation (EV) certificates. The code responsible for retrieving trusted EV root certificates does not properly check the trust flags set by the user, specifically ignoring if a user has explicitly removed trust for a specific root certificate.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Ignoring User Trust Settings:** The primary weakness is the failure to respect user-defined trust settings for EV root certificates. Even if a user has explicitly marked a root certificate as untrusted in the browser's certificate manager, the browser will still consider it trusted during EV certificate validation.
- **Bypass of manual untrust:** Users are unable to manually remove trust from specific authorities via the certificate manager.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Bypass of user security controls:** An attacker could potentially trick a user into trusting a malicious website, even if the user has intentionally removed trust from the root certificate authority. This could lead to phishing attacks or other forms of impersonation.
- **Loss of user control:** The user's ability to explicitly manage and control the trust of root certificates is severely undermined.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:** While not directly, the vulnerability could be used in conjunction with a MitM attack where the attacker uses a certificate chain signed by an authority a user has untrusted. Since the browser fails to check that setting, the user would not be alerted.
- **Phishing/Impersonation:** An attacker could set up a website with an EV certificate signed by a root that a user has explicitly distrusted. Due to the flaw, the user will see the EV visual indicator and assume that the site is trusted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to obtain EV certificate:** The attacker needs to obtain an Extended Validation certificate signed by a root certificate authority that a user might have explicitly distrusted.
- **Network Position (for MitM):** If exploited in conjunction with MitM attack, the attacker would need to be able to intercept and modify the user's network traffic.
- **Social Engineering (for Phishing/Impersonation):** The attacker would also need social engineering skills to entice the user to visit the attacker's website.

**Additional notes:**
- This issue specifically affects EV certificates and does not impact other types of certificates.
- The vulnerability exists because of the way the EV verification code was implemented, where it bypassed manual trust settings by directly relying on the built-in trust list.
- The issue is not considered a high severity risk in a default configuration as it would require a user to have manually changed the trust settings for a built-in root certificate. However it does have a high impact for users who do change these settings.
- This vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 26, Firefox ESR 24.2, SeaMonkey 2.23, and Thunderbird 24.2
