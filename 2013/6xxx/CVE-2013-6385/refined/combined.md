Package        : drupal7
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6385 CVE-2013-6386 CVE-2013-6387 CVE-2013-6388
                 CVE-2013-6389

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Drupal, a fully-featured
content management framework: Cross-site request forgery, insecure
pseudo random number generation, code execution, incorrect security token
validation and cross-site scripting.

In order to avoid the remote code execution vulnerability, it is
recommended to create a .htaccess file (or an equivalent configuration
directive in case you are not using Apache to serve your Drupal sites)
in each of your sites'"files" directories (both public and private, in
case you have both configured).

Please refer to the NEWS file provided with this update and the upstream
advisory at <https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-003> for further information.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.14-2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.24-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
