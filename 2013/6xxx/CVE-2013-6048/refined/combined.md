## Binary packages built by this source

[munin](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/munin):
network-wide graphing framework (grapher/gatherer)

Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of

 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still

 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.

 .

 This package contains the grapher/gatherer. You will only need one instance of

 it in your network. It will periodically poll all the nodes in your network

 it's aware of for data, which it in turn will use to create graphs and HTML

 pages, suitable for viewing with your graphical web browser of choice.

 .

 It is also able to alert you if any value is outside of a preset boundary,

 useful if you want to be alerted if a filesystem is about to grow full, for

 instance. You can do this by making Munin run an arbitrary command when you

 need to be alert it, or make use of the intrinsic Nagios support.

 .

 Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent

 RRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, you can follow a link

 from <<http://munin.projects.linpro.no/>> to a live installation.

[munin-common](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/munin-common):
network-wide graphing framework (common)

Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of

 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still

 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.

 .

 This package contains the common perl modules that are used by both munin

 and munin-node.

 .

[munin-java-plugins](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/munin-java-plugins):
network-wide graphing framework (java plugins for node)

Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of

 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still

 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.

 .

 This package contains the java based plugins that are used by munin-node to

 monitor Java Management Extensions (JMX).

[munin-node](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/munin-node):
network-wide graphing framework (node)

Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of

 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still

 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.

 .

 This package contains the daemon for the nodes being monitored. You should

 install it on all the nodes in your network. It will know how to extract all

 sorts of data from the node it runs on, and will wait for the gatherer to

 request this data for further processing.

 .

 It includes a range of plugins capable of extracting common values such as cpu

 usage, network usage, load average, and so on. Creating your own plugins which

 are capable of extracting other system-specific values is very easy, and is

 often done in a matter of minutes. You can also create plugins which relay

 information from other devices in your network that can't run Munin, such as a

 switch or a server running another operating system, by using SNMP or similar

 technology.

 .

 Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent

 RRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, you can follow a link

[munin-plugins-extra](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/munin-plugins-extra):
network-wide graphing framework (user contributed plugins for node)

Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of

 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still

 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.

 .

 This package contains unsupported plugins for the Munin node, contributed by

 various users of Munin.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2815-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Salvatore Bonaccorso

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : munin
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6048 CVE-2013-6359

Christoph Biedl discovered two denial of service vulnerabilities in
munin, a network-wide graphing framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-6048

    The Munin::Master::Node module of munin does not properly validate
    certain data a node sends. A malicious node might exploit this to
    drive the munin-html process into an infinite loop with memory
    exhaustion on the munin master.

CVE-2013-6359

    A malicious node, with a plugin enabled using "multigraph" as a
    multigraph service name, can abort data collection for the entire
    node the plugin runs on.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.6-4+deb7u2.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.18-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.18-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your munin packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Safeguard to avoid any bigger loop than 100 nested levels. It protects against
application bugs in the parsing code.

Commits by bldewolf, feiner.tom, janl, knan, ligne, mha, ssm, steve.schnepp, lupe, jorne
Summary :
\* Huge performance boost\* munin-graph is over, cgi graphing only from now on\* Enabling CGI HTML with an reworked UI\* use a binary DB to store spoolfetch timestamps (fixes growing file bug in 2.0a1)\* documentation cleanup
Enhancements :
\* Better node side timeout error message allowing things to be found out if needed\* Properly label the bgbouncer queries-per-second graph.\* Properly return undef when the SNMP client returns noSuchObject instead of setting an error.\* munin-node: Insert a reset\_timeout() call to enable the master to get in a word in edgeways after a slow plugin has executed\* munin-html: Start using fork to save some wall-clock time. Option --fork us now active and max\_html\_jobs is recognized by munin-html as the maximum number of paralell processes.\* Actually recognize max\_html\_jobs as a config parameter\* Add the publication part\* Clean up Perl warnings due to use of undefined variables in two functions in LimitsOld.pm.\* looking at the Net::SNMP doco, -username cannot be '' (it must be between 1 and 32 characters).\* The time of munin-graph is over, cgi from now on\* since pollers are now being respawned if they fall over, the shutdown-spooler signal handlers need to be removed before starting any poller up.\* Cleanup of munin-cgi-graph: - Make it log right - Make it fast (now <0.1s pr graph on reasonable hardware) - Remove $config deep copy, it is too expensive, we need to fix expand\_specials instead. - BUG: Broke --pinpoint processing\* Munin::Master::Utils: - Replace some often used REs with string matches for speed. Helped speed up munin-cgi-graph quite a bit. Introduced munin\_dumpconfig to help debug the expand\_specials issue - Introduce munin\_find\_node\_by\_fqn to do faster lookups of things to graph.\* Munin::Master::GraphOld: - Restructure a bit to avoid double loading of $config (in cooperation with munin-cgi-graph) and make it possible to pass some graphing options (--only-fqn for example) in some new places. - Propper logging the right way - NOTE: All code relating to host and service filtering and looping should be removed soonish - we're only using the FQN to find our work now.\* Replacing 'echo -n', which is implementation-defined - with printf, which is posix\* munin-update: Add local URI scheme to enable running async collector directly on the master as this may somehow enable push-to master. Closes #981, thanks to jorne\* ALWAYS dumps the RRD cmd used when an error occurs when RRD::graphing\* Add some extra HTTP Response Headers\* JMX refactoring by Joachim Sauer\* add some external tools to ease a Storable datafile\* Enabled multigraph capabilities for the munin-async-server\* Re-work filtering in linux df plugin to be much more flexible.\* Force lpstat to C locale instead of EN\_us.
Various bugfix (not exhaustive) :
\* ${graph\_period} substitution should happens in graph\_title & fieldname (closes #881, thx stavros)\* bugfix for mkpath on 5.8.8 (closes #992) -- thx Matthew Kent\* fixes #991 (munin-update constantly thinks config has changed), thx mkent\* Better checks for undefs in munin-limits (#973)\* IPMI plugin now graphs power usage as well (#954)\* Fix swap usage numbers in the sunos memory plugin (#696)\* Make exim\_mailstats plugin behave properly after initialisation (#985)\* Fixed a bug where all services in a category were colored when a service had a warning or critical state\* Clean up field names in the bonding\_err\_ plugin on linux (#962)\* Cosmetic cleanups in snmp\_\_if\_multi plugin (#1008)\* The snmp\_\_if\_multi plugin now makes proper use of 64bit counters if available (#1006)\* The linux plugin selinux\_avcstat now uses integers instead of floating points (#1005)\* freebsd/coretemp - rrd doesn't do celsius/fahrenheit\* Fix autoconf in the nfs\_client plugin for linux nodes (#1015).\* Fix issues with plugin names with - in them.\* Make linux df plugin not die when it encounters a mountpoint it can't access (#940)\* snmp\_\_df - avoid division by zero\* gets it working for net-snmp snmpd on a ubuntu 10.04 lts desktop with fuse mounts\* Fix up Solaris's if\_ plugin.\* Low max\_processes leads to hosts being skipped (closes #990) -- thx Matthew Kent\* Make the mysql\_ plugin better at parsing innodb output (#956)\* Change call to mkpath to call to Utils module, resolving an issue with old perl (ticket #992)\* snort\_\* : merge fix from branch 1.4 to trunk
New plugins :
\* add plugin : snmp\_\_df\_ram plugin\* add plugin : PostgreSQL 9.0+ streaming replication lag\* add plugin : linux/proc - for graphing information about groups of processes.
