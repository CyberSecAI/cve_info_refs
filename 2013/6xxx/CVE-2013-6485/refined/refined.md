  "CVE-2013-6485": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Pidgin processed certain HTTP responses. A malicious server could send a specially crafted HTTP response, causing Pidgin to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Pidgin.",
    "extracted_information": {
      "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Pidgin when parsing malformed HTTP responses with chunked Transfer-Encoding. Specifically, a large value for Content-Length could cause an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
         "Integer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP response, causing Pidgin to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Pidgin.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when Pidgin parses a crafted HTTP response from a malicious server or a man-in-the-middle.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the HTTP response that is sent to Pidgin. This could involve setting up a malicious server, intercepting a communication between Pidgin and a legitimate server, or controlling a man-in-the-middle."
