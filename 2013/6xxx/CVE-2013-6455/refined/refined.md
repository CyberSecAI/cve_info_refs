Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-6455:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the CentralAuth extension in MediaWiki handles user authentication across different websites. Specifically, during the login process, the user's username was being exposed to external, non-Wikimedia websites. This occurred because the JavaScript returned for CentralAuth's login would update the page DOM with the username, even when included on other sites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privacy Leak:** Usernames were unintentionally being leaked to third-party websites. This exposes a user's identity and their association with a MediaWiki account on external sites they might not intend to link with their wiki activity.
*   **Cross-site Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows information (the username) from a trusted domain (a Wikimedia site) to be accessed on untrusted domains.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Users' usernames, which are often considered personal information, could be revealed to potentially malicious sites, creating a privacy concern.
*   **Potential for Targeted Attacks:** If an attacker can collect usernames they might use this information for targeted social engineering attacks or other forms of malicious activity based on the user's wiki activities.
*   **Loss of Anonymity:** Editors who rely on pseudonymity on Wikipedia, for example, could have their identities revealed on other sites, potentially causing them reputational harm.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Inclusion:** The attack vector involves an attacker embedding the CentralAuth login Javascript on a third-party website and using that to obtain user information.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must be logged into a MediaWiki site to be vulnerable to the attack. If they then browse to an attacker-controlled or compromised website, their username might be exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to host a web page or inject malicious code into a web page. This could be any site visited by a user logged into a MediaWiki site using CentralAuth.
*   No special privileges or access to MediaWiki servers are required.
*   The attacker doesn't require direct access to the user's browser or computer. The attack relies on cross-site JavaScript execution.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved removing the direct HTML update of the user information and instead using an AJAX call to retrieve the user's personal tools list (which includes the username) from the originating wiki.
*   A token-based approach was implemented to avoid caching issues related to user IDs, preventing the reuse of an old session by a potential attacker.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the CentralAuth extension of MediaWiki.
*   The fix was deployed to Wikimedia's servers after the vulnerability was identified.
*   The fix also includes a new message which is shown if the call to retrieve the user information fails.

In summary, CVE-2013-6455 is a privacy vulnerability in MediaWiki's CentralAuth extension that could reveal users' usernames on external websites. The fix involves retrieving user info via AJAX and implementing proper caching and token handling.
