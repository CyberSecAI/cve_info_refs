  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2013-6627",
      "root_cause": "The `HttpStreamParser` class in Google Chrome does not correctly handle HTTP 1xx responses. It keeps these responses in the buffer without removing them, and the code uses an offset from the start of the buffer, rather than the start of the current response, when parsing subsequent headers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious webpage can trigger an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This allows the webpage (running within the sandbox) to read memory from the main process' heap. This could expose sensitive information, such as login cookies, session keys, and function pointers, from the main process.",
      "attack_vector": "A specially crafted HTTP response from a malicious server. The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious website.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a web server and be able to convince a victim to visit a website under the attacker's control.",
       "details": "The vulnerability occurs because the `HttpStreamParser` class doesn't remove HTTP 1xx responses from its internal buffer (`read_buf_`). When parsing subsequent HTTP responses, the code incorrectly calculates the length of the header data, leading to an out-of-bounds read in the `HttpUtil::AssembleRawHeaders` method. This allows copying memory beyond the intended HTTP response data and exposing it to the renderer process."
