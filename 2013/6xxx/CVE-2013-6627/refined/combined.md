# Chrome HTTP 1xx base::String­Tokenizer­T<...>::Quick­Get­Next OOBR

([CVE-2013-6627](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6627))

## Synopsis

A specially crafted HTTP response can allow a malicious web-page to trigger a
out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Google Chrome. The data is read from the
main process' memory.

## Known affected software, attack vectors and potential mitigations

* **Google Chrome up to, but not including, 31.0.1650.48**

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
  web-page. Disabling Java­Script does not prevent an attacker from triggering
  the vulnerable code path, but may prevent exfiltration of information.

  Since the affected code has not been changed since 2009, I assume this
  affects all versions of Chrome released in the last few years.

## Details

The [`Http­Stream­Parser` class](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/http_stream_parser.cc)
is used to send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses. Its `read_­buf_`
member is a buffer used to store HTTP response data received from the server.
Parts of the code are written under the assumption that the response currently
being parsed is always stored at the start of this buffer (as returned by
`read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer()`), other parts take into account that this may not
be the case (`read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer() + read_­buf_­unused_­offset_`). In most
cases, responses are removed from the buffer once they have been parsed and any
superfluous data is moved to the beginning of the buffer, to be treated as part
of the next response. However, the code special cases `HTTP 1xx` replies and
returns a result without removing the request from the buffer. This means that
the response to the next request will not be stored at the start of the buffer,
but after this `HTTP 1xx` response and `read_­buf_­unused_­offset_` should be used
to find where it starts.

The code that special cases HTTP 1xx responses is:

```
  if (end_­of_­header_­offset == -1) {
<<<snip>>>
  } else {
    // Note where the headers stop.
    read_­buf_­unused_­offset_ = end_­of_­header_­offset;

    if (response_->headers->response_­code() / 100 == 1) {
      // After processing a 1xx response, the caller will ask for the next
      // header, so reset state to support that.  We don't just skip these
      // completely because 1xx codes aren't acceptable when establishing a
      // tunnel.
      io_­state_ = STATE_­REQUEST_­SENT;
      response_­header_­start_­offset_ = -1;
<<<Note: the code above does not remove the HTTP 1xx response from the
         buffer.>>>
    } else {
<<<Note: the code that follows either removes the response from the buffer
         immediately, or expects it to be removed in a call to
         Read­Response­Body later.>>>
<<<snip>>>
  return result;
}

```

A look through the code has revealed one location where this can lead to a
security issue (also in `Do­Read­Headers­Complete`). The code uses an offset from
the start of the buffer (rather than the start of the current responses) to
pass as an argument to a `Do­Parse­Response­Headers`.

```
  if (result == ERR_­CONNECTION_­CLOSED) {
<<<snip>>>
    // Parse things as well as we can and let the caller decide what to do.
    int end_­offset;
    if (response_­header_­start_­offset_ >= 0) {
      io_­state_ = STATE_­READ_­BODY_­COMPLETE;
      end_­offset = read_­buf_->offset();
<<<Note: "end_­offset" is relative to the start of the buffer>>>
    } else {
      io_­state_ = STATE_­BODY_­PENDING;
      end_­offset = 0;
<<<Note: "end_­offset" is relative to the start of the current response
         i.e. start + read_­buf_­unused_­offset_.>>>
    }
    int rv = Do­Parse­Response­Headers(end_­offset);
<<<snip>>>

```

`Do­Parse­Response­Headers` passes the argument unchanged to `Http­Util::Assemble­Raw­Headers`:

```
int Http­Stream­Parser::Do­Parse­Response­Headers(int end_­offset) {
  scoped_­refptr<Http­Response­Headers> headers;
  if (response_­header_­start_­offset_ >= 0) {
    headers = new Http­Response­Headers(Http­Util::Assemble­Raw­Headers(
        read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer() + read_­buf_­unused_­offset_, end_­offset));
<<<snip>>>

```

The [`Http­Util::Assemble­Raw­Headers` method](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/http_util.cc)
takes two arguments: a pointer to a buffer, and the length of the buffer. The
pointer is calculated correctly (in `Do­Parse­Response­Headers`) and points to the
start of the current response. The length is the offset that was calculated
incorrectly in `Do­Read­Headers­Complete`. If the current response is preceded by
a `HTTP 1xx` response in the buffer, this length is larger than it should be:
the calculated value will be the correct length plus the size of the previous
`HTTP 1xx` response (`read_­buf_­unused_­offset_`).

```
std::string Http­Util::Assemble­Raw­Headers(const char* input_­begin,
                                         int input_­len) {
  std::string raw_­headers;
  raw_­headers.reserve(input_­len);

  const char* input_­end = input_­begin + input_­len;

```

* `input_­begin` was calculated as `read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer() + read_­buf_­unused_­offset_`,
* `input_­len` was incorrectly calculated as `len(headers) + read_­buf_­unused_­offset_`,
* `input_­end` will be `read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer() + 2 * read_­buf_­unused_­offset_ + len(headers)`
* `input_­end` is now beyond the end of the actual headers.
  The code will continue to rely on this incorrect value to try to create a copy
  of the headers, inadvertently making a copy of data that is not part of this
  response and may not even be part of the `read_­buf_` buffer. This could cause
  the code to copy data from memory that is stored immediately after `read_­buf_`
  into a string that represents the response headers. This string is passed to
  the renderer process that made the request, allowing a web-page inside the
  sandbox to read memory from the main process' heap.

An ASCII diagram might be useful to illustrate what is going on:

read\_­buf\_: "HTTP 100 Continue\r\n...HTTP XXX Current response\r\n...Unused..."

## Repro

The below proof-of-concept consist of a server that hosts a simple web-page.
This web-page uses XMLHttp­Request to make requests to the server. The server
responds with a carefully crafted reply to exploit the vulnerability and leak
data from the main process' memory in the HTTP headers of the response. The
web-page then uses `get­All­Response­Headers()` to read the leaked data, and posts
it to the server, which displays the memory. The Po­C makes no attempt to
influence the layout of the main process' memory, so arbitrary data will be
shown and access violation may occur which crash Chrome. With the Po­C loaded in
one tab, simply browsing the internet in another might show some leaked
information from the pages you visit.

## Exploit

The impact depends on what happens to be stored on the heap immediately
following the buffer. Since a web-page can influence the activities of the main
process (e.g. it can ask it to make other HTTP requests), a certain amount of
control over the heap layout is possible. An attacker could attempt to create a
"heap feng shui"-like attack where careful manipulation of the main process'
activities allow reading of various types of information from the main process'
heap. The most obvious targets that come to mind are http request/response data
for different domains, such as log-in cookies, or session keys and function
pointers that can be used to bypass ASLR/DEP. There are undoubtedly many other
forms of interesting information that can be revealed in this way.

There are little limits to the number of times an attacker can exploit this
vulnerability, assuming the attacker can avoid triggering an access violation:
if the buffer happens to be stored at the end of the heap, attempts to exploit
this vulnerability could trigger an access violation/segmentation fault when
the code attempts to read beyond the buffer from unallocated memory addresses.

## Fix

I identified and tested two approaches to fixing this bug:

* Fix the code where it relies on the response being stored at the start of the
  buffer.

  This addresses the incorrect addressing of memory that causes this
  vulnerability in various parts of the code. The design to keep HTTP 1xx
  responses in the buffer remains unchanged.
* Remove HTTP 1xx responses from the buffer.

  There was inline documentation in the source that explained why HTTP 1xx
  responses were handled in a special way, but it didn't make much sense to me.
  This fix changes the design to no longer keep the HTTP 1xx response in the
  buffer. There is an added benefit to this fix in that it removes a potential
  Do­S attack, where a server responds with many large HTTP 1xx replies, all of
  which are kept in memory and eventually cause an OOM crash in the main
  process.

The later fix was eventually implemented.

Synopsis

A specially crafted HTTP response can allow a malicious web-page to trigger a out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Google Chrome. The data is read from the main process' memory.

Known affected software, attack vectors and potential mitigations

Google Chrome up to, but not including, 31.0.1650.48

An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Java­Script does not prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path, but may prevent exfiltration of information.
Since the affected code has not been changed since 2009, I assume this affects all versions of Chrome released in the last few years.

Details

The Http­Stream­Parser class is used to send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses. Its read_­buf_ member is a buffer used to store HTTP response data received from the server. Parts of the code are written under the assumption that the response currently being parsed is always stored at the start of this buffer (as returned by read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer()), other parts take into account that this may not be the case (read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer() + read_­buf_­unused_­offset_). In most cases, responses are removed from the buffer once they have been parsed and any superfluous data is moved to the beginning of the buffer, to be treated as part of the next response. However, the code special cases HTTP 1xx replies and returns a result without removing the request from the buffer. This means that the response to the next request will not be stored at the start of the buffer, but after this HTTP 1xx response and read_­buf_­unused_­offset_ should be used to find where it starts.

The code that special cases HTTP 1xx responses is:

  if (end_­of_­header_­offset == -1) {
<<<snip>>>
  } else {
    // Note where the headers stop.
    read_­buf_­unused_­offset_ = end_­of_­header_­offset;

    if (response_->headers->response_­code() / 100 == 1) {
      // After processing a 1xx response, the caller will ask for the next
      // header, so reset state to support that.  We don't just skip these
      // completely because 1xx codes aren't acceptable when establishing a
      // tunnel.
      io_­state_ = STATE_­REQUEST_­SENT;
      response_­header_­start_­offset_ = -1;
<<<Note: the code above does not remove the HTTP 1xx response from the
         buffer.>>>
    } else {
<<<Note: the code that follows either removes the response from the buffer
         immediately, or expects it to be removed in a call to
         Read­Response­Body later.>>>
<<<snip>>>
  return result;
}

A look through the code has revealed one location where this can lead to a security issue (also in Do­Read­Headers­Complete). The code uses an offset from the start of the buffer (rather than the start of the current responses) to pass as an argument to a Do­Parse­Response­Headers.

  if (result == ERR_­CONNECTION_­CLOSED) {
<<<snip>>>
    // Parse things as well as we can and let the caller decide what to do.
    int end_­offset;
    if (response_­header_­start_­offset_ >= 0) {
      io_­state_ = STATE_­READ_­BODY_­COMPLETE;
      end_­offset = read_­buf_->offset();
<<<Note: "end_­offset" is relative to the start of the buffer>>>
    } else {
      io_­state_ = STATE_­BODY_­PENDING;
      end_­offset = 0;
<<<Note: "end_­offset" is relative to the start of the current response
         i.e. start + read_­buf_­unused_­offset_.>>>
    }
    int rv = Do­Parse­Response­Headers(end_­offset);
<<<snip>>>
Do­Parse­Response­Headers passes the argument unchanged to Http­Util::Assemble­Raw­Headers:

int Http­Stream­Parser::Do­Parse­Response­Headers(int end_­offset) {
  scoped_­refptr<Http­Response­Headers> headers;
  if (response_­header_­start_­offset_ >= 0) {
    headers = new Http­Response­Headers(Http­Util::Assemble­Raw­Headers(
        read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer() + read_­buf_­unused_­offset_, end_­offset));
<<<snip>>>

The Http­Util::Assemble­Raw­Headers method takes two arguments: a pointer to a buffer, and the length of the buffer. The pointer is calculated correctly (in Do­Parse­Response­Headers) and points to the start of the current response. The length is the offset that was calculated incorrectly in Do­Read­Headers­Complete. If the current response is preceded by a HTTP 1xx response in the buffer, this length is larger than it should be: the calculated value will be the correct length plus the size of the previous HTTP 1xx response (read_­buf_­unused_­offset_).

std::string Http­Util::Assemble­Raw­Headers(const char* input_­begin,
                                         int input_­len) {
  std::string raw_­headers;
  raw_­headers.reserve(input_­len);

  const char* input_­end = input_­begin + input_­len;
input_­begin was calculated as read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer() + read_­buf_­unused_­offset_,
input_­len was incorrectly calculated as len(headers) + read_­buf_­unused_­offset_,
input_­end will be read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer() + 2 * read_­buf_­unused_­offset_ + len(headers)
input_­end is now beyond the end of the actual headers. The code will continue to rely on this incorrect value to try to create a copy of the headers, inadvertently making a copy of data that is not part of this response and may not even be part of the read_­buf_ buffer. This could cause the code to copy data from memory that is stored immediately after read_­buf_ into a string that represents the response headers. This string is passed to the renderer process that made the request, allowing a web-page inside the sandbox to read memory from the main process' heap.

An ASCII diagram might be useful to illustrate what is going on:

read_­buf_:                      "HTTP 100 Continue\r\n...HTTP XXX Current response\r\n...Unused..."
read_­buf_->Start­Of­Buffer()  -----^
read_­buf_->capacity()  ----------[================================================================]
read_­buf_->offset()  ------------[=======================================================]
read_­buf_­unused_­offset_   -------[=======================]

Do­Read­Headers­Complete/Do­Parse­Response­Headers:
end_­offset  ---------------------[=======================================================]

Assemble­Raw­Headers:
input_­begin ---------------------------------------------^
input_­len  ----------------------------------------------[========================================###############]
error in input_­len value   --------------------------------------------------------------[========###############]
  (== read_­buf_­unused_­offset_)
Memory read from the main process' heap  ---------------------------------------------------------[##############]

Repro

The below proof-of-concept consist of a server that hosts a simple web-page. This web-page uses XMLHttp­Request to make requests to the server. The server responds with a carefully crafted reply to exploit the vulnerability and leak data from the main process' memory in the HTTP headers of the response. The web-page then uses get­All­Response­Headers() to read the leaked data, and posts it to the server, which displays the memory. The Po­C makes no attempt to influence the layout of the main process' memory, so arbitrary data will be shown and access violation may occur which crash Chrome. With the Po­C loaded in one tab, simply browsing the internet in another might show some leaked information from the pages you visit.

Exploit

The impact depends on what happens to be stored on the heap immediately following the buffer. Since a web-page can influence the activities of the main process (e.g. it can ask it to make other HTTP requests), a certain amount of control over the heap layout is possible. An attacker could attempt to create a "heap feng shui"-like attack where careful manipulation of the main process' activities allow reading of various types of information from the main process' heap. The most obvious targets that come to mind are http request/response data for different domains, such as log-in cookies, or session keys and function pointers that can be used to bypass ASLR/DEP. There are undoubtedly many other forms of interesting information that can be revealed in this way.

There are little limits to the number of times an attacker can exploit this vulnerability, assuming the attacker can avoid triggering an access violation: if the buffer happens to be stored at the end of the heap, attempts to exploit this vulnerability could trigger an access violation/segmentation fault when the code attempts to read beyond the buffer from unallocated memory addresses.

Fix

I identified and tested two approaches to fixing this bug:

- Fix the code where it relies on the response being stored at the start of the buffer.
This addresses the incorrect addressing of memory that causes this vulnerability in various parts of the code. The design to keep HTTP 1xx responses in the buffer remains unchanged.
- Remove HTTP 1xx responses from the buffer.
There was inline documentation in the source that explained why HTTP 1xx responses were handled in a special way, but it didn't make much sense to me. This fix changes the design to no longer keep the HTTP 1xx response in the buffer. There is an added benefit to this fix in that it removes a potential Do­S attack, where a server responds with many large HTTP 1xx replies, all of which are kept in memory and eventually cause an OOM crash in the main process.
The later fix was eventually implemented.

Time-line

27 September 2013: This vulnerability and two patches were submitted to the Chromium bugtracker.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide

Since November I have been releasing details on all vulnerabilities I
found that I have not released before. This is the 35th entry in the
series. This information is available in more detail on my blog at
<http://blog.skylined.nl/20161219001.html>. There you can find a repro
that triggered this issue in addition to the information below, it also
provides code snippets for the affected code, and a diagram that
attempts to explain the memory layout.

This advisory contains a lot more information about the root cause and
how to exploit it, as Google Bug Bounties reward high quality
bug-reports to a point where it is worth investigating a bug in detail.

If you find these releases useful, and would like to help me make time
to continue releasing this kind of information, you can make a donation
in bitcoin to 183yyxa9s1s1f7JBp­PHPmz­Q346y91Rx5DX.

Chrome HTTP 1xx base::StringTokenizerT<...>::QuickGetNext OOBR
==============================================================
(CVE-2013-6627)

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted HTTP response can allow a malicious web-page to
trigger a out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Google Chrome. The data is
read from the main process' memory.

Known affected software, attack vectors and potential mitigations
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Google Chrome up to, but not including, 31.0.1650.48

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially
  crafted web-page. Disabling JavaScript does not prevent an attacker
  from triggering the vulnerable code path, but may prevent
  exfiltration of information.

  Since the affected code has not been changed since 2009, I assume this
  affects all versions of Chrome released in the last few years.

Details
-------
The `HttpStreamParser` class is used to send HTTP requests and receive
HTTP responses. Its `read_buf_` member is a buffer used to store HTTP
response data received from the server. Parts of the code are written
under the assumption that the response currently being parsed is always
stored at the start of this buffer (as returned by
`read_buf_->StartOfBuffer()`), other parts take into account that this
may not be the case (`read_buf_->StartOfBuffer() +
read_buf_unused_offset_`). In most cases, responses are removed from the
buffer once they have been parsed and any superfluous data is moved to
the beginning of the buffer, to be treated as part of the next response.
However, the code special cases `HTTP 1xx` replies and returns a result
without removing the request from the buffer. This means that the
response to the next request will not be stored at the start of the
buffer, but after this `HTTP 1xx` response and `read_buf_unused_offset_`
should be used to find where it starts.

A look through the code has revealed one location where this can lead to
a security issue (also in `DoReadHeadersComplete`). The code uses an
offset from the start of the buffer (rather than the start of the
current responses) to pass as an argument to a `DoParseResponseHeaders`.
`DoParseResponseHeaders` passes the argument unchanged to
`HttpUtil::AssembleRawHeaders`. The `HttpUtil::AssembleRawHeaders`
method takes two arguments: a pointer to a buffer, and the length of the
buffer. The pointer is calculated correctly (in
`DoParseResponseHeaders`) and points to the
start of the current response. The length is the offset that was
calculated incorrectly in `DoReadHeadersComplete`. If the current
response is preceded by a `HTTP 1xx` response in the buffer, this length
is larger than it should be: the calculated value will be the correct
length plus the size of the previous `HTTP 1xx` response
(`read_buf_unused_offset_`).

The code will continue to rely on this incorrect value to try to create
a copy of the headers, inadvertently making a copy of data that is not
part of this response and may not even be part of the `read_buf_`
buffer. This could cause the code to copy data from memory that is
stored immediately after `read_buf_` into a string that represents the
response headers. This string is passed to the renderer process that
made the request, allowing a web-page inside the sandbox to read memory
from the main process' heap.

Exploit
-------
The impact depends on what happens to be stored on the heap immediately
following the buffer. Since a web-page can influence the activities of
the main process (e.g. it can ask it to make other HTTP requests), a
certain amount of control over the heap layout is possible. An attacker
could attempt to create a "heap feng shui"-like attack where careful
manipulation of the main process' activities allow reading of various
types of information from the main process' heap. The most obvious
targets that come to mind are http request/response data for different
domains, such as log-in cookies, or session keys and function pointers
that can be used to bypass ASLR/DEP. There are undoubtedly many other
forms of interesting information that can be revealed in this way.

There are little limits to the number of times an attacker can exploit
this vulnerability, assuming the attacker can avoid triggering an access
violation: if the buffer happens to be stored at the end of the heap,
attempts to exploit this vulnerability could trigger an access
violation/segmentation fault when the code attempts to read beyond the
buffer from unallocated memory addresses.

Fix
---
I identified and tested two approaches to fixing this bug:
+ Fix the code where it relies on the response being stored at the
  start of the buffer.
  This addresses the incorrect addressing of memory that causes this
  vulnerability in various parts of the code. The design to keep HTTP
  1xx responses in the buffer remains unchanged.

+ Remove HTTP 1xx responses from the buffer.
  There was inline documentation in the source that explained why HTTP
  1xx responses were handled in a special way, but it didn't make much
  sense to me. This fix changes the design to no longer keep the HTTP
  1xx response in the buffer. There is an added benefit to this fix in
  that it removes a potential DoS attack, where a server responds with
  many large HTTP 1xx replies, all of which are kept in memory and
  eventually cause an OOM crash in the main process.

The later fix was eventually implemented.

Time-line
---------
* 27 September 2013: This vulnerability and two patches were submitted
  to the Chromium bugtracker.
* 2 October 2013: A patch for this vulnerability was submitted by
  Google.
* 12 November 2013: This vulnerability was address in version
  31.0.1650.48.
* 19 December 2016: Details of this vulnerability are released.

Cheers,

SkyLined
