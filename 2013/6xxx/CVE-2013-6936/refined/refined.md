Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ajaxfs.php` plugin for MyBB. Specifically, the `tooltip` and `usertooltip` GET parameters are directly incorporated into SQL queries without any validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is SQL injection. The application directly uses user-supplied input from the `tooltip` and `usertooltip` GET parameters within SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** Successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to bypass authentication, read arbitrary database records, modify data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to complete database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `ajaxfs.php` file, where the attacker manipulates the `tooltip` or `usertooltip` parameters with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable MyBB instance.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:**  A basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL syntax to craft the malicious payloads.
