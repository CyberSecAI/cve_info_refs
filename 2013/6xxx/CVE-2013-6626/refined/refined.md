Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-6626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in how Chromium handles interstitial warnings, leading to a potential address bar spoofing vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Address Bar Spoofing:** The core weakness is the ability to manipulate the address bar to display a misleading URL, while the actual content comes from a different source. This is achieved due to issues with how interstitial warnings are displayed.
  
**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing/Malware Distribution:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to create a fake webpage that appears to be a legitimate site to trick users into entering sensitive information (e.g., login credentials) or downloading malicious software.
- **User Deception:** The misleading address bar makes it harder for users to identify malicious websites, increasing the success rate of phishing attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-Based Attack:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious webpage that exploits the address bar spoofing vulnerability when an interstitial warning is triggered. The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting this page, possibly through a link in an email or on another website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Web Server:** The attacker needs access to a web server to host the malicious webpage.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use social engineering tactics to entice the victim to visit the malicious webpage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as "Low" severity in the Google blog post, suggesting a relatively lower risk of exploitation, although it can be part of a larger attack strategy.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is part of the Chromium version 31.0.1650.48 update.

In summary, CVE-2013-6626 is a low-severity address bar spoofing issue in Chromium related to interstitial warnings, which could be exploited to facilitate phishing or malware distribution by misleading users about the true URL of a webpage.
