	* Some usage of passdb checkpassword could have been exploitable by
	  local users. You may need to modify your setup to keep it working.
	  See <http://wiki2.dovecot.org/AuthDatabase/CheckPassword#Security>

	+ auth: Added ability to truncate values logged by
	  auth_verbose_passwords (see 10-logging.conf comment)
	+ mdbox: Added "mdbox_deleted" storage, which can be used to access
	  messages with refcount=0. For example: doveadm import
	  mdbox_deleted:~/mdbox "" mailbox inbox subject oops
	+ ssl-params: Added ssl_dh_parameters_length setting.
	- master process was doing a hostname.domain lookup for each created
	  process, which may have caused a lot of unnecessary DNS lookups.
	- dsync: Syncing over 100 messages at once caused problems in some
	  situations, causing messages to get new UIDs.
	- fts-solr: Different Solr hosts for different users didn't work.
