Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6717:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by executing a specific query containing an OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) specification. This specific type of query causes a flaw in the DB2 server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness lies in how the IBM DB2 server handles queries with OLAP specifications. This leads to an exploitable condition when processing these types of queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to the termination of all connections to the database where the user is connected.
- The database itself can also be deactivated, leading to a denial of service condition for the affected database.
- The impact is limited to the database the user is connected to, other databases on the same DB2 server are not directly affected by the exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious query.
- The attack can be performed remotely.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DB2 server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the DB2 server.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against the database.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need to have high-level privileges, as long as they can connect and execute queries within their assigned database.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

The following IBM DB2 V9.7, V10.1 and V10.5 editions running on AIX, Linux, HP, Solaris and Windows:

*   IBM® DB2® Express Edition
*   IBM® DB2® Workgroup Server Edition
*   IBM® DB2® Enterprise Server Edition
*   IBM® DB2® Advanced Enterprise Server Edition
*   IBM® DB2® Advanced Workgroup Server Edition
*   IBM® DB2® Connect™ Application Server Edition
*   IBM® DB2® Connect™ Enterprise Edition
*   IBM® DB2® Connect™ Unlimited Edition for System i®
*   IBM® DB2® Connect™ Unlimited Edition for System z®
The following IBM V9.8 editions running on AIX and Linux:

*  IBM® DB2® pureScale™ Feature for Enterprise Server Edition

The DB2 Connect products mentioned are affected only if a local database has been created.

The vulnerability is not applicable to DB2 releases before V9.7.

**Remediation:**
- Apply the appropriate fix for this vulnerability.
- Fixes are available for DB2 and DB2 Connect release V9.7 FP9, V10.1 FP3a/FP4 and V10.5 FP3.
- For DB2 V9.8, a special build with an interim patch may be requested by contacting support.

**Workarounds and Mitigations:**
- None are available.
