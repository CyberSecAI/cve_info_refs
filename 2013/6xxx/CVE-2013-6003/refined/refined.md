Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input validation in the "Phone Messages" function of Cybozu Garoon. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or validate user-controlled data that is used to construct email headers, leading to a mail header injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Mail Header Injection:** The vulnerability lies in the ability to inject arbitrary email headers by manipulating the input within the Phone Messages function. This occurs when the "forward Phone Messages to an email address" feature is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can alter the email headers of forwarded phone messages. This could be used to:
    *   Spoof the sender address
    *   Send malicious content by modifying the email body
    *   Redirect emails to different recipients
    *   Potentially bypass email security filters

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the "Phone Messages" function of the Cybozu Garoon application. Specifically, an attacker would need to manipulate input fields that are used in the construction of the email headers.
*   This can be triggered remotely, through the web application interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker requires network access to the Cybozu Garoon system (over the Internet according to analysis).
*   The attacker needs to have an account (created by an administrator according to analysis) within Cybozu Garoon that can access the "Phone Messages" function.
*  No user interaction is required from honest users.
*   Some expertise is required.

**Additional Details (from JPCERT/CC Analysis):**
*   **Access Required**: Can be attacked over the Internet using packets.
*   **Authentication**: Requires an account created by an administrator.
*   **User Interaction Required**: No user interaction needed by honest users.
*   **Exploit Complexity**: Some expertise required.
