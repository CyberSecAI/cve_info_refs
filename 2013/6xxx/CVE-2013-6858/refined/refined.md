{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient sanitization of the instance name in the OpenStack Horizon dashboard.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Stored XSS"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the instance name. When an administrator views the instance details on the 'Volumes', 'Network Topology', or 'Images and Snapshots' pages, this script would execute within their browser, allowing the attacker to potentially modify page content or steal confidential data within the same domain.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into the 'Instance Name' field while launching or editing an instance via the OpenStack API or the Horizon web interface. The injected script is then executed when an administrator views the instance details on the affected pages.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create or edit instances within the OpenStack environment."
