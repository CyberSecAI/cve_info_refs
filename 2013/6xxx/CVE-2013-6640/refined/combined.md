Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2013/12/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, December 4, 2013

Chrome has been updated to 31.0.1650.63 for Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome Frame.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [15 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type:bug-security%20label:Release-1-M31&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID%20Pri%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20OS%20M%20Security_severity%20Security_impact%20Owner%20Reporter). Below, we highlight fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or are particularly interesting. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$1337][[307159](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=307159)] Medium CVE-2013-6634: Session fixation in sync related to 302 redirects. Credit to Andrey Labunets.
[$2000][[314469](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=314469)] High CVE-2013-6635: Use-after-free in editing. Credit to cloudfuzzer[.](https://code.google.com/u/117154691211413633534/)
[$500][[322959](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=322959)] Medium CVE-2013-6636: Address bar spoofing related to modal dialogs. Credit to Bas Venis.

We would also like to thank cloudfuzzer for working with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. $2500 in additional rewards were issued.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[325501](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=325501)] CVE-2013-6637: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* [[319722](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=319722)] Medium CVE-2013-6638: Buffer overflow in v8. This issue was fixed in v8 version 3.22.24.7. Credit to Jakob Kummerow of the Chromium project.
* [[319835](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=319835)] High CVE-2013-6639: Out of bounds write in v8. This issue was fixed in v8 version 3.22.24.7. Credit to Jakob Kummerow of the Chromium project.
* [[319860](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=319860)] Medium CVE-2013-6640: Out of bounds read in v8. This issue was fixed in v8 version 3.22.24.7. Credit to Jakob Kummerow of the Chromium project.

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer).

A full list of changes is available in the [SVN log](http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/branches/1650/src&range=238485:235101&mode=html). Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
