Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6033:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the Lexmark printer's web administrative interface. Specifically, the "Location" and "Contact Name" fields on the "General Settings" configuration page do not properly sanitize user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**
    *   The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the "Location" and "Contact Name" fields. This injected script is then stored by the printer and executed when the administrative web interface displays the affected fields.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within a victim's browser when the victim accesses the printer's administrative interface. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking: the attacker can steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the admin interface.
    *   Malware injection: the attacker can redirect the victim to a malicious site or download malware.
    *   Defacement: the attacker can alter the appearance of the administrative interface.
    *   Other malicious activities within the context of the victim's browser session.
*   Combined with CVE-2013-6032, an attacker may gain full administrative control of the printer.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker would need to access the printer's administrative web interface.
*   The attacker injects malicious script into the "Location" or "Contact Name" fields through the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Lexmark printer's web interface.
*   The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the general settings configuration page.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the printer to exploit this vulnerability since stored XSS is exploited through an authenticated user accessing the modified fields.
