Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Stem Innovation 'IZON' IP camera contains several hard-coded credentials within its Linux distribution and the hidden web application. These credentials are not exposed to the end-user and cannot be changed via normal camera operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hard-coded credentials:** Multiple sets of hardcoded usernames and passwords exist, granting access to various parts of the system:
    *   Telnet: "root" with password "stemroot", "admin" with password "/ADMIN/", and "mg3500" with password "merlin".
    *   HTTP: "user" with password "user" on the hidden web application at `<http://camera-ip/mobileye/>`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Access:** Exploiting the telnet credentials provides root access to the camera's operating system.
*   **Camera Configuration & Stream Access**: Exploiting the HTTP credentials grants access to the camera's stream and configuration details, including third-party API keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the camera (local or remote) can use the hard-coded credentials to gain access.
*   **Telnet Protocol:** Using the telnet credentials, an attacker can directly log into the camera's system.
*  **HTTP Protocol**: Using the web interface credentials, an attacker can access the camera stream and configuration settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the IP camera. This could be within the same local network as the camera or from a remote network if the camera is exposed to the internet.
*   **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker needs knowledge of the hard-coded usernames and passwords, which is publicly available via the provided references.
