Affected Product(s):
====================
Olat
Product: Content Management System 7.8.0.1 (b20130821 N1)
Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote
Severity Level:
===============
Medium
Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability is detected in the Olat Content Management System v7.8.0.1 (b20130821-N1) web-application.
The web vulnerability allows remote attackers to implement/inject own malicious script codes to application-side of the online-service.
The persistent web vulnerability is located in the `Calender` module. Remote attackers are able inject malicious script codes
via POST method request in the event name (o2cl) parameters of the calender service. The script code executes in the main calender
index. Attacker can also share the calender event by using the public function to stream the code to all other users and administrators.
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a low privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (customers), account steal via persistent
web attacks, persistent phishing or persistent module context manipulation.
Request Method(s):
[+] [POST]
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Calender
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] event name (o2cl)
Affected Module(s):
[+] Calender Index - Event
[+] Home Index - Events
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged application user account and
only indirect user interaction (page visit). For demonstration or reproduce ...
Manual steps to reproduce ...
1. Install the CMS and login with your low privileged application user account
2. Open the calender, switch to event and add a new one
3. Inject your own malicious test script code to the event name & date input fields
4. Click the public event button and save the input to reload the edit site
5. The malicious test context executes in the index module of the calender
6. Click the home button and switch on the right site to the calender events
7. The malicious test code will be visible to all users in the same group or to the administrators
8. Successful reproduced ...!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure encode and parse of the events calender name parameter.
Parse also the output section in the main home events listing (right bottom) and encode the calender index name list.
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent post inject web vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure encode and parse of the events calender name parameter.
Parse also the output section in the main home events listing (right bottom) and encode the calender index name list.

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent post inject web vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
