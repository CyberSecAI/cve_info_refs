Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6793

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a persistent input validation vulnerability within the Olat CMS. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input when creating calendar events.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious script code into the calendar event name parameter (`o2cl`). This script is then persistently stored and executed when the calendar is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Persistent Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal user session cookies, leading to unauthorized access to accounts.
- **Account Stealing:** Through persistent web attacks, malicious scripts can be used to steal user credentials.
- **Persistent Phishing:** Attackers can inject phishing attacks that appear legitimate, tricking users into revealing sensitive information.
- **Persistent Module Context Manipulation:** The malicious scripts can manipulate the context of the calendar module or other parts of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- Attackers inject malicious script code via a POST request to the calendar module, specifically within the `event name (o2cl)` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires a low-privileged user account within the Olat CMS.
- Low user interaction is required. The malicious script executes when a user views the calendar or home page where the event is displayed, making this a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `Calender` module of Olat CMS v7.8.0.1.
- The injected code executes in the main calendar index and can be shared to all users.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to inject and trigger the malicious script code.
- The vulnerability can be patched by properly encoding and parsing the calendar event name parameter on both input and output.
- The security risk is estimated as medium (+).
