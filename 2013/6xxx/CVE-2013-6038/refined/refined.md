- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when SketchUp Viewer parses a specially crafted .SKP file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system in the context of the logged-in user.
- **Attack vectors:** By convincing a user to open a specially crafted .SKP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious .SKP file and convince a user to open it with the vulnerable SketchUp Viewer. The attacker is remote and unauthenticated.
