Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-6041:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation of a cookie value used by the application. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or validate the cookie value, allowing backtick characters to be included.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote OS Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands by manipulating the cookie value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Complete server compromise is possible, as arbitrary commands can be executed on the underlying operating system. This could lead to data theft, system disruption, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious cookie. The `SOFTCookies7972_sid` cookie is targeted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server, including setting cookie values.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example demonstrates injecting the command `cat /etc/passwd > /home/yourUserName/public_html/pwned.html` within the cookie value, which would output the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file to a publicly accessible web page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Webuzo versions 2.1.3 and earlier.
- This vulnerability was fixed in Webuzo 2.1.4.
- The advisory also mentions CVE-2013-6042 (Reflected XSS) and CVE-2013-6043 (Username Enumeration), which are separate vulnerabilities.
