- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal flaw in the HP Data Protector Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe) when processing packets with opcode 42.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability. The software improperly validates the file path provided in the packet, allowing an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload malicious files to arbitrary locations on the target system. This can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted network packets with opcode 42 to the vulnerable service. This packet contains directory traversal sequences in the file path, allowing an attacker to write files outside of the intended directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to port 5555 of the target machine where the HP Data Protector Backup Client Service is running.
