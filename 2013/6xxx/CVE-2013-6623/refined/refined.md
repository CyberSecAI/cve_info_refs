Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2013-6623:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read within the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) implementation in the Blink/Webkit rendering engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is an attempt to read data from a memory location outside the allocated buffer for the SVG image rendering, causing a memory access violation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   The out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to:
    -   **Information disclosure:** By reading memory outside the intended boundary, an attacker could gain access to sensitive data located in adjacent memory regions.
    -   **Denial of service:** The out-of-bounds read may cause the application or browser to crash due to memory access violations.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious SVG image.
-   When the vulnerable browser attempts to parse and render this image, the out-of-bounds read condition is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious SVG to a user using the vulnerable browser.
- This could be achieved by hosting it on a website, embedding it in an email, or any other method that would cause the browser to process it.
-   No specific user interaction beyond loading the malicious SVG is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
