# Greenbone OpenVAS

OpenVAS is a full-featured vulnerability scanner. Its capabilities
include unauthenticated and authenticated testing, various high-level
and low-level internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning
for large-scale scans and a powerful internal programming language
to implement any type of vulnerability test.

The scanner obtains the tests for detecting vulnerabilities from a
[feed](https://www.greenbone.net/en/feed-comparison/) that
has a long history and daily updates.

OpenVAS has been developed and driven forward by the company
[Greenbone](https://www.greenbone.net/en/) since 2006. As part of the commercial
vulnerability management product family Greenbone Enterprise Appliance,
the scanner forms the
[Greenbone Community Edition](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/background.html#architecture)
together with other open-source modules.

> For OpenVAS Manager, this is a security release addressing a serious
> security bug and it is highly recommended to update any installation of
> OpenVAS Manager 3.0 and 4.0 with the corresponding release.
>
> A software bug in OpenVAS Manager allowed an attacker to bypass the OMP
> authentication procedure. The attack vector was remotely available in
> case OpenVAS Manager was listening on a public network interface. In
> case of successful attack, the attacker gained partial rights to execute
> OMP commands.  The bypass authentication was, however, incomplete and
> several OMP commands failed to execute properly.

Use CVE-2013-6765.

> For OpenVAS Administrator, this is a security release addressing a very
> serious security bug and it is highly recommended to update any
> installation of OpenVAS Administrator 1.2 and 1.3 with the corresponding
> release.

> A software bug in OpenVAS Administrator allowed an attacker to bypass

Use CVE-2013-6766.

Apparently a discloser will provide technical details at a later date.
