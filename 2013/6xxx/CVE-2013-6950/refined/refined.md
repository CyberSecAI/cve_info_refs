Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Belkin Wemo Home Automation firmware distribution feed does not use SSL encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cleartext transmission of sensitive information. Specifically, firmware update notices are delivered through an RSS-like mechanism over a non-encrypted channel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could spoof the RSS feed and push malicious firmware updates to WeMo users.

**Attack Vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. An attacker can intercept the unencrypted firmware update feed and inject malicious updates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the WeMo device and the firmware update server. This could be achieved through various methods such as network spoofing or by controlling a network router.

**Additional Details:**
The advisory from IOActive confirms that the firmware update notices are sent to the paired device, not the Wemo device directly. This makes the update process vulnerable to spoofing the RSS feed, because the feed is not encrypted, allowing for the injection of malicious updates if the attacker can intercept the feed.

The advisory also mentions a lack of certificate validation on the client side, which means the client would not detect an invalid certificate presented by an attacker. This vulnerability is related to CVE-2013-6951, but this analysis only concerns CVE-2013-6950.
