  "CVE-2013-6458": {
    "description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the way several libvirt block APIs handled domain jobs. A remote attacker able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the libvirtd process (usually root).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free flaw caused by a race condition in how libvirt handles domain jobs when detaching devices concurrently with block statistics requests. Specifically, `qemuDomainBlockStats` accesses a disk pointer from `vm->def` after acquiring a job but domain is unlocked while waiting on a job condition which means data behind the disk pointer may have disappeared in the meantime.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker with read-only access to libvirtd could crash libvirtd or potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs a read-only connection to libvirtd and must trigger concurrent device detach and block statistics requests.",
     "additional_details": "The issue was found in several libvirt block APIs. The specific API `virDomainBlockStats` was crashing due to the `dev_name` parameter in `qemuMonitorJSONGetBlockStatsInfo` becoming NULL. The bug is reproducible by attaching and detaching an EBS disk on an Openstack instance repeatedly. Concurrent `virDomainDetachDeviceFlags` and `virDomainBlockStats` calls trigger the use-after-free."
