| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1050213#c0)  Russell Bryant    2014-01-08 21:03:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 847344](attachment.cgi?id=847344&action=diff "backport of fix for nova") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=847344&action=edit "backport of fix for nova") backport of fix for nova  The code for receiving and processing qpid messages runs in its own greenthread.  Unfortunately, there is a code path that if it raises an exception, the greenthread will die silently, without any entry in the log file.  In particular, the code in question is:  <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py?h=stable/grizzly#n468>  if self.session.next_receiver() raises an exception other than qpid's Empty or ConnectionError exceptions, the thread will die and no more messages will be received.  The fix is to backport the portion of the following change that applies to impl_qpid.  That includes the new decorator in excutils and the change to impl_qpid.py.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1050213#c1)  Russell Bryant    2014-01-08 21:11:55 UTC  ``` The change that needs to be backported is: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/32235/13>  I also attached a version of the backport for nova to [bug 1050213](show_bug.cgi?id=1050213 "CLOSED ERRATA - Thread consuming qpid messages can die silently")   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1050213#c3)  Russell Bryant    2014-01-09 15:28:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 847690](attachment.cgi?id=847690&action=diff "reproducing failure mode") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=847690&action=edit "reproducing failure mode") reproducing failure mode  Just so I don't forget it, this is how I tested this bug (attached patch).  I used the attached patch for force an exception to occur in the qpid reply thread roughly 30 seconds after the nova-compute service started.  With the @excutils.forever_retry_uncaught_exceptions decorator applied, the exception is logged and operation continues normally.  Without the decorator, the thread dies silently, and the only entries in the compute log are from where nova-compute no longer receives any responses.  You see timeout errors waiting for responses from conductor.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1050213#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-30 20:00:28 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0112.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1059504#c0)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-30 01:46:01 UTC  ``` JuanFra Rodriguez Cardoso discovered that nova was not correctly enabling SSL parameters when using the qpid client. Enabling "qpid_protocol = ssl" in nova.conf would not result in SSL being used to commnicate to qpid. If qpid was not configured to enforce SSL this could lead to sensitive information being sent in the clear.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1059504#c1)  Rob Crittenden    2014-01-30 02:20:53 UTC  ``` I don't think the qpid connection is actually successful, even with require_encryption off, so no data actually flows. Did you do any network tracing to confirm that data goes over the wire unencrypted?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1059504#c2)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-30 03:54:08 UTC  ``` Yes I did. It made the connection and worked as normal (with no ssl) even though ssl was enabled in the nova.conf.  After applying the patch and restarting nova-compute it fails to connect to qpid (as I had not setup certificate etc.. in qpid).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1059504#c3)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-30 04:46:56 UTC  ``` So looking at the code. The Connection class in qpid.messaging has no attribute named "protocol". So in the nova qpid rpc implementation without the patch, all that is happening is a new str attribute called "protocol" is getting created and is then ignored.  A regular tcp connection is made as the transport attribute is still set to 'tcp' which is the default.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1059504#c4)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-30 04:59:50 UTC  ``` Upstream bug report:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo/+bug/1158807](https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo/%2Bbug/1158807)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1059504#c5)  Rob Crittenden    2014-01-30 14:17:34 UTC  ``` Ok, I see what you're saying. If you just set protocol to ssl it is basically a no-op. A user may not know to change the port as well.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1059504#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-30 20:00:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2014:0112 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0112.html>   ``` |  |

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c0)  Dharmit Shah    2013-10-03 07:47:19 UTC  ``` Description of problem: GroupAffinityFilter doesn't work as expected.  There's an upstream bug [https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1218878](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/%2Bbug/1218878) tracking the issue about GroupAffinityFilter and GroupAntiAffinityFilter. Commit for the same is proposed in <https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/4233e16ba2f5bb85e93494b6eeb9ffff31dbdf30>  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): RHOS 3.0  How reproducible:  Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.  Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c1)  Xavier Queralt    2013-11-06 11:23:02 UTC  ``` There is already a backport of the patch for grizzly upstream, if it gets in we'll get it in the next rebase.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c2)  Xavier Queralt    2013-12-02 20:22:28 UTC  ``` How to reproduce:  1. Deploy openstack with two compute nodes (compute1 and compute2). 2. Set the key 'scheduler_default_filters' in /etc/nova/nova.conf to have the following filters:   * AvailabilityZoneFilter,RamFilter,ComputeFilter,GroupAntiAffinityFilter 3. Restart the scheduler:   * service openstack-nova-scheduler restart 4. Start two instances, one on each compute node:   * nova boot --image cirros --flavor m1.tiny --availability-zone nova:compute1 vm-compute1   * nova boot --image cirros --flavor m1.tiny --availability-zone nova:compute2 vm-compute2 5. Start another instance in a group:   * nova boot --image cirros --flavor m1.tiny --hint group=foo vm-compute 6. Without the fix the instance will move to the ERROR state and a WARNING will appear in scheduler.log.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c4)  Stephen Gordon    2013-12-09 19:23:25 UTC  ``` Xavier, how is group "foo" actually defined (and the policy set)? I thought the API for this didn't get accepted yet?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c5)  Xavier Queralt    2013-12-10 08:24:53 UTC  ``` In 3.0 only the GroupAntiAffinityFilter exists.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c6)  Xavier Queralt    2013-12-10 08:42:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Stephen Gordon from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c4)) > Xavier, how is group "foo" actually defined (and the policy set)? I thought > the API for this didn't get accepted yet?  Until the blueprint linked from [bug 978507](show_bug.cgi?id=978507) is completed (expected for Icehouse), the group's policy will be defined by the group filter the scheduler is using. In Havana both affinity and anti affinity filters are available, while in Grizzly only the anti affinity exists.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c8)  Ami Jeain    2014-01-27 11:02:55 UTC  ``` verified according to [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c2](show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c2 "CLOSED ERRATA - GroupAntiAffinityFilter filters are broken"): I have now successfully created 2 instances in group, 2 in each one of the computes. No errors found in nova (scheduler and compute)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1014948#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-30 19:59:49 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0112.html>   ``` |  |

## Details

Darragh O'Reilly discovered that the Ubuntu packaging for OpenStack Nova

did not properly set up its sudo configuration. If a different flaw was

found in OpenStack Nova, this vulnerability could be used to escalate

privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-1068](/security/CVE-2013-1068))

Bernhard M. Wiedemann and Pedraig Brady discovered that OpenStack Nova did

not properly verify the virtual size of a QCOW2 images. A remote

authenticated attacker could exploit this to create a denial of service via

disk consumption. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-4463](/security/CVE-2013-4463), [CVE-2013-4469](/security/CVE-2013-4469))

JuanFra Rodriguez Cardoso discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce

SSL connections when Nova was configured to use QPid and qpid\_protocol is

set to 'ssl'. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle

attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. Ubuntu

does not use QPid with Nova by default. This issue did not affect Ubuntu

14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-6491](/security/CVE-2013-6491))

Loganathan Parthipan discovered that OpenStack Nova did not properly create

expected files during KVM live block migration. A remote authenticated

attacker could exploit this to obtain root disk snapshot contents via

ephemeral storage. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-7130](/security/CVE-2013-7130))

Stanislaw Pitucha discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce the image

format when rescuing an instance. A remote authenticated attacker could

exploit this to read host files. In the default installation, attackers

would be isolated by the libvirt guest AppArmor profile. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0134](/security/CVE-2014-0134))

Mark Heckmann discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce RBAC policy

when adding security group rules via the EC2 API. A remote authenticated

user could exploit this to gain unintended access to this API. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0167](/security/CVE-2014-0167))

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Previously, the procedure for enabling SSL in Qpid connections, 'qpid\_protocol = ssl' in /etc/glance/glance-api.conf, set the connection protocol. However, the python-qpid client expects a connection transport type. The mismatch prevented Qpid from actually establishing an SSL connection. With this release, the 'qpid\_protocol = ssl' setting now enables SSL for the connection transport instead of connection protocol. As such, Qpid can now successfully establish SSL connections. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Clones: | [1021536](show_bug.cgi?id=1021536 "CLOSED ERRATA - Setting Qpid SSL protocol sets wrong variable") [1021537](show_bug.cgi?id=1021537 "CLOSED ERRATA - Setting Qpid SSL protocol sets wrong variable")  ([view as bug list](buglist.cgi?bug_id=1021536,1021537)) | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2014-01-30 19:59:39 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c0)  Rob Crittenden    2013-08-13 22:11:44 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Cloned from upstream bug [https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo/+bug/1158807](https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo/%2Bbug/1158807)  By default, TCP is used as transport for QPID connections. If you like to enable SSL, there is a flat 'qpid_protocol = ssl' available in nova.conf. However, python-qpid client is awaiting transport type instead of protocol. It seems to be a bug:  Solution: (<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py#L323>)  WRONG: self.connection.protocol = self.conf.qpid_protocol CORRECT: self.connection.transport = self.conf.qpid_protocol  Regards, JuanFra.

Note that you're checking it against icehosue but this BZ is for the grizzly branch. You can find the patch in the external trackers section (<https://review.openstack.org/47574>) and it has nothing to do with the code you quote.  To test this one should change qpid to use SSL, set in nova.conf qpid_protocol=ssl and restart all the nova services.  Take into account that the other components' configuration must be updated too and that not all the components decided to backport this patch (I think it is missing only in 3.0 cinder) which means that not all of them will be able to use qpid with ssl.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c11)  Omri Hochman    2014-01-27 10:23:07 UTC  ``` I checked with puddle 2014-01-22.1 it's latest grizzly not icehouse: <http://download.lab.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/OpenStack/Grizzly/2014-01-22.1/puddle.repo>  Well I've tried to set nova.conf with qpid_protocol=ssl and restart nova services then run nova cli commands-> I'm getting ERROR: [Errno 111] Connection refused.    I've tried to set some other .conf files to work with ssl but maybe I'm missing something - How can I verify that this patch is actually in side the code in grizzly ? I think that will be the verification in this case.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c12)  Xavier Queralt    2014-01-27 10:58:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to Omri Hochman from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c11)) > I checked with puddle 2014-01-22.1 it's latest grizzly not icehouse: > <http://download.lab.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/OpenStack/Grizzly/2014-01-22.1/> > puddle.repo  The link to github pointed to master (a.k.a. Icehouse), that's why the code differs from what you can find packaged in Grizzly.  >  > Well I've tried to set nova.conf with qpid_protocol=ssl and restart nova > services then run nova cli commands-> I'm getting ERROR: [Errno 111] > Connection refused.   >   For this to work you must configure QPID to use ssl too. I can't point you to any documentation on how to configure that right now but   > I've tried to set some other .conf files to work with ssl but maybe I'm > missing something - How can I verify that this patch is actually in side the > code in grizzly ? I think that will be the verification in this case.  To verify that the patch has been applied you must check the line 370 of the file nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py, there instead of setting the attribute self.connection.protocol it should be setting self.connection.transport (see the patches in the external trackers section for more details).   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c13)  Omri Hochman    2014-01-27 12:54:08 UTC  ``` Verified with  python-nova-2013.1.4-4.el6ost.noarch (puddle 2014-01-22.1)  The fix is in the code: -----------------------  self.connection.transport = self.conf.qpid_protocol  (In line 370 :/usr/lib/python2.6/sitepackages/nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-30 19:59:39 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

With this release, the 'qpid\_protocol = ssl' setting now enables SSL for the connection transport instead of connection protocol. As such, Qpid can now successfully establish SSL connections. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Clones: | [1021536](show_bug.cgi?id=1021536 "CLOSED ERRATA - Setting Qpid SSL protocol sets wrong variable") [1021537](show_bug.cgi?id=1021537 "CLOSED ERRATA - Setting Qpid SSL protocol sets wrong variable")  ([view as bug list](buglist.cgi?bug_id=1021536,1021537)) | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2014-01-30 19:59:39 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c0)  Rob Crittenden    2013-08-13 22:11:44 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Cloned from upstream bug [https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo/+bug/1158807](https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo/%2Bbug/1158807)  By default, TCP is used as transport for QPID connections. If you like to enable SSL, there is a flat 'qpid_protocol = ssl' available in nova.conf. However, python-qpid client is awaiting transport type instead of protocol. It seems to be a bug:  Solution: (<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py#L323>)  WRONG: self.connection.protocol = self.conf.qpid_protocol CORRECT: self.connection.transport = self.conf.qpid_protocol  Regards, JuanFra.

Note that you're checking it against icehosue but this BZ is for the grizzly branch. You can find the patch in the external trackers section (<https://review.openstack.org/47574>) and it has nothing to do with the code you quote.  To test this one should change qpid to use SSL, set in nova.conf qpid_protocol=ssl and restart all the nova services.  Take into account that the other components' configuration must be updated too and that not all the components decided to backport this patch (I think it is missing only in 3.0 cinder) which means that not all of them will be able to use qpid with ssl.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c11)  Omri Hochman    2014-01-27 10:23:07 UTC  ``` I checked with puddle 2014-01-22.1 it's latest grizzly not icehouse: <http://download.lab.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/OpenStack/Grizzly/2014-01-22.1/puddle.repo>  Well I've tried to set nova.conf with qpid_protocol=ssl and restart nova services then run nova cli commands-> I'm getting ERROR: [Errno 111] Connection refused.    I've tried to set some other .conf files to work with ssl but maybe I'm missing something - How can I verify that this patch is actually in side the code in grizzly ? I think that will be the verification in this case.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c12)  Xavier Queralt    2014-01-27 10:58:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to Omri Hochman from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c11)) > I checked with puddle 2014-01-22.1 it's latest grizzly not icehouse: > <http://download.lab.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/OpenStack/Grizzly/2014-01-22.1/> > puddle.repo  The link to github pointed to master (a.k.a.

I think that will be the verification in this case.  To verify that the patch has been applied you must check the line 370 of the file nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py, there instead of setting the attribute self.connection.protocol it should be setting self.connection.transport (see the patches in the external trackers section for more details).   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c13)  Omri Hochman    2014-01-27 12:54:08 UTC  ``` Verified with  python-nova-2013.1.4-4.el6ost.noarch (puddle 2014-01-22.1)  The fix is in the code: -----------------------  self.connection.transport = self.conf.qpid_protocol  (In line 370 :/usr/lib/python2.6/sitepackages/nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=996766#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-30 19:59:39 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0112)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues and three bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (nova), which
provides services for provisioning, managing, and using virtual
machine instances.

It was discovered that enabling "qpid\_protocol = ssl" in the nova.conf file
did not result in nova using SSL to communicate to Qpid. If Qpid was not
configured to enforce SSL this could lead to sensitive information being
sent unencrypted over the communication channel. (CVE-2013-6491)

A flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute controlled the size of disk
images. An authenticated remote user could use malicious compressed qcow2
disk images to consume large amounts of disk space, potentially causing a
denial of service on the OpenStack Compute nodes. (CVE-2013-4463)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
CVE-2013-4463. Upstream acknowledges Bernhard M. Wiedemann of SuSE as the
original reporter of this issue.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* When using GroupAntiAffinityFilter, the scheduler was not filtering

instances in the group, which could cause an instance to not be scheduled
at all if a group was specified on boot. With this fix, groups are taken
into account and the instance is scheduled as expected. (BZ#1014948)

* If an exchange had not been created previously by a consumer, the

publisher would crash because it could not find the specified exchange.
This resulted from Qpid's direct publisher using the wrong exchange type
'Direct'. With this fix, the exchange type in the publisher has been
changed to 'direct'. (BZ#1042055)

* Unhandled errors in the Qpid consuming thread could kill it silently and

isolate the component from the rest of the system. To fix this, the
consuming thread has been made more resilient to errors by ensuring it does
