{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2013-6491",
    "description": "OpenStack Nova did not enforce SSL connections when Nova was configured to use QPid and qpid_protocol is set to 'ssl'. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information.",
    "affected_component": "openstack-nova",
    "root_cause": "The 'qpid_protocol = ssl' setting in the configuration file set the connection protocol, but the python-qpid client expects a connection transport type. This mismatch prevented Qpid from actually establishing an SSL connection, causing communication to occur over an unencrypted channel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure communication",
      "Incorrect configuration handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker could intercept and view sensitive information that was intended to be sent over an encrypted SSL connection.",
     "attack_vector": "A remote attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the network path between the OpenStack Nova service and the Qpid message broker."
