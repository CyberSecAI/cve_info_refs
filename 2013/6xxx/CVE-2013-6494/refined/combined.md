## Description

[![@ghost](https://github.com/ghost.png?size=48)](/ghost)[ghost](/ghost)opened [on Feb 20, 2014](https://github.com/rhinstaller/fedup/issues/44#issue-27941612)

Michael Scherer of Red Hat reports:

While trying to upgrade my F19 to F20 using fedup, I noticed that it use

a directory in /var/tmp/, with a fixed known name.

cachedir = '/var/tmp/fedora-upgrade'

One note, in fedup 0.8.0 (F20) the directory is now /var/tmp/system-upgrade

As per <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1066679>

Suggest you use Python mkdtemp():

<http://kurt.seifried.org/2012/03/14/creating-temporary-files-securely/>

Thanks.
