  "CVE-2013-6431": {
    "description": "Linux kernel built with the IPv6 protocol(CONFIG_IPv6) along with the IPv6 source address based routing support(CONFIG_IPV6_SUBTREE) is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw. It could occur while doing an ioctl(SIOCADDRT) call on an IPv6 socket. User would need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to perform such a call.  A user/program with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges could use this flaw to crash a system resulting in DoS.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the `fib6_add` function when handling IPv6 routes with source-based routing. Specifically, an error condition within the `fib6_add_1` function can lead to the `pn` variable being NULL, while a subsequent check attempts to dereference it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Insufficient error handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can cause a system crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vector": "Local. An attacker needs to make an ioctl(SIOCADDRT) call on an IPv6 socket.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must possess `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges."
