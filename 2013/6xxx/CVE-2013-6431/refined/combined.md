| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1039054#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-12-06 13:29:52 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the IPv6 protocol(CONFIG_IPv6) along with the IPv6 source address based routing support(CONFIG_IPV6_SUBTREE) is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw. It could occur while doing an ioctl(SIOCADDRT) call on an IPv6 socket. User would need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to perform such a call.  A user/program with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges could use this flaw to crash a system resulting in DoS.  Upstream fix: -------------  -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/ae7b4e1f213aa659aedf9c6ecad0bf5f0476e1e2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1039054#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2013-12-06 14:13:51 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1039054#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-28 17:41:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2014:0100 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0100.html>   ``` |  |

Adding the device list from the Windows driver description files

ASB TL131 TDD LTE", from China Mobile. This device is tested
and verified to work. The others are assumed to work based on
using the same Windows driver.
Many of these devices support multiple QMI/wwan ports, requiring
multiple interface matching entries. All devices are composite,
providing a mix of one or more serial, storage or Android Debug
Brigde functions in addition to the wwan function.
This device list included an update of one previously known device,
which was incorrectly assumed to have a Gobi 2K layout. This is
corrected.

HID: uhid: allocate static minor
commit 19872d20c890073c5207d9e02bb8f14d451a11eb upstream.
udev has this nice feature of creating "dead" /dev/ device-nodes if
it finds a devnode: modalias. Once the node is accessed, the kernel
automatically loads the module that provides the node. However, this
requires udev to know the major:minor code to use for the node. This
feature was introduced by:

driver core: add devname module aliases to allow module on-demand auto-loading
However, uhid uses dynamic minor numbers so this doesn't actually work. We
need to load uhid to know which minor it's going to use.
Hence, allocate a static minor (just like uinput does) and we're good
to go.

Btrfs: skip subvol entries when checking if we've created a dir already
commit a05254143cd183b18002cbba7759a1e4629aa762 upstream.
We have logic to see if we've already created a parent directory by check to see
if an inode inside of that directory has a lower inode number than the one we
are currently processing. The logic is that if there is a lower inode number
then we would have had to made sure the directory was created at that previous
point. The problem is that subvols inode numbers count from the lowest objectid
in the root tree, which may be less than our current progress. So just skip if
our dir item key is a root item. This fixes the original test and the xfstest
version I made that added an extra subvol create. Thanks,

Btrfs: change how we queue blocks for backref checking
commit b6c60c8018c4e9beb2f83fc82c09f9d033766571 upstream.
Previously we only added blocks to the list to have their backrefs checked if
the level of the block is right above the one we are searching for. This is
because we want to make sure we don't add the entire path up to the root to the
lists to make sure we process things one at a time. This assumes that if any
blocks in the path to the root are going to be not checked (shared in other
words) then they will be in the level right above the current block on up. This
isn't quite right though since we can have blocks higher up the list that are
shared because they are attached to a reloc root. But we won't add this block
to be checked and then later on we will BUG\_ON(!upper->checked). So instead
keep track of wether or not we've queued a block to be checked in this current
search, and if we haven't go ahead and queue it to be checked. This patch fixed
the panic I was seeing where we BUG\_ON(!upper->checked). Thanks,

tile: use a more conservative \_\_my\_cpu\_offset in CONFIG\_PREEMPT
commit f862eefec0b68e099a9fa58d3761ffb10bad97e1 upstream.
It turns out the kernel relies on barrier() to force a reload of the
percpu offset value. Since we can't easily modify the definition of
barrier() to include "tp" as an output register, we instead provide a
definition of \_\_my\_cpu\_offset as extended assembly that includes a fake
stack read to hazard against barrier(), forcing gcc to know that it
must reread "tp" and recompute anything based on "tp" after a barrier.
This fixes observed hangs in the slub allocator when we are looping
on a percpu cmpxchg\_double.
A similar fix for ARMv7 was made in June in change 509eb76ebf97.

HID: wiimote: fix FF deadlock
commit f50f9aabf32db7414551ffdfdccc71be5f3d6e7d upstream.
The input core has an internal spinlock that is acquired during event
injection via input\_event() and friends but also held during FF callbacks.
That means, there is no way to share a lock between event-injection and FF
handling. Unfortunately, this is what is required for wiimote state
tracking and what we do with state.lock and input->lock.
This deadlock can be triggered when using continuous data reporting and FF
on a wiimote device at the same time. I takes me at least 30m of
stress-testing to trigger it but users reported considerably shorter
times (http://bpaste.net/show/132504/) when using some gaming-console
emulators.
The real problem is that we have two copies of internal state, one in the
wiimote objects and the other in the input device. As the input-lock is
not supposed to be accessed from outside of input-core, we have no other
chance than offloading FF handling into a worker. This actually works
pretty nice and also allows to implictly merge fast rumble changes into a
single request.
Due to the 3-layered workers (rumble+queue+l2cap) this might reduce FF
responsiveness. Initial tests were fine so lets fix the race first and if
it turns out to be too slow we can always handle FF out-of-band and skip
the queue-worker.

xfs: fix node forward in xfs\_node\_toosmall
commit 997def25e4b9cee3b01609e18a52f926bca8bd2b upstream.
Commit f5ea1100 cleans up the disk to host conversions for
node directory entries, but because a variable is reused in
xfs\_node\_toosmall() the next node is not correctly found.
If the original node is small enough (<= 3/8 of the node size),
this change may incorrectly cause a node collapse when it should
not. That will cause an assert in xfstest generic/319:
Assertion failed: first <= last && last < BBTOB(bp->b\_length),

Keep the original node header to get the correct forward node.
(When a node is considered for a merge with a sibling, it overwrites the
sibling pointers of the original incore nodehdr with the sibling's
pointers. This leads to loop considering the original node as a merge
candidate with itself in the second pass, and so it incorrectly
determines a merge should occur.)

When perparing cyclic\_dma buffers by the sound layer, it will dump the
following lockdep trace. The leading snd\_pcm\_action\_single get called
with read\_lock\_irq called. To fix this, we change the kcalloc call from
GFP\_KERNEL to GFP\_ATOMIC.

commit fcaaba6c7136fe47e5a13352f99a64b019b6d2c5 upstream.
We need to free the ld\_active list head before jumping into the callback
routine. Otherwise the callback could run into issue\_pending and change
our ld\_active list head we just going to free. This will run the channel
list into an currupted and undefined state.

dmaengine: imx-dma: fix lockdep issue between irqhandler and tasklet
commit 5a276fa6bdf82fd442046969603968c83626ce0b upstream.
The tasklet and irqhandler are using spin\_lock while other routines are
using spin\_lock\_irqsave/restore. This leads to lockdep issues as
described bellow. This patch is changing the code to use
spinlock\_irq\_save/restore in both code pathes.
As imxdma\_xfer\_desc always gets called with spin\_lock\_irqsave lock held,
this patch also removes the spare call inside the routine to avoid
double locking.

irq: Force hardirq exit's softirq processing on its own stack
commit ded797547548a5b8e7b92383a41e4c0e6b0ecb7f upstream.
The commit facd8b80c67a3cf64a467c4a2ac5fb31f2e6745b
("irq: Sanitize invoke\_softirq") converted irq exit
calls of do\_softirq() to \_\_do\_softirq() on all architectures,
assuming it was only used there for its irq disablement
properties.
But as a side effect, the softirqs processed in the end
of the hardirq are always called on the inline current
stack that is used by irq\_exit() instead of the softirq
stack provided by the archs that override do\_softirq().
The result is mostly safe if the architecture runs irq\_exit()
on a separate irq stack because then softirqs are processed
on that same stack that is near empty at this stage (assuming
hardirq aren't nesting).
Otherwise irq\_exit() runs in the task stack and so does the softirq
too. The interrupted call stack can be randomly deep already and
the softirq can dig through it even further. To add insult to the
injury, this softirq can be interrupted by a new hardirq, maximizing
the chances for a stack overrun as reported in powerpc for example:

Since this is a regression, this patch proposes a minimalistic
and low-risk solution by blindly forcing the hardirq exit processing of
softirqs on the softirq stack. This way we should reduce significantly
the opportunities for task stack overflow dug by softirqs.
Longer term solutions may involve extending the hardirq stack coverage to
irq\_exit(), etc...

iscsi-target: Only perform wait\_for\_tasks when performing shutdown
commit e255a28598e8e63070322fc89bd34189dd660a89 upstream.
This patch changes transport\_generic\_free\_cmd() to only wait\_for\_tasks
when shutdown=true is passed to iscsit\_free\_cmd().
With the advent of >= v3.10 iscsi-target code using se\_cmd->cmd\_kref,
the extra wait\_for\_tasks with shutdown=false is unnecessary, and may
end up causing an extra context switch when releasing WRITEs.

mm: avoid reinserting isolated balloon pages into LRU lists
commit 117aad1e9e4d97448d1df3f84b08bd65811e6d6a upstream.
Isolated balloon pages can wrongly end up in LRU lists when
migrate\_pages() finishes its round without draining all the isolated
page list.
The same issue can happen when reclaim\_clean\_pages\_from\_list() tries to
reclaim pages from an isolated page list, before migration, in the CMA
path. Such balloon page leak opens a race window against LRU lists
shrinkers that leads us to the following kernel panic:

that array with \_\_align(sizeof(void \*)). That should properly align that

mwifiex: fix PCIe hs\_cfg cancel cmd timeout
commit b7be1522def9a9988b67afd0be999c50a96394b5 upstream.
For pcie8897, the hs\_cfg cancel command (0xe5) times out when host
comes out of suspend. This is caused by an incompleted host sleep
handshake between driver and firmware.
Like SDIO interface, PCIe also needs to go through firmware power
save events to complete the handshake for host sleep configuration.
Only USB interface doesn't require power save events for hs\_cfg.

Bug 60815 - Interface hangs in mwifiex\_usb
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=60815
We have 4 bytes of interface header for packets delivered to SDIO
and PCIe, but not for USB interface.
In Tx AMSDU case, currently 4 bytes of garbage data is unnecessarily
appended for USB packets. This sometimes leads to a firmware hang,
because it may not interpret the data packet correctly.
Problem is fixed by removing this redundant headroom for USB.

Since commit 1499d9f "mwifiex: don't drop carrier flag over suspend"

staging: comedi: ni\_65xx: (bug fix) confine insn\_bits to one subdevice
commit 677a31565692d596ef42ea589b53ba289abf4713 upstream.
The `insn\_bits` handler `ni\_65xx\_dio\_insn\_bits()` has a `for` loop that
currently writes (optionally) and reads back up to 5 "ports" consisting
of 8 channels each. It reads up to 32 1-bit channels but can only read
and write a whole port at once - it needs to handle up to 5 ports as the
first channel it reads might not be aligned on a port boundary. It
breaks out of the loop early if the next port it handles is beyond the
final port on the card. It also breaks out early on the 5th port in the
loop if the first channel was aligned. Unfortunately, it doesn't check
that the current port it is dealing with belongs to the comedi subdevice
the `insn\_bits` handler is acting on. That's a bug.
Redo the `for` loop to terminate after the final port belonging to the
subdevice, changing the loop variable in the process to simplify things
a bit. The `for` loop could now try and handle more than 5 ports if the
subdevice has more than 40 channels, but the test `if (bitshift >= 32)`
ensures it will break out early after 4 or 5 ports (depending on whether
the first channel is aligned on a port boundary). (`bitshift` will be
between -7 and 7 inclusive on the first iteration, increasing by 8 for
each subsequent operation.)

subprocess\_info->path != NULL") but was by error reintroduced by commit
7f57cfa4e2aa ("usermodehelper: kill the sub\_info->path[0] check").
This bug seems to exist since 2.6.19 (the version which core dump to
pipe was added). Depending on kernel version and config, some side
effect might happen immediately after this oops (e.g. kernel panic with
2.6.32-358.18.1.el6).

mm/bounce.c: fix a regression where MS\_SNAP\_STABLE (stable pages snapshotting) was ignored
commit 83b2944fd2532b92db099cb3ada12df32a05b368 upstream.
The "force" parameter in \_\_blk\_queue\_bounce was being ignored, which
means that stable page snapshots are not always happening (on ext3).
This of course leads to DIF disks reporting checksum errors, so fix this
regression.
The regression was introduced in commit 6bc454d15004 ("bounce: Refactor

mm: Fix generic hugetlb pte check return type.
[ Upstream commit 26794942461f438a6bc725ec7294b08a6bd782c4 ]
The include/asm-generic/hugetlb.h stubs that just vector huge\_pte\_\*()
calls to the pte\_\*() implementations won't work in certain situations.
x86 and sparc, for example, return "unsigned long" from the bit
checks, and just go "return pte\_val(pte) & PTE\_BIT\_FOO;"
But since huge\_pte\_\*() returns 'int', if any high bits on 64-bit are
relevant, they get chopped off.
The net effect is that we can loop forever trying to COW a huge page,
because the huge\_pte\_write() check signals false all the time.

esp\_scsi: Fix tag state corruption when autosensing.
[ Upstream commit 21af8107f27878813d0364733c0b08813c2c192a ]
Meelis Roos reports a crash in esp\_free\_lun\_tag() in the presense
of a disk which has died.
The issue is that when we issue an autosense command, we do so by
hijacking the original command that caused the check-condition.
When we do so we clear out the ent->tag[] array when we issue it via
find\_and\_prep\_issuable\_command(). This is so that the autosense
command is forced to be issued non-tagged.
That is problematic, because it is the value of ent->tag[] which
determines whether we issued the original scsi command as tagged
vs. non-tagged (see esp\_alloc\_lun\_tag()).
And that, in turn, is what trips up the sanity checks in
esp\_free\_lun\_tag(). That function needs the original ->tag[] values
in order to free up the tag slot properly.
Fix this by remembering the original command's tag values, and
having esp\_alloc\_lun\_tag() and esp\_free\_lun\_tag() use them.

That last sizeof() expression evaluates to sizeof(size\_t) which is
not what was intended.
Also even the corrected:

ipc: fix race with LSMs
commit 53dad6d3a8e5ac1af8bacc6ac2134ae1a8b085f1 upstream.
Currently, IPC mechanisms do security and auditing related checks under
RCU. However, since security modules can free the security structure,
for example, through selinux\_[sem,msg\_queue,shm]\_free\_security(), we can
race if the structure is freed before other tasks are done with it,
creating a use-after-free condition. Manfred illustrates this nicely,
for instance with shared mem and selinux:
-> do\_shmat calls rcu\_read\_lock()
-> do\_shmat calls shm\_object\_check().
Checks that the object is still valid - but doesn't acquire any locks.
Then it returns.
-> do\_shmat calls security\_shm\_shmat (e.g. selinux\_shm\_shmat)
-> selinux\_shm\_shmat calls ipc\_has\_perm()
-> ipc\_has\_perm accesses ipc\_perms->security
shm\_close()
-> shm\_close acquires rw\_mutex & shm\_lock
-> shm\_close calls shm\_destroy
-> shm\_destroy calls security\_shm\_free (e.g. selinux\_shm\_free\_security)
-> selinux\_shm\_free\_security calls ipc\_free\_security(&shp->shm\_perm)
-> ipc\_free\_security calls kfree(ipc\_perms->security)
This patch delays the freeing of the security structures after all RCU
readers are done. Furthermore it aligns the security life cycle with
that of the rest of IPC - freeing them based on the reference counter.
For situations where we need not free security, the current behavior is
kept. Linus states:
"... the old behavior was suspect for another reason too: having the
security blob go away from under a user sounds like it could cause
various other problems anyway, so I think the old code was at least
\_prone\_ to bugs even if it didn't have catastrophic behavior."
I have tested this patch with IPC testcases from LTP on both my
quad-core laptop and on a 64 core NUMA server. In both cases selinux is
enabled, and tests pass for both voluntary and forced preemption models.
While the mentioned races are theoretical (at least no one as reported
them), I wanted to make sure that this new logic doesn't break anything
we weren't aware of.

ipc,msg: prevent race with rmid in msgsnd,msgrcv
commit 4271b05a227dc6175b66c3d9941aeab09048aeb2 upstream.
This fixes a race in both msgrcv() and msgsnd() between finding the msg
and actually dealing with the queue, as another thread can delete shmid
underneath us if we are preempted before acquiring the
kern\_ipc\_perm.lock.
Manfred illustrates this nicely:
Assume a preemptible kernel that is preempted just after
msq = msq\_obtain\_object\_check(ns, msqid)
in do\_msgrcv(). The only lock that is held is rcu\_read\_lock().
Now the other thread processes IPC\_RMID. When the first task is
resumed, then it will happily wait for messages on a deleted queue.
Fix this by checking for if the queue has been deleted after taking the
lock.

ipc/sem.c: fix race in sem\_lock()
commit 5e9d527591421ccdb16acb8c23662231135d8686 upstream.
The exclusion of complex operations in sem\_lock() is insufficient: after
acquiring the per-semaphore lock, a simple op must first check that
sem\_perm.lock is not locked and only after that test check
complex\_count. The current code does it the other way around - and that
creates a race. Details are below.
The patch is a complete rewrite of sem\_lock(), based in part on the code
from Mike Galbraith. It removes all gotos and all loops and thus the
risk of livelocks.
I have tested the patch (together with the next one) on my i3 laptop and
it didn't cause any problems.
The bug is probably also present in 3.10 and 3.11, but for these kernels
it might be simpler just to move the test of sma->complex\_count after
the spin\_is\_locked() test.
Details of the bug:
Assume:
- sma->complex\_count = 0.
- Thread 1: semtimedop(complex op that must sleep)
- Thread 2: semtimedop(simple op).
Pseudo-Trace:
Thread 1: sem\_lock(): acquire sem\_perm.lock
Thread 1: sem\_lock(): check for ongoing simple ops
Nothing ongoing, thread 2 is still before sem\_lock().
Thread 1: try\_atomic\_semop()
<<< preempted.
Thread 2: sem\_lock():
static inline int sem\_lock(struct sem\_array \*sma, struct sembuf \*sops,
int nsops)
{
int locknum;
again:
if (nsops == 1 && !sma->complex\_count) {
struct sem \*sem = sma->sem\_base + sops->sem\_num;
/\* Lock just the semaphore we are interested in. \*/
spin\_lock(&sem->lock);
/\*
\* If sma->complex\_count was set while we were spinning,
\* we may need to look at things we did not lock here.
\*/
if (unlikely(sma->complex\_count)) {
spin\_unlock(&sem->lock);
goto lock\_array;
}
<<<<<<<<<
<<< complex\_count is still 0.
<<<
<<< Here it is preempted
<<<<<<<<<
Thread 1: try\_atomic\_semop() returns, notices that it must sleep.
Thread 1: increases sma->complex\_count.
Thread 1: drops sem\_perm.lock
Thread 2:
/\*

\* sem\_array; we cannot enter our critical section,
\* but have to wait for the global lock to be released.
\*/
if (unlikely(spin\_is\_locked(&sma->sem\_perm.lock))) {
spin\_unlock(&sem->lock);
spin\_unlock\_wait(&sma->sem\_perm.lock);
goto again;
}
<<< sem\_perm.lock already dropped, thus no "goto again;"

nilfs2: fix issue with race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks
commit 7f42ec3941560f0902fe3671e36f2c20ffd3af0a upstream.
Many NILFS2 users were reported about strange file system corruption
(for example):
NILFS: bad btree node (blocknr=185027): level = 0, flags = 0x0, nchildren = 768
NILFS error (device sda4): nilfs\_bmap\_last\_key: broken bmap (inode number=11540)
But such error messages are consequence of file system's issue that takes
place more earlier. Fortunately, Jerome Poulin
and Anton Eliasson  were reported about another
issue not so recently. These reports describe the issue with segctor
thread's crash:
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 0000000000004c83
IP: nilfs\_end\_page\_io+0x12/0xd0 [nilfs2]
Call Trace:
nilfs\_segctor\_do\_construct+0xf25/0x1b20 [nilfs2]
nilfs\_segctor\_construct+0x17b/0x290 [nilfs2]
nilfs\_segctor\_thread+0x122/0x3b0 [nilfs2]
kthread+0xc0/0xd0
ret\_from\_fork+0x7c/0xb0
These two issues have one reason. This reason can raise third issue
too. Third issue results in hanging of segctor thread with eating of
100% CPU.
REPRODUCING PATH:
One of the possible way or the issue reproducing was described by
Jermoe me Poulin :
1. init S to get to single user mode.
2. sysrq+E to make sure only my shell is running
3. start network-manager to get my wifi connection up
4. login as root and launch "screen"
5. cd /boot/log/nilfs which is a ext3 mount point and can log when NILFS dies.
6. lscp | xz -9e > lscp.txt.xz
7. mount my snapshot using mount -o cp=3360839,ro /dev/vgUbuntu/root /mnt/nilfs
8. start a screen to dump /proc/kmsg to text file since rsyslog is killed
9. start a screen and launch strace -f -o find-cat.log -t find
/mnt/nilfs -type f -exec cat {} > /dev/null \;
10. start a screen and launch strace -f -o apt-get.log -t apt-get update
11. launch the last command again as it did not crash the first time
12. apt-get crashes
13. ps aux > ps-aux-crashed.log
13. sysrq+W
14. sysrq+E wait for everything to terminate
15. sysrq+SUSB
Simplified way of the issue reproducing is starting kernel compilation
task and "apt-get update" in parallel.
REPRODUCIBILITY:
The issue is reproduced not stable [60% - 80%]. It is very important to
have proper environment for the issue reproducing. The critical
conditions for successful reproducing:
(1) It should have big modified file by mmap() way.
(2) This file should have the count of dirty blocks are greater that
several segments in size (for example, two or three) from time to time
during processing.
(3) It should be intensive background activity of files modification
in another thread.
INVESTIGATION:
First of all, it is possible to see that the reason of crash is not valid
page address:
NILFS [nilfs\_segctor\_complete\_write]:2100 bh->b\_count 0, bh->b\_blocknr 13895680, bh->b\_size 13897727, bh->b\_page 0000000000001a82
NILFS [nilfs\_segctor\_complete\_write]:2101 segbuf->sb\_segnum 6783
Moreover, value of b\_page (0x1a82) is 6786. This value looks like segment
number. And b\_blocknr with b\_size values look like block numbers. So,
buffer\_head's pointer points on not proper address value.

Usually, for every segment we collect dirty files in list. Then, dirty
blocks are gathered for every dirty file, prepared for write and
submitted by means of nilfs\_segbuf\_submit\_bh() call. Finally, it takes
place complete write phase after calling nilfs\_end\_bio\_write() on the
block layer. Buffers/pages are marked as not dirty on final phase and
processed files removed from the list of dirty files.
It is possible to see that we had three prepare\_write and submit\_bio
phases before segbuf\_wait and complete\_write phase. Moreover, segments
compete between each other for dirty blocks because on every iteration
of segments processing dirty buffer\_heads are added in several lists of
payload\_buffers:
[SEGMENT 6784]: bh->b\_assoc\_buffers.next ffff880218a0d5f8, bh->b\_assoc\_buffers.prev ffff880218bcdf50
[SEGMENT 6785]: bh->b\_assoc\_buffers.next ffff880218a0d5f8, bh->b\_assoc\_buffers.prev ffff880222cc7ee8
The next pointer is the same but prev pointer has changed. It means
that buffer\_head has next pointer from one list but prev pointer from
another. Such modification can be made several times. And, finally, it
can be resulted in various issues: (1) segctor hanging, (2) segctor
crashing, (3) file system metadata corruption.
FIX:
This patch adds:
(1) setting of BH\_Async\_Write flag in nilfs\_segctor\_prepare\_write()
for every proccessed dirty block;
(2) checking of BH\_Async\_Write flag in
nilfs\_lookup\_dirty\_data\_buffers() and
nilfs\_lookup\_dirty\_node\_buffers();
(3) clearing of BH\_Async\_Write flag in nilfs\_segctor\_complete\_write(),
nilfs\_abort\_logs(), nilfs\_forget\_buffer(), nilfs\_clear\_dirty\_page().

Bluetooth: Fix rfkill functionality during the HCI setup stage
commit bf5430360ebe4b2d0c51d91f782e649107b502eb upstream.
We need to let the setup stage complete cleanly even when the HCI device
is rfkilled. Otherwise the HCI device will stay in an undefined state
and never get notified to user space through mgmt (even when it gets
unblocked through rfkill).
This patch makes sure that hci\_dev\_open() can be called in the HCI\_SETUP
stage, that blocking the device doesn't abort the setup stage, and that
the device gets proper powered down as soon as the setup stage completes
in case it was blocked meanwhile.
The bug that this patch fixed can be very easily reproduced using e.g.
the rfkill command line too. By running "rfkill block all" before
inserting a Bluetooth dongle the resulting HCI device goes into a state
where it is never announced over mgmt, not even when "rfkill unblock all"
is run.

Bluetooth: Fix security level for peripheral role
commit f8776218e8546397be64ad2bc0ebf4748522d6e3 upstream.
While playing the peripheral role, the host gets a LE Long Term Key
Request Event from the controller when a connection is established
with a bonded device. The host then informs the LTK which should be
used for the connection. Once the link is encrypted, the host gets
an Encryption Change Event.
Therefore we should set conn->pending\_sec\_level instead of conn->
sec\_level in hci\_le\_ltk\_request\_evt. This way, conn->sec\_level is
properly updated in hci\_encrypt\_change\_evt.
Moreover, since we have a LTK associated to the device, we have at
least BT\_SECURITY\_MEDIUM security level.

brcmfmac: obtain platform data upon module initialization
commit db4efbbeb457b6f9f4d8c4b090d1170d12f026e1 upstream.
The driver uses platform\_driver\_probe() to obtain platform data
if any. However, that function is placed in the .init section so
it must be called upon driver module initialization.
The problem was reported by Fenguang Wu resulting in a kernel
oops because the .init section was already freed.

fuse: fix fallocate vs. ftruncate race
commit 0ab08f576b9e6a6b689fc6b4e632079b978e619b upstream.
A former patch introducing FUSE\_I\_SIZE\_UNSTABLE flag provided detailed
description of races between ftruncate and anyone who can extend i\_size:
> 1. As in the previous scenario fuse\_dentry\_revalidate() discovered that i\_size
> changed (due to our own fuse\_do\_setattr()) and is going to call
> truncate\_pagecache() for some 'new\_size' it believes valid right now. But by
> the time that particular truncate\_pagecache() is called ...
> 2. fuse\_do\_setattr() returns (either having called truncate\_pagecache() or
> not -- it doesn't matter).
> 3. The file is extended either by write(2) or ftruncate(2) or fallocate(2).
> 4. mmap-ed write makes a page in the extended region dirty.
This patch adds necessary bits to fuse\_file\_fallocate() to protect from that
race.

fuse: wait for writeback in fuse\_file\_fallocate()
commit bde52788bdb755b9e4b75db6c434f30e32a0ca0b upstream.
The patch fixes a race between mmap-ed write and fallocate(PUNCH\_HOLE):
1) An user makes a page dirty via mmap-ed write.
2) The user performs fallocate(2) with mode == PUNCH\_HOLE|KEEP\_SIZE
and  covering the page.
3) Before truncate\_pagecache\_range call from fuse\_file\_fallocate,
the page goes to write-back. The page is fully processed by fuse\_writepage
(including end\_page\_writeback on the page), but fuse\_flush\_writepages did
nothing because fi->writectr < 0.
4) truncate\_pagecache\_range is called and fuse\_file\_fallocate is finishing
by calling fuse\_release\_nowrite. The latter triggers processing queued
write-back request which will write stale data to the hole soon.
Changed in v2 (thanks to Brian for suggestion):
- Do not truncate page cache until FUSE\_FALLOCATE succeeded. Otherwise,
we can end up in returning -ENOTSUPP while user data is already punched
from page cache. Use filemap\_write\_and\_wait\_range() instead.
Changed in v3 (thanks to Miklos for suggestion):
- fuse\_wait\_on\_writeback() is prone to livelocks; use fuse\_set\_nowrite()
instead. So far as we need a dirty-page barrier only, fuse\_sync\_writes()
should be enough.
- rebased to for-linus branch of fuse.git

commit 8f21bd0090052e740944f9397e2be5ac7957ded7 upstream.
The csum\_partial\_copy\_generic() function saves the PowerPC non-volatile

Unfortunately, it fails to restore them upon error exit from this loop,
which results in silent corruption of these registers in the presumably
rare event of an access exception within that loop.
This commit therefore restores these register on error exit from the loop.

powerpc: Fix memory hotplug with sparse vmemmap
commit f7e3334a6bcb42e7295a9bd9cb36ca4e6e4e66b4 upstream.
Previous commit 46723bfa540... introduced a new config option
HAVE\_BOOTMEM\_INFO\_NODE that ended up breaking memory hot-remove for ppc
when sparse vmemmap is not defined.
This patch defines HAVE\_BOOTMEM\_INFO\_NODE for ppc and adds the call to
register\_page\_bootmem\_info\_node. Without this we get a BUG\_ON for memory
hot remove in put\_page\_bootmem().
This also adds a stub for register\_page\_bootmem\_memmap to allow ppc to build
with sparse vmemmap defined. Leaving this as a stub is fine since the same
vmemmap addresses are also handled in vmemmap\_populate and as such are
properly mapped.

powerpc/tm: Switch out userspace PPR and DSCR sooner
commit e9bdc3d6143d1c4b8d8ce5231fc958268331f983 upstream.
When we do a treclaim or trecheckpoint we end up running with userspace
PPR and DSCR values. Currently we don't do anything special to avoid
running with user values which could cause a severe performance
degradation.
This patch moves the PPR and DSCR save and restore around treclaim and
trecheckpoint so that we run with user values for a much shorter period.
More care is taken with the PPR as it's impact is greater than the DSCR.
This is similar to user exceptions, where we run HTM\_MEDIUM early to
ensure that we don't run with a userspace PPR values in the kernel.

powerpc/perf: Fix handling of FAB events
commit a53b27b3abeef406de92a2bb0ceb6fb4c3fb8fc4 upstream.
Commit 4df4899 "Add power8 EBB support" included a bug in the handling
of the FAB\_CRESP\_MATCH and FAB\_TYPE\_MATCH fields.
These values are pulled out of the event code using EVENT\_THR\_CTL\_SHIFT,
however we were then or'ing that value directly into MMCR1.
This meant we were failing to set the FAB fields correctly, and also
potentially corrupting the value for PMC4SEL. Leading to no counts for
the FAB events and incorrect counts for PMC4.
The fix is simply to shift left the FAB value correctly before or'ing it
with MMCR1.

powerpc/iommu: Use GFP\_KERNEL instead of GFP\_ATOMIC in iommu\_init\_table()
commit 1cf389df090194a0976dc867b7fffe99d9d490cb upstream.
Under heavy (DLPAR?) stress, we tripped this panic() in
arch/powerpc/kernel/iommu.c::iommu\_init\_table():
page = alloc\_pages\_node(nid, GFP\_ATOMIC, get\_order(sz));
if (!page)
panic("iommu\_init\_table: Can't allocate %ld bytes\n", sz);
Before the panic() we got a page allocation failure for an order-2
allocation. There appears to be memory free, but perhaps not in the
ATOMIC context. I looked through all the call-sites of
iommu\_init\_table() and didn't see any obvious reason to need an ATOMIC
allocation. Most call-sites in fact have an explicit GFP\_KERNEL
allocation shortly before the call to iommu\_init\_table(), indicating we
are not in an atomic context. There is some indirection for some paths,
but I didn't see any locks indicating that GFP\_KERNEL is inappropriate.
With this change under the same conditions, we have not been able to
reproduce the panic.

iommu/arm-smmu: don't enable SMMU device until probing has completed
commit fd90cecbde065eac6ecc3ef38abace725ad27010 upstream.
We currently reset and enable the SMMU before the device has finished
being probed, so if we fail later on (for example, because we couldn't
request a global irq successfully) then we will leave the device in an
active state.
This patch delays the reset and enabling of the SMMU hardware until
probing has completed.

gpio/omap: auto-setup a GPIO when used as an IRQ
commit fac7fa162a19100298d5d91359960037dc5bfca9 upstream.
The OMAP GPIO controller HW requires a pin to be configured in GPIO
input mode in order to operate as an interrupt input. Since drivers
should not be aware of whether an interrupt pin is also a GPIO or not,
the HW should be fully configured/enabled as an IRQ if a driver solely
uses IRQ APIs such as request\_irq(), and never calls any GPIO-related
APIs. As such, add the missing HW setup to the OMAP GPIO controller's
irq\_chip driver.
Since this bypasses the GPIO subsystem we have to ensure that another
driver won't be able to request the same GPIO pin that is used as an
IRQ and set its direction as output. Requesting the GPIO and setting
its direction as input is allowed though.
This fixes smsc911x ethernet support for tobi and igep OMAP3 boards
and OMAP4 SDP SPI based ethernet that use a GPIO as an interrupt line.

fs/binfmt\_elf.c: prevent a coredump with a large vm\_map\_count from Oopsing
commit 72023656961b8c81a168a7a6762d589339d0d7ec upstream.
A high setting of max\_map\_count, and a process core-dumping with a large
enough vm\_map\_count could result in an NT\_FILE note not being written,
and the kernel crashing immediately later because it has assumed
otherwise.
Reproduction of the oops-causing bug described here:

This patch make that section optional in that case. fill\_files\_note()
should signify the error, and also let the info struct in
elf\_core\_dump() be zero-initialized so that we can check for the
optionally written note.

regulator: ti-abb: Fix bias voltage glitch in transition to bypass mode
commit bf00ca35cec8f0894dcfd90f88b03af1d5c7b86f upstream.
As documented in Application Note SWPA117 v2.1(NDA), LDO override has a
requirement that when switching from Bias active + override active
mode(FBB/RBB) to Bypass(nominal) mode, LDO reset must be performed
\*after\* LDO transitions to Bypass(nominal) mode.
The same rule in reverse applies when switching from a ABB bypass mode
to ABB enabled - LDO override \*must\* be performed prior to transition to
required ABB mode, if we do not do that, the same glitch takes place.
Currently while transitioning to ABB bypass, we reset the LDO overide
prior to the transition which causes a few milliseconds where ABB LDO
voltage could go all the way to 800mV(based on SoC process node),
during this period, the delta voltage between VDD rail and VBB rail
could cause the system to improperly function.

When the 'avr32\_comparator' clockevent device is registered,
the clockevent core sets the mode of that clockevent device
to CLOCK\_EVT\_MODE\_SHUTDOWN. Due to this, the 'comparator\_mode'
function calls the 'cpu\_idle\_poll\_ctrl' to disables idle poll.
This results in the aforementioned warning because the polling
is not enabled yet.
Change the code to only disable idle poll if it is enabled by
the same function to avoid the warning.

bonding: Fix broken promiscuity reference counting issue
[ Upstream commit 5a0068deb611109c5ba77358be533f763f395ee4 ]
Recently grabbed this report:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1005567
Of an issue in which the bonding driver, with an attached vlan encountered the
following errors when bond0 was taken down and back up:
dummy1: promiscuity touches roof, set promiscuity failed. promiscuity feature of
device might be broken.
The error occurs because, during \_\_bond\_release\_one, if we release our last
slave, we take on a random mac address and issue a NETDEV\_CHANGEADDR
notification. With an attached vlan, the vlan may see that the vlan and bond
mac address were in sync, but no longer are. This triggers a call to dev\_uc\_add
and dev\_set\_rx\_mode, which enables IFF\_PROMISC on the bond device. Then, when
we complete \_\_bond\_release\_one, we use the current state of the bond flags to
determine if we should decrement the promiscuity of the releasing slave. But
since the bond changed promiscuity state during the release operation, we
incorrectly decrement the slave promisc count when it wasn't in promiscuous mode
to begin with, causing the above error
Fix is pretty simple, just cache the bonding flags at the start of the function
and use those when determining the need to set promiscuity.
This is also needed for the ALLMULTI flag

IPv6 NAT: Do not drop DNATed 6to4/6rd packets
[ Upstream commit 7df37ff33dc122f7bd0614d707939fe84322d264 ]
When a router is doing DNAT for 6to4/6rd packets the latest
anti-spoofing commit 218774dc ("ipv6: add anti-spoofing checks for
6to4 and 6rd") will drop them because the IPv6 address embedded does
not match the IPv4 destination. This patch will allow them to pass by
testing if we have an address that matches on 6to4/6rd interface. I
have been hit by this problem using Fedora and IPV6TO4\_IPV4ADDR.
Also, log the dropped packets (with rate limit).

ipv6: udp packets following an UFO enqueued packet need also be handled by UFO
[ Upstream commit 2811ebac2521ceac84f2bdae402455baa6a7fb47 ]
In the following scenario the socket is corked:
If the first UDP packet is larger then the mtu we try to append it to the
write queue via ip6\_ufo\_append\_data. A following packet, which is smaller
than the mtu would be appended to the already queued up gso-skb via
plain ip6\_append\_data. This causes random memory corruptions.
In ip6\_ufo\_append\_data we also have to be careful to not queue up the
same skb multiple times. So setup the gso frame only when no first skb
is available.
This also fixes a shortcoming where we add the current packet's length to
cork->length but return early because of a packet > mtu with dontfrag set
(instead of sutracting it again).

skge: fix invalid value passed to pci\_unmap\_sigle

In my patch c194992cbe71c20bb3623a566af8d11b0bfaa721 ("skge: fix

new mapping (not old) was passed to pci\_unmap\_single.
If we enable CONFIG\_DMA\_API\_DEBUG, it results in this warning:
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at lib/dma-debug.c:986 check\_sync+0x4c4/0x580()

This patch makes the skge driver pass the correct value to

on-stack variable "ee" and unmaps it if mapping of the new descriptor
succeeded.
This patch should be backported to 3.11-stable.

ip: generate unique IP identificator if local fragmentation is allowed
[ Upstream commit 703133de331a7a7df47f31fb9de51dc6f68a9de8 ]
If local fragmentation is allowed, then ip\_select\_ident() and
ip\_select\_ident\_more() need to generate unique IDs to ensure
correct defragmentation on the peer.
For example, if IPsec (tunnel mode) has to encrypt large skbs
that have local\_df bit set, then all IP fragments that belonged
to different ESP datagrams would have used the same identificator.
If one of these IP fragments would get lost or reordered, then
peer could possibly stitch together wrong IP fragments that did
not belong to the same datagram. This would lead to a packet loss
or data corruption.

copying large files to a NFS mounted host was taking absurdly large
time.
Turns out that TX BD reclaim had a sublte bug.
Loop starts off from @txbd\_dirty cursor and stops when it hits a BD
still in use by controller. However when it stops it needs to keep the
cursor at that very BD to resume scanning in next iteration. However it
was erroneously incrementing the cursor, causing the next scan(s) to
fail too, unless the BD chain was completely drained out.

[ Upstream commit 3f96a532113131d5a65ac9e00fc83cfa31b0295f ]
Adapt the same behaviour for SCTP as present in TCP for ICMP redirect
messages. For IPv6, RFC4443, section 2.4. says:
...
(e) An ICMPv6 error message MUST NOT be originated as a result of
receiving the following:
...
(e.2) An ICMPv6 redirect message [IPv6-DISC].
...
Therefore, do not report an error to user space, just invoke dst's redirect
callback and leave, same for IPv4 as done in TCP as well. The implication
w/o having this patch could be that the reception of such packets would
generate a poll notification and in worst case it could even tear down the
whole connection. Therefore, stop updating sk\_err on redirects.

bridge: fix NULL pointer deref of br\_port\_get\_rcu

The NULL deref happens when br\_handle\_frame is called between these
2 lines of del\_nbp:

In br\_handle\_frame the return of br\_port\_get\_rcu(dev) is dereferenced

!(dev->priv\_flags & IFF\_BRIDGE\_PORT)
Eric Dumazet pointed out the testing of IFF\_BRIDGE\_PORT is not necessary
here since we're in rcu\_read\_lock and we have synchronize\_net() in

scenario where you could have a value outside the allowed range

This patch fixes this by clamping the value when we enable STP.
I had to move the locking around a bit to ensure that there is

xen-netback: count number required slots for an skb more carefully
[ Upstream commit 6e43fc04a6bc357d260583b8440882f28069207f ]
When a VM is providing an iSCSI target and the LUN is used by the
backend domain, the generated skbs for direct I/O writes to the disk
have large, multi-page skb->data but no frags.
With some lengths and starting offsets, xen\_netbk\_count\_skb\_slots()
would be one short because the simple calculation of
DIV\_ROUND\_UP(skb\_headlen(), PAGE\_SIZE) was not accounting for the
decisions made by start\_new\_rx\_buffer() which does not guarantee
responses are fully packed.
For example, a skb with length < 2 pages but which spans 3 pages would
be counted as requiring 2 slots but would actually use 3 slots.
skb->data:
| 1111|222222222222|3333 |
Fully packed, this would need 2 slots:
|111122222222|22223333 |
But because the 2nd page wholy fits into a slot it is not split across
slots and goes into a slot of its own:
|1111 |222222222222|3333 |
Miscounting the number of slots means netback may push more responses
than the number of available requests. This will cause the frontend
to get very confused and report "Too many frags/slots". The frontend
never recovers and will eventually BUG.
Fix this by counting the number of required slots more carefully. In
xen\_netbk\_count\_skb\_slots(), more closely follow the algorithm used by
xen\_netbk\_gop\_skb() by introducing xen\_netbk\_count\_frag\_slots() which
is the dry-run equivalent of netbk\_gop\_frag\_copy().

net: sctp: fix ipv6 ipsec encryption bug in sctp\_v6\_xmit
[ Upstream commit 95ee62083cb6453e056562d91f597552021e6ae7 ]
Alan Chester reported an issue with IPv6 on SCTP that IPsec traffic is not
being encrypted, whereas on IPv4 it is. Setting up an AH + ESP transport
does not seem to have the desired effect:
SCTP + IPv4:
22:14:20.809645 IP (tos 0x2,ECT(0), ttl 64, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto AH (51), length 116)

22:14:20.813270 IP (tos 0x2,ECT(0), ttl 64, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto AH (51), length 340)
192.168.0.5 > 192.168.0.2: AH(spi=0x00000043,sumlen=16,seq=0x1):
SCTP + IPv6:
22:31:19.215029 IP6 (class 0x02, hlim 64, next-header SCTP (132) payload length: 364)
fe80::222:15ff:fe87:7fc.3333 > fe80::92e6:baff:fe0d:5a54.36767: sctp
1) [INIT ACK] [init tag: 747759530] [rwnd: 62464] [OS: 10] [MIS: 10]
Moreover, Alan says:
This problem was seen with both Racoon and Racoon2. Other people have seen
this with OpenSwan. When IPsec is configured to encrypt all upper layer
protocols the SCTP connection does not initialize. After using Wireshark to
follow packets, this is because the SCTP packet leaves Box A unencrypted and
Box B believes all upper layer protocols are to be encrypted so it drops
this packet, causing the SCTP connection to fail to initialize. When IPsec
is configured to encrypt just SCTP, the SCTP packets are observed unencrypted.
In fact, using `socat sctp6-listen:3333 -` on one end and transferring "plaintext"
string on the other end, results in cleartext on the wire where SCTP eventually
does not report any errors, thus in the latter case that Alan reports, the
non-paranoid user might think he's communicating over an encrypted transport on
SCTP although he's not (tcpdump ... -X):
...
0x0030: 5d70 8e1a 0003 001a 177d eb6c 0000 0000 ]p.......}.l....
0x0040: 0000 0000 706c 6169 6e74 6578 740a 0000 ....plaintext...
Only in /proc/net/xfrm\_stat we can see XfrmInTmplMismatch increasing on the
receiver side. Initial follow-up analysis from Alan's bug report was done by
Alexey Dobriyan. Also thanks to Vlad Yasevich for feedback on this.
SCTP has its own implementation of sctp\_v6\_xmit() not calling inet6\_csk\_xmit().
This has the implication that it probably never really got updated along with
changes in inet6\_csk\_xmit() and therefore does not seem to invoke xfrm handlers.
SCTP's IPv4 xmit however, properly calls ip\_queue\_xmit() to do the work. Since
a call to inet6\_csk\_xmit() would solve this problem, but result in unecessary
route lookups, let us just use the cached flowi6 instead that we got through
sctp\_v6\_get\_dst(). Since all SCTP packets are being sent through sctp\_packet\_transmit(),
we do the route lookup / flow caching in sctp\_transport\_route(), hold it in
tp->dst and skb\_dst\_set() right after that. If we would alter fl6->daddr in
sctp\_v6\_xmit() to np->opt->srcrt, we possibly could run into the same effect
of not having xfrm layer pick it up, hence, use fl6\_update\_dst() in sctp\_v6\_get\_dst()
instead to get the correct source routed dst entry, which we assign to the skb.
Also source address routing example from 625034113 ("sctp: fix sctp to work with
ipv6 source address routing") still works with this patch! Nevertheless, in RFC5095
it is actually 'recommended' to not use that anyway due to traffic amplification [1].
So it seems we're not supposed to do that anyway in sctp\_v6\_xmit(). Moreover, if
we overwrite the flow destination here, the lower IPv6 layer will be unable to
put the correct destination address into IP header, as routing header is added in
ipv6\_push\_nfrag\_opts() but then probably with wrong final destination. Things aside,
result of this patch is that we do not have any XfrmInTmplMismatch increase plus on
the wire with this patch it now looks like:
SCTP + IPv6:
08:17:47.074080 IP6 2620:52:0:102f:7a2b:cbff:fe27:1b0a > 2620:52:0:102f:213:72ff:fe32:7eba:
AH(spi=0x00005fb4,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00005fb5,seq=0x1), length 72
08:17:47.074264 IP6 2620:52:0:102f:213:72ff:fe32:7eba > 2620:52:0:102f:7a2b:cbff:fe27:1b0a:
AH(spi=0x00003d54,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00003d55,seq=0x1), length 296
This fixes Kernel Bugzilla 24412. This security issue seems to be present since
2.6.18 kernels. Lets just hope some big passive adversary in the wild didn't have
its fun with that. lksctp-tools IPv6 regression test suite passes as well with
this patch.

[ Upstream commit d0fe8c888b1fd1a2f84b9962cabcb98a70988aec ]
I've been hitting a NULL ptr deref while using netconsole because the
np->dev check and the pointer manipulation in netpoll\_cleanup are done
without rtnl and the following sequence happens when having a netconsole
over a vlan and we remove the vlan while disabling the netconsole:
CPU 1 CPU2
removes vlan and calls the notifier
enters store\_enabled(), calls
netdev\_cleanup which checks np->dev
and then waits for rtnl
executes the netconsole netdev
release notifier making np->dev
== NULL and releases rtnl
continues to dereference a member of
np->dev which at this point is == NULL

In commit 8ed781668dd49 ("flow\_keys: include thoff into flow\_keys for

temporary variable that could not always contain transport header
offset.
This is not a problem for TCP/UDP because port offset (@poff)

Alexander renamed the variables but forgot to change sk\_tx\_queue\_set()

net: sctp: fix smatch warning in sctp\_send\_asconf\_del\_ip
[ Upstream commit 88362ad8f9a6cea787420b57cc27ccacef000dbe ]
This was originally reported in [1] and posted by Neil Horman [2], he said:
Fix up a missed null pointer check in the asconf code. If we don't find
a local address, but we pass in an address length of more than 1, we may
dereference a NULL laddr pointer. Currently this can't happen, as the only
users of the function pass in the value 1 as the addrcnt parameter, but
its not hot path, and it doesn't hurt to check for NULL should that ever
be the case.
The callpath from sctp\_asconf\_mgmt() looks okay. But this could be triggered
from sctp\_setsockopt\_bindx() call with SCTP\_BINDX\_REM\_ADDR and addrcnt > 1
while passing all possible addresses from the bind list to SCTP\_BINDX\_REM\_ADDR
so that we do \*not\* find a single address in the association's bind address
list that is not in the packed array of addresses. If this happens when we
have an established association with ASCONF-capable peers, then we could get
a NULL pointer dereference as we only check for laddr == NULL && addrcnt == 1
and call later sctp\_make\_asconf\_update\_ip() with NULL laddr.
BUT: this actually won't happen as sctp\_bindx\_rem() will catch such a case
and return with an error earlier. As this is incredably unintuitive and error
prone, add a check to catch at least future bugs here. As Neil says, its not
hot path. Introduced by 8a07eb0a5 ("sctp: Add ASCONF operation on the
single-homed host").

net: fib: fib6\_add: fix potential NULL pointer dereference
[ Upstream commit ae7b4e1f213aa659aedf9c6ecad0bf5f0476e1e2 ]
When the kernel is compiled with CONFIG\_IPV6\_SUBTREES, and we return
with an error in fn = fib6\_add\_1(), then error codes are encoded into
the return pointer e.g. ERR\_PTR(-ENOENT). In such an error case, we
write the error code into err and jump to out, hence enter the if(err)
condition. Now, if CONFIG\_IPV6\_SUBTREES is enabled, we check for:
if (pn != fn && pn->leaf == rt)
...
if (pn != fn && !pn->leaf && !(pn->fn\_flags & RTN\_RTINFO))
...
Since pn is NULL and fn is f.e. ERR\_PTR(-ENOENT), then pn != fn
evaluates to true and causes a NULL-pointer dereference on further
checks on pn. Fix it, by setting both NULL in error case, so that
pn != fn already evaluates to false and no further dereference
takes place.
This was first correctly implemented in 4a287eba2 ("IPv6 routing,
NLM\_F\_\* flag support: REPLACE and EXCL flags support, warn about
missing CREATE flag"), but the bug got later on introduced by
188c517a0 ("ipv6: return errno pointers consistently for fib6\_add\_1()").

sh\_eth: fix napi\_{en|dis}able() calls racing against interrupts
[ Upstream commit d2779e99468fd83ef1493c34f3803fec9aad8345 ]
While implementing NAPI for the driver, I overlooked the race conditions where
interrupt handler might have called napi\_schedule\_prep() before napi\_enable()
was called or after napi\_disable() was called. If RX interrupt happens, this
would cause the endless interrupts and messages like:
sh-eth eth0: ignoring interrupt, status 0x00040000, mask 0x01ff009f.
The interrupt wouldn't even be masked by the kernel eventually since the handler
would return IRQ\_HANDLED all the time.
As a fix, move napi\_enable() call before request\_irq() call and napi\_disable()
call after free\_irq() call.

HID: fix data access in implement()
commit 27ce405039bfe6d3f4143415c638f56a3df77dca upstream.
implement() is setting bytes in LE data stream. In case the data is not
aligned to 64bits, it reads past the allocated buffer. It doesn't really
change any value there (it's properly bitmasked), but in case that this
read past the boundary hits a page boundary, pagefault happens when
accessing 64bits of 'x' in implement(), and kernel oopses.
This happens much more often when numbered reports are in use, as the
initial 8bit skip in the buffer makes the whole process work on values
which are not aligned to 64bits.
This problem dates back to attempts in 2005 and 2006 to make implement()
and extract() as generic as possible, and even back then the problem
was realized by Adam Kroperlin, but falsely assumed to be impossible
to cause any harm:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg47690.html
I have made several attempts at fixing it "on the spot" directly in
implement(), but the results were horrible; the special casing for processing
last 64bit chunk and switching to different math makes it unreadable mess.
I therefore took a path to allocate a few bytes more which will never make
it into final report, but are there as a cushion for all the 64bit math
operations happening in implement() and extract().
All callers of hid\_output\_report() are converted at the same time to allocate
the buffer by newly introduced hid\_alloc\_report\_buf() helper.
Bruno noticed that the whole raw\_size test can be dropped as well, as
hid\_alloc\_report\_buf() makes sure that the buffer is always of a proper
size.

nfsd4: fix leak of inode reference on delegation failure
commit bf7bd3e98be5c74813bee6ad496139fb0a011b3b upstream.
This fixes a regression from 68a3396178e6688ad7367202cdf0af8ed03c8727
"nfsd4: shut down more of delegation earlier".
After that commit, nfs4\_set\_delegation() failures result in
nfs4\_put\_delegation being called, but nfs4\_put\_delegation doesn't free
the nfs4\_file that has already been set by alloc\_init\_deleg().
This can result in an oops on later unmounting the exported filesystem.
Note also delaying the fi\_had\_conflict check we're able to return a
better error (hence give 4.1 clients a better idea why the delegation
failed; though note CONFLICT isn't an exact match here, as that's
supposed to indicate a current conflict, but all we know here is that
there was one recently).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1039054#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-12-06 13:29:52 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the IPv6 protocol(CONFIG_IPv6) along with the IPv6 source address based routing support(CONFIG_IPV6_SUBTREE) is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw. It could occur while doing an ioctl(SIOCADDRT) call on an IPv6 socket. User would need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to perform such a call.  A user/program with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges could use this flaw to crash a system resulting in DoS.  Upstream fix: -------------  -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/ae7b4e1f213aa659aedf9c6ecad0bf5f0476e1e2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1039054#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2013-12-06 14:13:51 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1039054#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-28 17:41:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2014:0100 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0100.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

net: fib: fib6\_add: fix potential NULL pointer dereference

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/ae7b4e1f213aa659aedf9c6ecad0bf5f0476e1e2)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
When the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_IPV6_SUBTREES, and we return
with an error in fn = fib6_add_1(), then error codes are encoded into
the return pointer e.g. ERR_PTR(-ENOENT). In such an error case, we
write the error code into err and jump to out, hence enter the if(err)
condition. Now, if CONFIG_IPV6_SUBTREES is enabled, we check for:

  if (pn != fn && pn->leaf == rt)
    ...
  if (pn != fn && !pn->leaf && !(pn->fn_flags & RTN_RTINFO))
    ...

Since pn is NULL and fn is f.e. ERR_PTR(-ENOENT), then pn != fn
evaluates to true and causes a NULL-pointer dereference on further
checks on pn. Fix it, by setting both NULL in error case, so that
pn != fn already evaluates to false and no further dereference
takes place.

This was first correctly implemented in [4a287eb](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/4a287eba2de395713d8b2b2aeaa69fa086832d34) ("IPv6 routing,
NLM_F_* flag support: REPLACE and EXCL flags support, warn about
missing CREATE flag"), but the bug got later on introduced by
[188c517](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/188c517a050ec5b123e72cab76ea213721e5bd9d) ("ipv6: return errno pointers consistently for fib6_add_1()").

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0100)

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite

implementation handled sending of certain UDP packets over sockets that
used the UDP\_CORK option when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) feature
was enabled on the output device. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4470, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the perf\_trace\_event\_perm() function in the

Linux kernel checked permissions for the function tracer functionality.
An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to enable function tracing
and cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2013-2930, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the net\_ctl\_permissions() function in the

Linux kernel checked access permissions. A local, unprivileged user could
potentially use this flaw to access certain files in /proc/sys/net
regardless of the underlying file system permissions. (CVE-2013-4270,
Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Adaptec RAID controller

(aacraid) checked permissions of compat IOCTLs. A local attacker could use
this flaw to bypass intended security restrictions. (CVE-2013-6383,
Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the get\_dumpable() function return value was

interpreted in the ptrace subsystem of the Linux kernel. When
'fs.suid\_dumpable' was set to 2, a local, unprivileged local user could
use this flaw to bypass intended ptrace restrictions and obtain
potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-2929, Low)

* An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in the Marvell 8xxx

Libertas WLAN (libertas) driver in the Linux kernel. A local user able to
write to a file that is provided by the libertas driver and located on the
debug file system (debugfs) could use this flaw to crash the system. Note:
The debugfs file system must be mounted locally to exploit this issue.
It is not mounted by default. (CVE-2013-6378, Low)

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IPv6

source address-based routing implementation. A local attacker who has the
CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could use this flaw to crash the system.
(CVE-2013-6431, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Hannes Frederic Sowa for reporting
CVE-2013-4470. The CVE-2013-4270 issue was discovered by Miroslav Vadkerti
of Red Hat.

This update also fixes multiple bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
kernel to version kernel-rt-3.8.13-rt27, correct these issues, and fix the
bugs noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes. The system must
be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.
