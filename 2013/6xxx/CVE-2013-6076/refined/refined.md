-  The vulnerability cannot be used for code injection or other attacks beyond DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted IKEv1 fragmentation payload to a vulnerable strongSwan instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a vulnerable strongSwan system.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malformed IKEv1 fragmentation packet.
- The strongSwan system needs to have an IKEv1 or mixed IKEv1/IKEv2 connection configured.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects strongSwan versions 5.0.2 up to 5.1.0.
- A patch is available for older releases, and the vulnerability is fixed in strongSwan 5.1.1.
