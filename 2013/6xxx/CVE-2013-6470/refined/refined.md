    "root_cause": "The Qpid configuration created by openstack-foreman-installer did not have authentication enabled when run with default settings in standalone mode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default configuration",
      "Lack of authentication on Qpid service"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker able to establish a TCP connection to Qpid could access any OpenStack back end using Qpid (for example, nova) without any authentication, potentially leading to full compromise of the OpenStack environment.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to Qpid service"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the Qpid service on the target system."
