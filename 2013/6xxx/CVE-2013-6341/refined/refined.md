Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6341

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the "language" HTTP GET parameter passed to the `/index.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Control:** A successful exploit allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This grants them complete control over the vulnerable web application and its database.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the "language" parameter in a crafted HTTP GET request to `/index.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any prior access to the application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Example Exploit:**
The provided example demonstrates how an attacker could retrieve the MySQL server version:
`http://[host]/index.php?language=0%27%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,version%28%29,6,7,8%20--%202`

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Dokeos version 2.2 RC2 and likely prior versions.
- The vulnerability was discovered by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab.
- The vendor did not provide a fix, and an unofficial patch was developed by the discoverers.
- The CVSSv2 base score is 7.5, indicating a high risk.
