# ZENworks Configuration Management 11.2.4 - update information and list of fixes

* **Document ID:***7012027*
* **Creation Date:**26-Mar-2013
* **Modified Date:**28-Jul-2015
* + **Micro Focus Products:**ZENworks Asset ManagementZENworks Configuration ManagementZENworks Endpoint Security ManagementZENworks Full Disk EncryptionZENworks Patch Management

## Environment

 Novell ZENworks Asset Management 11.2
Novell ZENworks Configuration Management 11.2
Novell ZENworks Endpoint Security Management 11.1
Novell ZENworks Full Disk Encryption
Novell ZENworks Patch Management 11.2

## Resolution

 28 October 2013 - ZENworks Configuration Management 11.2.4

**ZCM 11.2.4 can be downloaded from <https://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=ZCUFlvDkC9w~>**

Data regarding GUID, version numbers etc., can be found in the file *11.2.4\_Version\_Data.pdf* available at the above location. **Note that this update does not appear when "Check for Updates" is done in ZCC, for the same reasons as shown in [TID 7010390 Agent service is not running after applying the ZENworks 11.2.1 update](/kb/doc.php?id=7010390)
- the same problem could occur if 11.2.4 is made available via that
mechanism, so until a fix can be made to the System Update code, large
updates will only be made via zip files.**

Information regarding the prerequisites for upgrading to this version is contained in the readme for ZCM 11.2.4 at
<https://www.novell.com/documentation/zenworks11/readme_zenworks1124/data/readme_zenworks1124.html>

See [TID 7010466 ZCM 10.3.x device fails to upgrade to ZCM 11.2.x](/kb/doc.php?id=7010466) for issues that can arise if the agent pre-requisites are not met.
