Is horrible even if you uninstall it will leave you a lot of bugs… I can’t make ads in google because of that plugin.

I used this plugin for some years, and the plugin has so many bugs and a odd way to add features in wordpress. The support ends in 2019. So, there is no chance to keep using this…
So, I had to create my own plugin. All features I need is working now and my site increase speed.

Difficult to install, full of ads, no usage instructions, rubbish results. Avoid!

### [Garbage](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/garbage-81/)

[Ed G](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ed-g/ "Posts by Ed G")
August 4, 2018

The formatting is incorrect. My logo on the Svbtle template overflows the logo area. Trying to launch the visual editor or delete a landing page emits several warning messages. There’s no readily apparent way to delete a variation. Obviously, this plugin is no longer supported by the company and doesn’t work well with WP 4.9 or above.

This Plugin is useless, the formatting does not work and the plugins are ugly and buggy.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
