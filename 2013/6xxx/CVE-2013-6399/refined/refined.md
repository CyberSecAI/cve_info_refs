{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `vdev->queue_sel` value, read from the savevm data stream during migration, is used as an index into the `vdev->vq[]` array without proper bounds checking. If `vdev->queue_sel` exceeds the array's length, subsequent PIO operations like `VIRTIO_PCI_QUEUE_PFN` can lead to a buffer overrun.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking on the `vdev->queue_sel` value during migration.",
      "Use of an unchecked index to access an array, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation could corrupt QEMU process memory on the destination host, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process. An attacker can alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the network during migration).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Altering savevm data either on the disk or during migration over the network."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the savevm data either on disk or during the migration process over the wire, which may include a privileged user or someone that has access to the storage or network during migration."
