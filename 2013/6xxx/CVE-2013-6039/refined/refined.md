Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- The application fails to properly neutralize user-supplied input within the `txtSearch` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Reflected XSS (CWE-79): The application directly reflects unvalidated input from the `txtSearch` parameter in the output HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary HTML, including malicious scripts, into the user's browser session.
- This could lead to:
    - Information leakage.
    - Privilege escalation (if the attacker can manipulate user actions within the application).
    - Denial of service (through malicious script execution).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `txtSearch` parameter in the URL.
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the payload within the `txtSearch` parameter.
- The victim would need to interact with this malicious URL (e.g., by clicking on a link).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to get the victim to interact with this URL.
- No prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Details**
- Affected versions: NagiosQL 3.2 Service Pack 2 and possibly earlier versions.
- A security hotfix has been released to address the vulnerability.
