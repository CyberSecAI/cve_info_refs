Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-6734:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the WebSphere eXtreme Scale Client, specifically how it handles cached HTTP session data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Session Data Caching:** The WebSphere eXtreme Scale Client, in certain configurations, might allow cached HTTP session data belonging to one user to be accessed by another user who is accessing the same web container. This indicates a flaw in how session data is isolated or keyed for different users within the cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Session Data Exposure:** A malicious user could gain access to the cached HTTP session data of another user. This could include sensitive information stored within the session, such as authentication tokens, user preferences, or other private data.
- **Potential Account Impersonation:** Depending on the session data's nature, an attacker might be able to impersonate a legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves users accessing a web application that uses WebSphere eXtreme Scale for HTTP session management.
- The vulnerability is triggered when multiple users access the same web container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a user of the same web application and accessing the same web container as the victim.
- No special privileges are mentioned, suggesting that the vulnerability can be exploited by a regular user with network access to the affected service.

**Additional Notes:**

- A temporary workaround involves disabling caching on servers located in front of the WebSphere eXtreme Scale server.
- Patches (Interim Fixes and Fix Packs) are available for affected versions of WebSphere eXtreme Scale and WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance.
- The vulnerability is addressed through the program change associated with APAR PI06341.
