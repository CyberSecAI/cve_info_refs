{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Exceed OnDemand client, by default, uses anonymous SSL ciphers when connecting to the server. This lack of server authentication allows an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of anonymous SSL ciphers",
      "Lack of server authentication"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can intercept and modify traffic between the client and server. This can lead to credentials disclosure, authentication bypass, and lack of connection confidentiality and integrity.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack using techniques like ARP poisoning, DNS hijacking, or a rogue access point."
    ],
   "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the TCP traffic between the Exceed OnDemand client and server."
