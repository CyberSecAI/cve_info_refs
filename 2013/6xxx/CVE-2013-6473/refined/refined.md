Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-6473:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the `urftopdf` filter of `cups-filters`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Heap-based buffer overflows occur when processing a URF file, specifically due to a large page or line within the file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the "lp" user. This could potentially lead to system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Processing a maliciously crafted URF file with the `urftopdf` filter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious URF file to a system that uses the vulnerable `cups-filters` package. This could be done by:
    *   Submitting a print job containing a crafted URF file.
    *   Having the file processed by any other service that utilizes the `urftopdf` filter.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `cups-filters` versions before 1.0.47.
*   The `urftopdf` filter was introduced in `cups-filters` version 1.0.25.
*   The `cups` package in Debian oldstable (squeeze) is affected because it contained the vulnerable filter in `debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/pdftoopvp`.
*   The `cups-filters` package in Debian stable (wheezy) is affected as well.
*   Patches for this vulnerability were included in `cups-filters` version 1.0.47 and later, and backported to older distributions.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.
