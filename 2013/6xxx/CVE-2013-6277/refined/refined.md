Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6277:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flawed firmware building procedure that inadvertently leaves multiple unauthorized SSH public keys within the `authorized_keys` file of QNAP products. These keys grant access to individuals possessing the corresponding private keys. Specifically, the procedure results in the inclusion of  'rsa-key-20020513', 'rudy@mars', and three @localhost.localdomain keys.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code**: The inclusion of these keys suggests a failure to remove debugging or testing artifacts from the final production firmware.
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials**: The presence of specific pre-defined public keys implies that corresponding private keys likely exist, and could be used as hardcoded credentials for unauthorized access.
- **CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password**: While not a password in the traditional sense, these keys act as hardcoded authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers possessing the private keys corresponding to the hardcoded public keys in the `authorized_keys` file can gain unauthorized remote access to the affected devices.
- **Backdoor**: The presence of these keys effectively creates a backdoor, allowing persistent and covert access.
- **Data Breach/Compromise**: Once access is gained, an attacker can potentially compromise the device, steal data, or use it as a launching point for further attacks.
- **Private Key Theft**: The owners of these private keys also become targets themselves as someone can potentially steal those keys to gain access to other users' systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Access**: Attackers need network connectivity to the vulnerable device in order to leverage the SSH service to gain unauthorized access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Private Key Ownership**: The attacker must possess at least one of the private keys corresponding to the public keys found in the `authorized_keys` file.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable QNAP device, and the device must have the SSH service running.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple QNAP products, including VioCard-30, VioGate-340, and VioCard-100/300.
- The vendor initially stated they would not fix the issue, citing that these issues only happened in specific old models and that the keys are not present on their servers.
- The discoverer of the vulnerability recommends removing the `authorized_keys` file in a fixed firmware update.
- CVE-2013-6277 specifically covers the scenario where the keys 'rsa-key-20020513', 'rudy@mars', and three @localhost.localdomain keys are present in `authorized_keys`.  CVE-2013-6276 covers the case where only 'rsa-key-20020513' and 'rudy@mars' are present.
