## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

There didn't seem to be further discussion of this, and the public
vendor references don't yet have CVE IDs, so we are assigning these:

CVE-2013-6166 <https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=238041>
CVE-2013-6167 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=858215>

And the problem is? Browser sends bad request and lighty sends "400 bad request" response. Seems like correct behaviour to me.

I found a place where status 400 is set. In request.c starting at line 1047:
```

default:
  if (*cur >= 0 && *cur < 32 && *cur != '\t') {
    if (srv->srvconf.log_request_header_on_error) {
      log_error_write(srv, __FILE__, __LINE__, "sds",
                      "invalid char in header", (int)*cur, "-> 400");
    }

    con->http_status = 400;
    con->keep_alive = 0;

    return 0;
  }
  break;
}

```

In my case `*char` equals to ASCII char with code 5. I excluded it from <0, 32> condition. No 400 now.
Can someone tell me is there any exposure in my solution?

Character 5 is a control character and shouldn't be in a http header.

What is the reason to reject control character from header value field?
Is there some specification that disallow it, or is it because the server can't handle control characters in futher processing?

* **Status** changed from *Invalid* to *Reopened*

Almost every site has installed google analytics code. This code sets some cookies specific for campaign tracking. This mechanism can be used to set any value for this cookie. Look at this url:

[www.domain.com/?utm\_source=test&utm\_medium=test&utm\_campaign=te%05st](http://www.domain.com/?utm_source=test&utm_medium=test&utm_campaign=te%05st)

when google analytics is installed on the site it will set cookie with parameters present in this url. Look at the last one. There is special character number 5 which will be saved in the cookie. Next, any requests from this visitor to this domain will end up with 400 Bad request error.

This mechanism may be used to ban the page to it's visitors. Some atacker may share this buggy link with others and the site may be blocked for many many people (!!!).

I think that you shouldn't block the request when cookie contains some control characters. It is completely legal and possible by scripts to save such character in the cookie - so you shouldn't block it.

I had to change the sources of lighttpd and compile it today because some versions of some browsers (ex. IE, Firefox) changed polish specific letter "?" into control character number 5. This character was saved in cookie and website was blocked for many many people. The same mechanism may be used by atackers.

The RFCs are pretty clear: CTL chars are not allowed. The current [draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-21#section-3.2) is also easy to read.

There is also a security aspect of this - allowing CTL chars might lead to new security issues.

So just stop tracking your users with google analytics, or tell google to fix it (or both). It might also be a good idea to tell browser vendors not to accept broken cookies.

Being compliant with specification is good but despite the specification there is also a normal life.
If saving special chars in cookies is possible and all browser allows for it lighttpd should handle such cookies.
There are some clever things that lighttpd may do. It may simply delete such chars or delete this one header containing this char etc.

But it is very bad idea to simply send "Bad Request" and ban a website for many many users. Maybe there should be some configuration directive telling what to do in such situation?

I checked other web servers and they accept cookies with special chars and there i no error.

Hahaha... I want to see when Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Apple, Opera etc. will listen to this advice.

We need to exploit it and then report critical security bug to Google, Mozilla etc. :)
Or add some option to lighttpd configuration to allow CTL chars in cookie values if we can't exploit it.

All this sites comes from the list of websites powered by lighty (<http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/PoweredByLighttpd>)

I think that owners of this websites wouldn't be happy if they have been banned for millions of visitors.

I tried some weeks ago and couldn't reproduce it with any of those links - perhaps analytics got fixed.
With JavaScript I still could set broken cookies (funny enough they don't like "\r" or "\n", so there seems to be some kind of check already).

The question here doesn't seem to make sense in this context.

The "browser document.cookie DoS" doesn't cause anything to crash. Our
Tuesday message in this thread was addressed to Murray McAllister, who
brought up the related issue of whether Firefox crashes should have
CVE assignments. That message of ours apparently contributed to the
mixup.

Very roughly, "browser document.cookie DoS" is a behavior, found in
multiple web browsers, that lets attackers perform the equivalent of a
Logout CSRF attack against many web sites.

In a "normal" Logout CSRF scenario, the browser sends a request to
(for example) /logout.php, and the web application interprets (or
"misinterprets") this to mean that the client user actually wishes to
be logged out. The web application might then change the state of
something on the server side to indicate that the user is logged out.

In this Logout CSRF variant, the browser doesn't send a request to
/logout.php and instead sends a request to someplace else, such as the
/ URI, with parameters to force a web application to set a malformed
cookie within the response. At the web-application layer, nothing
happens to log out the user. However, at the HTTP server level, the
user can be effectively logged out, because the HTTP server isn't
wiling to accept requests with malformed Cookie request headers.
What's even worse is that this is a Persistent Logout CSRF variant, in
the sense that the user cannot login again without restarting the web
browser.

(Yes, we realize that this isn't exactly like Logout CSRF, because the
behavior also prevents visiting unrestricted static pages, which
almost always would remain accessible after a "real" logout. Logout
CSRF just seemed to be the simplest model for describing the problem.)

It seems fairly clear that the web browsers can be blamed for the
problem, because they should not be sending the malformed Cookie
headers at all. When the web browser sends the malformed Cookie
header, it is (in effect) enabling a Logout CSRF vulnerability on a
web site that does not have any server-side Logout CSRF problem.

In addition, it would sometimes also be possible to blame code on the
server side, which should not be trying to set a malformed cookie. In
the case of Google Analytics, maybe the server-side issue is
site-specific on the *.google-analytics.com servers, and therefore
outside the scope of CVE.

One might also argue that an HTTP server (such as lighttpd) shouldn't
completely block access to the site upon seeing a malformed Cookie
header. That's not necessarily a vulnerability, though.

For now, it seems simplest to assign CVEs on this basis:

  - at least two independently implemented web browsers are capable of
    sending malformed Cookie headers that trigger the lighttpd
    request.c "invalid char in header" code, leading to the 400 HTTP
    status code

  - yes, it can be considered an interaction error between the browser
    and lighttpd

  - however, enough blame belongs to the browser that there should be
    one CVE assigned per independent browser implementation

From: Stefan Bühler <stbuehler@lighttpd.net>
To: oss-security@lists.openwall.com
Subject: [oss-security] browser document.cookie DoS vulnerability
Hi,
Chromium 25.0.1364.160 (debian testing), Iceweasel/Firefox 19 and
probably many other browsers allow javascript to set broken cookie
values, leading to possible permanent "400 Bad Request" responses. The
broken value might be set by 3rd party libraries.
For example the google analytics code is vulnerable, as it sets cookie
values based on parameters in the referer query string. lighttpd does
not allow control characters in http header values, so any lighttpd
site using google analytics is vulnerable if you can get the user to
follow a link (img tag for example) to that site like this:
<http://www.example.com/?utm_source=test&utm_medium=test&utm_campaign=te%05st>
Afaik apache doesn't check the cookie values (or perhaps removes the
broken characters). Imho they are responsible for this mess :)
To be clear: the bug is in the browser / javascript implementation:
document.cookie MUST NOT allow cookie values which include certain
control characters. Javascript applications should not use 8-bit
characters.
(If browser vendors want to allow broken cookie values to be stored,
they MUST NOT send them to the server; in this case javascript
applications can still read the broken values. But I don't think this
is a good idea.)
The safe character set for HTTP header values is: %x20-7E; %x80-FF is
obsoleted by the current draft.
"A recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before
interpreting the field value", so horizontal tabs are not "safe" - they
might get converted to a space, but are not forbidden (also multiple
spaces can get replaced by a single one).
I think this could use a CVE.
The problem was reported in our lighttpd bug tracker:
<http://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2188>
Kind regards,
Stefan
Testing the bug:
Try one of the listed urls in the ticket (the error should trigger
after a reload). If you have noscript, request policy, referer control
or similar stuff running you are probably safe; to test the bug in this
case you need a Javascript console on a lighttpd site
(<http://lighttpd.net> for example), and enter:
document.cookie = "foo=bar\x05test"
Try to reload the page - it should return a 400 Bad Request page now.
document.cookie = "foo="
And it should work again.
HTTP references:
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616>
message-header = field-name ":" [ field-value ]
field-name = token
field-value = \*( field-content | LWS )

The "vulnerability" here is just a DOS attack, right? You can't actually go creating a well-formed request with arbitrary HTTP headers or anything like that?
This sounds like a sec-dos that we should just make public.
I suspect that throwing when a bad character was added via the DOM would be a compatibility nightmare, but could maybe try %-escaping the disallowed characters or something...Component: DOM → Networking: Cookies

chromium just fixed this bug in their browser:

firefox should probably also fix it.

I reproduced the bug loading a certain web page with the URL /?utm\_source=test&utm\_medium=test&utm\_campaign=te%05st to create the DOS cookie. Attempt to load any page on that domain fails from then on.
I wrote a fix that rejects the DOS cookies which contain control codes similar to the fix that chrome uses <http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/cookies/parsed_cookie.cc?r1=224268&r2=224267&pathrev=224268>

Yes, that choice was made purposefully (given breakage of tests indicating potential real-world breakage) if we also disable via document.cookie. Additionally, in testing, other browsers behaved the same way, so this has compatibility concerns, as well.Flags: needinfo?(hurley)

FYI, recently, Chrome patched this bug completely: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1174647#c9>

Also, Safari already doesn't store control characters in Cookie.

In modern browsers, only Firefox stores them via document.cookie and still has this DoS issue. I think it's time to re-open this issue.

Subject: browser document.cookie DoS vulnerability

Hi,

Chromium 25.0.1364.160 (debian testing), Iceweasel/Firefox 19 and
probably many other browsers allow javascript to set broken cookie
values, leading to possible permanent "400 Bad Request" responses. The
broken value might be set by 3rd party libraries.

For example the google analytics code is vulnerable, as it sets cookie
values based on parameters in the referer query string. lighttpd does
not allow control characters in http header values, so any lighttpd
site using google analytics is vulnerable if you can get the user to
follow a link (img tag for example) to that site like this:

<http://www.example.com/?utm_source=test&utm_medium=test&utm_campaign=te%05st>

Afaik apache doesn't check the cookie values (or perhaps removes the
broken characters). Imho they are responsible for this mess :)

To be clear: the bug is in the browser / javascript implementation:

document.cookie MUST NOT allow cookie values which include certain
control characters. Javascript applications should not use 8-bit
characters.

(If browser vendors want to allow broken cookie values to be stored,
they MUST NOT send them to the server; in this case javascript
applications can still read the broken values. But I don't think this
is a good idea.)

The safe character set for HTTP header values is: %x20-7E; %x80-FF is
obsoleted by the current draft.

"A recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before
interpreting the field value", so horizontal tabs are not "safe" - they
might get converted to a space, but are not forbidden (also multiple
spaces can get replaced by a single one).

I think this could use a CVE.

The problem was reported in our lighttpd bug tracker:
<http://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2188>

Kind regards,
Stefan

Testing the bug:

Try one of the listed urls in the ticket (the error should trigger
after a reload). If you have noscript, request policy, referer control
or similar stuff running you are probably safe; to test the bug in this
case you need a Javascript console on a lighttpd site
(<http://lighttpd.net> for example), and enter:

> document.cookie = "foo=bar\x05test"
Try to reload the page - it should return a 400 Bad Request page now.

> document.cookie = "foo="
And it should work again.
