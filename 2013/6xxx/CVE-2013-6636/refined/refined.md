Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-6636:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an address bar spoofing issue related to modal dialogs in the Chromium web browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Address bar spoofing is the core vulnerability. This implies that an attacker could manipulate the displayed URL in the browser's address bar, leading the user to believe they are on a legitimate site when, in fact, they are on a malicious one. The specific mechanism for achieving this involves modal dialogs, indicating an interaction between how these dialogs are handled and how the address bar is updated/displayed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform address bar spoofing. This could lead to:
*   Phishing attacks, where users are tricked into entering sensitive information on a fake website that appears legitimate.
*   Malware distribution, where users are tricked into downloading malicious software.
*   General confusion and loss of trust, as users might become unsure of the websites they are visiting.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the display of a modal dialog, which allows an attacker to manipulate the displayed address bar of the browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to control or influence the content being displayed to the user such that a modal dialog can be triggered in a way that leads to address bar spoofing. This typically implies an ability to inject or control code within the context of a webpage or some other form of influence over the browser's UI.

**Additional notes:**
The provided content indicates this vulnerability is fixed in Chromium version 31.0.1650.63. The issue is also referenced in multiple openSUSE security updates and a Debian security advisory, indicating it was a widespread concern. This issue was also credited to Bas Venis who was awarded $500 by Google.
