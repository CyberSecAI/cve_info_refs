The provided content relates to CVE-2013-6312.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a file or path name vulnerability in IBM Rational Performance Tester and IBM Rational Service Tester. This vulnerability potentially allows access to system files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is described as a file or path name vulnerability, which suggests a lack of proper input sanitization or validation when handling file paths. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate file paths and access unintended files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability allows access to system files. The specific impact will depend on the system files that can be accessed by exploiting the vulnerability. This may lead to information disclosure or further system compromise depending on the files accessed.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through manipulating file paths within the application's functionality. This means an attacker would have to interact with the software in a way that causes it to handle file paths, which are then interpreted in an unsafe manner.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to interact with the vulnerable application, either locally or remotely, and the knowledge/ability to manipulate file paths to access unintended system files.
