# Security Bulletin: Addressing a Vulnerability in YUI 2.5.0 through YUI 2.9.0

## Overview

**November 11, 2013** -- A security vulnerability was discovered by [@soiaxx](https://twitter.com/soiaxx) in YUI 2 involving self-hosted `uploader.swf` files. This vulnerability impacts YUI 2 versions **2.5.0** through **2.9.0** and allows arbitrary JavaScript to be run by passing in a query string parameter such as this one:

`uploader.swf?allowedDomain=\%22}%29%29%29}catch%28e%29{alert%28document.domain%29;}//`

This problem is not reproducible in YUI 3.

## Resolution

If you are using or even merely hosting any YUI 2 `.swf` file, please take steps to remove these files immediately from your hosts.

YUI 2 is an [end-of-lifed project](http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2011/04/13/announcing-yui-2-9-0/) and is no longer supported. All YUI 2 `.swf` files have been removed from the Yahoo CDN. If your site was taking advantage of the presence of these files on the Yahoo CDN they will no longer be available.

## Support

Our [Security and YUI page](/security/) has information about how to contact us for security-related issues.
