Subject: [OSSA 2014-005] Missing SSL certificate check in Python Swift client
 (CVE-2013-6396)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-005
CVE: CVE-2013-6396
Date: February 17, 2014
Title: Missing SSL certificate check in Python Swift client
Reporter: Thomas Leaman (HP)
Products: python-swiftclient
Versions: 1.0 version up to 1.9.0

Description:
Thomas Leaman from HP reported that the Python Swift client was failing
to properly check certificates during the establishment of HTTPS
connections. A remote attacker with access over segments of the network
between client and server could potentially set up a man-in-the-middle
attack and access the contents of the Swift client's communication with
the server, including any used credentials.

python-swiftclient fix (included in 2.0 release):
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/69187>

### Bug Description

Thomas Leaman (HP) reported in public [bug 1192229](/bugs/1192229) that the Swift python client does not perform any kind of SSL certificate validation, which makes it vulnerable to MiM attacks.

This bug was filed to track this specific issue.

@fungi: your take on this one ? Since it's client-side I would classify as a vulnerability, although it's hardly a surprise.

Sidenote: we should more aggressively request CVEs for public vulnerabilities, even if the patch isn't there yet.

Yes, this clearly needs an advisory (lack of validation, enabling credential and content disclosure to a MitM attacker).

Is someone actively reviewing the patch for this ( <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/33473/> )?

It seems to have been sitting untouched for a while now.

Title: Missing SSL certificate check in Python Swift client

Reporter: Thomas Leaman (HP)

Products: python-swiftclient

Affects: All versions

Description:

Thomas Leaman from HP reported that the Python Swift client was failing to properly check certificates during the establishment of HTTPS connections. A remote attacker with access over segments of the network between client and server could potentially set up a man-in-the-middle attack and access the contents of the Swift client request (or response).

Impact desc looks good.

Was wondering though: Once the MiM setup captures the token, couldn't it reuse it for full account access and profit ?

Thierry,

Yes, I believe the token will give full access to Swift and any other services the the token provides access to (potentially Glance/etc) until it expires.

Instead of reinventing the wheel with pyOpenSSL, I think it would be much better to use requests module which provide this functionality and is used by other OpenStack clients.

See [bug 1255279](/bugs/1255279) for more information.

I started a patch for switching to python-requests in order to fix this bug:

  <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/69187>

This have been discussed during the last swift meeting (see #topic swiftclient + ssl):

  <http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/meetings/swift/2014/swift.2014-01-22-19.00.log.html>

As long as python-requests does not feature ssl compression disabling, this will be vulnerable to a CRIME like attack. Though certificate verification is a real issue that should be addressed asap.

Port to python-requests

Currently, httplib implementation does not support SSL certificate

    verification. This patch fixes this. Note that ssl compression parameter

    and 100-continue thing is still missing from requests, though those are

    lower priority.

Requests now takes care of:

    \* proxy configuration (get\_environ\_proxies),

    \* chunked encoding (with data generator),

    \* bulk uploading (with files dictionary),

    \* SSL certificate verification (with 'insecure' and 'cacert' parameter).

This patch have been tested with requests 1.1.0 (CentOS 6) and requests

    2.2.1 (current version).

@prometheanfire: python-swiftclient-2.0.2 contains the fix.

The version have bumped to 2.0 because this fix will break 1.0 (if certificates weren't verified, 1.0 users would be required to add the '--insecure' parameter for swiftclient to keep working). Thus there is no plan to backport this to swiftclient 1.0 branch.

### Bug Description

Thomas Leaman (HP) reported in public [bug 1192229](/bugs/1192229) that the Swift python client does not perform any kind of SSL certificate validation, which makes it vulnerable to MiM attacks.

This bug was filed to track this specific issue.

Impact desc looks good.

Was wondering though: Once the MiM setup captures the token, couldn't it reuse it for full account access and profit ?

Yes, I believe the token will give full access to Swift and any other services the the token provides access to (potentially Glance/etc) until it expires.

Instead of reinventing the wheel with pyOpenSSL, I think it would be much better to use requests module which provide this functionality and is used by other OpenStack clients.

See [bug 1255279](/bugs/1255279) for more information.

Jakub, this suggestion has been raised and addressed before (see the comments on <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/33473/> around patchset 9).

Title: Missing SSL certificate check in Python Swift client

Reporter: Thomas Leaman (HP)

Products: python-swiftclient

Affects: All versions

Description:

Thomas Leaman from HP reported that the Python Swift client was failing to properly check certificates during the establishment of HTTPS connections. A remote attacker with access over segments of the network between client and server could potentially set up a man-in-the-middle attack and access the contents of the Swift client's communication with the server, including any used credentials.

I started a patch for switching to python-requests in order to fix this bug:

  <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/69187>

This have been discussed during the last swift meeting (see #topic swiftclient + ssl):

  <http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/meetings/swift/2014/swift.2014-01-22-19.00.log.html>

As long as python-requests does not feature ssl compression disabling, this will be vulnerable to a CRIME like attack. Though certificate verification is a real issue that should be addressed asap.

commit b182112719ab87942472e44aa3446ea0eb19a289

Port to python-requests

Currently, httplib implementation does not support SSL certificate

    verification. This patch fixes this. Note that ssl compression parameter

    and 100-continue thing is still missing from requests, though those are

    lower priority.

Requests now takes care of:

    \* proxy configuration (get\_environ\_proxies),

    \* chunked encoding (with data generator),

    \* bulk uploading (with files dictionary),

    \* SSL certificate verification (with 'insecure' and 'cacert' parameter).

This patch have been tested with requests 1.1.0 (CentOS 6) and requests

    2.2.1 (current version).

Also, are we going to have a patch backported to >swiftclient-2 ? If not then the vuln still exists for grizzly releases.

@prometheanfire: python-swiftclient-2.0.2 contains the fix.

The version have bumped to 2.0 because this fix will break 1.0 (if certificates weren't verified, 1.0 users would be required to add the '--insecure' parameter for swiftclient to keep working). Thus there is no plan to backport this to swiftclient 1.0 branch.
