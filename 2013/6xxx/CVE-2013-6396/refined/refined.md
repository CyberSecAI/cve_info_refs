Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6396

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `python-swiftclient` was not performing proper SSL certificate validation when establishing HTTPS connections. This was due to the usage of the `httplib` library which does not support SSL certificate verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing SSL certificate validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: A remote attacker positioned on the network between the client and server could intercept communications.
- Exposure of credentials and data: An attacker could access the contents of the `python-swiftclient`'s communication with the server, including authentication tokens and other sensitive information.
- Full account access:  Captured authentication tokens could be reused by the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user's Swift account and potentially other services that the token provides access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based MitM attack: An attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the Swift server. This could be achieved through various means, such as ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing, or compromising a router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker must be able to intercept traffic between the client running `python-swiftclient` and the Swift server. This implies a position within the same network segment or on a routing path between the two.
- Ability to perform MitM: The attacker needs to be able to perform an active MitM attack, intercepting and potentially modifying communications.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved switching to the `python-requests` library, which supports SSL certificate verification.
- The fix was included in `python-swiftclient` version 2.0.2 and later.
-  The vulnerability was publicly reported, which is why a CVE was requested and assigned.
- There was discussion on not backporting the fix to the 1.0 branch due to breaking compatibility (requiring users to use --insecure parameter if certs weren't verified).
