Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-6329:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the GSKit component related to SSL handshake processing within IBM HTTP Server. Specifically, a specially crafted or malformed SSL message or certificate chain can trigger the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a potential denial of service. The malformed SSL message can cause the server process to crash or hang, rendering the service unavailable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Service Disruption:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service, impacting the availability of the IBM HTTP Server and potentially any applications relying on it.
-   **Resource Exhaustion:** In some cases, the vulnerability might lead to resource exhaustion, causing increased CPU utilization.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based. The attacker sends the crafted SSL message/certificate chain to the vulnerable server.
-   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the targeted IBM HTTP Server.
-   **Crafted SSL Message:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific type of SSL message or a malformed certificate chain.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
-   IBM HTTP Server component of:
    -   WebSphere Application Server (Versions 6.1, 7, 8, 8.5, and 8.5.5)
    -   Content Manager OnDemand for Multiplatform (Versions 8.5 and 9.0)
    -   Tivoli Access Manager for e-business (All supported versions)

**Additional details:**
-   The issue is related to the SSLv3 session cache and disabling the SSLv3 session cache can circumvent the issue, but may lead to higher CPU usage.
-   For WebSphere Application Server Version 7, the fix for this issue is superseded by fix for PI09443 (CVE-2013-6747) due to a publishing problem.
-   GSKit versions 7.0.4.47 or higher and 8.0.50.13 or higher contain the fix for this vulnerability in Tivoli Access Manager.
