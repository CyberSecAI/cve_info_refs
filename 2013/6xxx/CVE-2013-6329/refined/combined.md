How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**CVE ID:** [**CVE-2014-0963**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963) **(PI17025)

DESCRIPTION:** IBM HTTP Server is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM HTTP Server and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex.

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM HTTP Server instances, or monitor the mod\_mpmstats output written to the ErrorLog.

**CVE ID:** [**CVE-2014-0963**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963) **(PI17025)

DESCRIPTION:** IBM HTTP Server is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM HTTP Server and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex.

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM HTTP Server instances, or monitor the mod\_mpmstats output written to the ErrorLog.

# Security Bulletin: Potential Denial of service vulnerability in IBM HTTP Server (CVE-2013-6329)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A potential denial of service vulnerability in SSL handshake processing in IBM HTTP Server (IHS).

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2013-6329](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6329)

## Affected Products and Versions

**VERSIONS AFFECTED:** This problem affects the IBM HTTP Server component in all editions of WebSphere Application Server and bundling products:

· Version 8.5.5

· Version 8.5

· Version 8

· Version 7

· Version 6.1

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the Fix Pack or PTF for each named product as soon as practical

***Fix:***Apply a Fix Pack or PTF containing APAR PI05309, as noted below:

**For affected IBM HTTP Server for WebSphere Application Server:**

**For V8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.1 Full Profile:**

* Apply Interim Fix [PI05309](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036723)

--OR--

* Apply Fix Pack 8.5.5.2 or later.

 **For V8.0 through 8.0.0.8:**

* Apply Interim Fix [PI05309](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036723)

--OR--

* Apply Fix Pack 8.0.0.9 or later.

**For V7.0.0.0 through 7.0.0.31:**

Due to a publishing issue with PI05309 for Version 7 only, apply PI09443 which supercedes the fix for PI05309

* Apply Interim Fix [PI09443](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036992)

--OR--

* Apply Fix Pack 7.0.0.33 or later.

 **For V6.1.0.0 through 6.1.0.47:**

* Apply Interim Fix [PI05309](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036723)

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Disabling the SSLv3 Session cache will circumvent this issue, but may lead to higher CPU usage. To use the circumvention:

**For Windows platforms, do one of the following:**

* Any Release:

+ Set the system wide environment variable *'GSK\_V3\_SIDCACHE\_SIZE=0"*
+ Restart the system

--OR--

* For IBM HTTP Server Version 8.0.0.0 or later:

+ Set the following directive everywhere you use the *'SSLEnable'* directive:

 *SSLAttributeSet 305 0 NUMERIC*

**For Other platforms, do one of the following:**

* Any Release:

+ Export the native environment variable *'GSK\_V3\_SIDCACHE\_SIZE=0'* in *'$IHSROOT/bin/envvars'*
+ Perform a full stop and start of the server.
+ Set *"SSLCacheDisable"* at the bottom of httpd.conf

--OR--

* For IHS Version 8.0.0.0 or later:

+ Set the following directive everywhere you use the *'SSLEnable'* directive:

*SSLAttributeSet 305 0 NUMERIC*
+ Set *"SSLCacheDisable"* at the bottom of httpd.conf
