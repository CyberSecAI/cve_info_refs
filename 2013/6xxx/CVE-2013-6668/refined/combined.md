On the first message, the CVEs listed at the beginning refer to the following:  CVE-2013-7370 CVE-2013-7371: <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/methodOverride_Middleware_Reflected_Cross-Site_Scripting> More info at: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q2/151>  CVE-2013-6393: <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/libyaml_heap-based_buffer_overflow_when_parsing_YAML_tags> which we've fixed in our libyaml package already  CVE-2013-4660: <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/JS-YAML_Deserialization_Code_Execution>  The second message linked at the beginning of this bug report gave CVEs to the other nodesecurity advisories.  I'm not sure which Node.js versions may be affected or may contain fixes for these, but we may want to update Node.js for stable releases some time soon.

I tried to fixed as many deps as possible, shrinking broken deps from a 1Mb html page to a 8ko one. As far as I'm concerned, the nodejs maintainer would be dams.  I think you should check the impacts using "urpmf --requires" for binary deps and "urpmf --requires --synthesis SRPMS/core/release/media_info/synt*cz" for source deps in order to identify which end packages would be affected Then you could mail this to dev ml & affected packagers, warning their packages would be at risk b/c of their nodejs deps. ```  ---   Hardware: i586 => AllAssignee: thierry.vignaud => bugsquad  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=13383#c16)  Joseph Wang    2014-12-08 01:23:04 CET  ``` I'll update everything to the latest versions. ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=13383#c17)  Joseph Wang    2014-12-08 02:16:10 CET  ``` Upgraded nodejs-js-yaml to latest version to fix CVE-2013-4660 ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=13383#c18)  Joseph Wang    2014-12-08 02:22:17 CET  ``` I've requests a freeze push for js-yaml that fixes that issue.  nodejs-connect is not in Mageia.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2014/03/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Monday, March 3, 2014

The Stable Channel has been updated to 33.0.1750.146 for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

This update includes [19 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-1-M33+label%3AM-33+-Security_Severity%3DNone+&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Iteration+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or particularly interesting. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[343964](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=343964), [344186](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=344186), [347909](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=347909)] CVE-2013-6668: Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed in version 3.24.35.10.

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer).

This release fixes a number of crashes and other bugs. A full list of changes is available in the [SVN log](http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/branches/1750/src&range=254388:252094&mode=html).

## Updated nodejs package fixes security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 09 Dec 2014

Modification date: 09 Dec 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-5256](CVE-2014-5256.html)
,
[CVE-2013-6668](CVE-2013-6668.html)

## Description

```
Updated nodejs package fixes security vulnerabilities:

A memory corruption vulnerability, which results in a denial-of-service, was
identified in the versions of V8 that ship with Node.js 0.8 and 0.10. In
certain circumstances, a particularly deep recursive workload that may trigger
a GC and receive an interrupt may overflow the stack and result in a
segmentation fault. For instance, if your work load involves successive
JSON.parse calls and the parsed objects are significantly deep, you may
experience the process aborting while parsing (CVE-2014-5256).

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Google V8 before 3.24.35.10, as used
in Node.js before 0.10.31, allow attackers to cause a denial of service or
possibly have other impact via unknown vectors (CVE-2013-6668).

The nodejs package has been updated to version 0.10.33 to fix these issues
as well as several other bugs.
