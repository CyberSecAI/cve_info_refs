Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of implementation of a mechanism to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks on input forms within the xAdmin and xDashboard applications of EMC Document Sciences xPression.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. Specifically, the applications do not implement proper CSRF protection, making them vulnerable to this type of attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could forge requests on behalf of a victim. This could lead to unauthorized actions being performed within the application, such as changes to settings, data modification, or other actions that the victim is authorized to do.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious website, email, or other means that tricks the victim's browser into making unauthorized requests to the vulnerable application while the victim is logged in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a user who is logged into the vulnerable application to load content that initiates a request to the application. The attacker doesn't require direct access to the application but needs to be able to exploit the victim's active session.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in EMC Document Sciences xPression version 4.2 Patch 16 and possibly earlier versions, specifically in the xAdmin and xDashboard applications.
*   EMC has stated the vulnerability exists in versions 4.2 before Patch 26 and version 4.5 before Patch 05 but does not exist in versions 4.1.x.
