## What Customers Say About Pydio

Transparent Background:

Pydio helped us solve many regulatory compliance issues. We needed a fast-to-deploy on-premise solution to allow auditable file exchanges with our customers and Pydio really fits the bill. Pydio's premium remote support was the cherry on the cake.

Dimitri R - Security & System administrator at major Insurance company

We've been using Pydio for years now and the platform has always met our needs for end user experience and advanced security. Today we have more than 10 Pydio instances and they are at the heart of our customer data exchanges. Moreover, GDPR has strengthened our desire to control our data and Pydio responds very well to this need.

Jeremy Godefroy - Deputy IT Manager at Inter Public Group

We’ve been using Pydio Cells at CY Cergy Paris Université as a sovereign solution for our research staff since early 2019. Following the increased need for collaboration during the Covid19 crisis, we opened the tool to all university staff. It meets our needs very well and is easy to learn. The granular access management via the 'Cells' concept is very flexible and efficient.
