```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `fStorage` member of `SkRgnBuilder` was not being initialized in all cases, leading to the destructor freeing garbage data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of uninitialized memory. Specifically, if `SkRgnBuilder::init()` fails, `fStorage` is not initialized, leading to a double-free or use-after-free vulnerability when the `SkRgnBuilder` object is destroyed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploitation would occur through any code path that creates an `SkRgnBuilder` object and results in `SkRgnBuilder::init()` failing. This would depend on the specific usage context within Skia.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to influence the conditions under which the `SkRgnBuilder` is used in such a way that the call to `SkRgnBuilder::init()` fails."
