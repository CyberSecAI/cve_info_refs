## Aker Secure Mail Gateway reflected XSS vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#687278

Original Release Date: 2014-03-06 | Last Revised: 2014-03-06

---

### Overview

Aker Secure Mail Gateway 2.5.2 and previous versions contain a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html))

### Description

| [**CWE-79**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** - CVE-2013-6037  Aker Secure Mail Gateway 2.5.2 and previous versions contain a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the index.php page. An attacker is able to load arbitrary script in the context of the user's browser through the msg\_id parameter. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**The vendor has released a [hotfix](http://download.aker.com.br/prod/current/atualizacoes/aker-secure-mail-gateway-2.5/patch-2/akersecuremailgateway-2.5-pt-box-patch-002-hotfix-023-0002.akp) to address this vulnerability. If you are unable to upgrade, please consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the Fortiweb interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
