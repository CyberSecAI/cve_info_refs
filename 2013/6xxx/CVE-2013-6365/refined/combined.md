### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

### [CVEProject/cve-schema](/CVEProject/cve-schema)[Support PURL as identifier](/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/173)

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.
