Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Quassel IRC core (server daemon) stores user-specific data like backlog in a shared database, tagging them with a user ID. However, some SQL queries did not properly check for the correct user ID when accessing this data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Data Access:** The core vulnerability lies in the SQL queries that failed to validate user IDs when retrieving buffer data. This allows an attacker to bypass access controls and retrieve information belonging to other users on the same core.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application did not sufficiently validate user inputs related to `BufferID` when querying the database, allowing for the retrieval of data associated with other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An authenticated, malicious user could potentially access the backlog of IRC channels and queries belonging to other users on the same Quassel core. This unauthorized access could expose private communications and sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Client:** The attack requires a custom-built client application that sends specifically crafted requests to the Quassel core. This client has to provide a manipulated `BufferID`.
*   **Network Access:** The malicious user must have network access to the Quassel core to interact with it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a legitimate user on the Quassel core, requiring valid user credentials. This implies that the attack occurs from the inside by a user who has some access but whose access should be limited.
*   **Technical Proficiency:**  The attacker must have the technical skills to create a custom IRC client or manipulate an existing one to send crafted requests to the Quassel core.
*   **Shared Core:** The attack is only possible if multiple users are sharing the same Quassel core.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves adding user ID checks to the relevant SQL queries.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Quassel version 0.9.2.
*   The commit on GitHub (a1a24da) shows the code changes made to correct the SQL queries. Specifically it ensures that the `userid` is checked when selecting buffer data and updating network information in both PostgreSQL and SQLite databases.
* The openSUSE security update includes dropping a specific patch as the fix was merged upstream and updating the package to 0.9.2
