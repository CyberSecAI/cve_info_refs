This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Make sure that clients can't access buffers belonging to other users

```
A manipulated, but properly authenticated client was able to retrieve
the backlog of other users on the same core in some cases by providing
an appropriate BufferID to the storage engine. Note that proper
authentication was still required, so exploiting this requires
malicious users on your core. This commit fixes this issue by ensuring
that foreign BufferIDs are off-limits.

Besides various bugfixes (among those, Phonon notifications play sound again!), and a bunch of new and improved translations, the main reason for this one is, unfortunately, another vulnerability: with a carefully manipulated client, you can retrieve the backlog of other users on the quasselcore you're using. Proper authentication is still needed, so this will only affect people who allow untrusted and malicious users on their shared core. Still, an upgrade is highly recommended.  If you happen to be a distro packager, please be advised to backport (i.e. simply apply) [this](https://github.com/quassel/quassel/commit/1fc8eb59a87c005ddfe7d21bc225bef8692b9743) and, if you haven't done so yet since the release of 0.9.1, [this](https://github.com/quassel/quassel/commit/aa1008be162cb27da938cce93ba533f54d228869) patch to your packages, if you can't bump them to 0.9.2 for release process reasons.  Well, here's hoping that next time we won't have that sense of urgency again :)  Have a nice day, and happy updating, ~ Sput  »  * [Sputnick's blog](/blog/1 "Read Sputnick's latest blog entries.") |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
