**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write within the V8 JavaScript engine.

**Vulnerability/Weakness:**
The core issue is an out-of-bounds write, which means the program is attempting to write data to a memory location outside of the allocated buffer. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution, denial of service (DoS), or other unpredictable behavior.
