Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6911:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Cybozu Garoon. The specific locations or mechanisms of these vulnerabilities are not detailed in this document, but the core issue is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The documents indicate there are *multiple* such vulnerabilities within the software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the web page
*   Redirection to malicious websites
*   Information theft
*   Malware injection

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface of Cybozu Garoon. An attacker would need to inject malicious scripts into input fields or through other means that would be rendered within a user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code that will be rendered in a user's browser.
*   The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with the malicious content, such as by clicking a link or viewing a crafted page/file. This can often be achieved through social engineering tactics.
* The vulnerability can be attacked over the internet

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Cybozu Garoon version 3.7 Service Pack 1 and earlier.
*   The JVN analysis rates the Access Required as High (can be attacked over the Internet), Authentication as High (anonymous or no authentication), User Interaction Required as Mid (user needs to be convinced to take a standard action), and Exploit Complexity as High (the user must be convinced to take a difficult or suspicious action).
*   The vendor's website provides update information to remediate the vulnerability.
