Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The D-Link DSL-6740U router is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to insufficient input sanitization in the Web-GUI configuration. The router is also susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, which allow an attacker to forge commands that execute actions in an authenticated browser session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The web interface doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The router's web interface does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to submit forged requests to the web interface that can execute administrative actions in an authenticated userâ€™s session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can change the router's configuration, including administrator credentials.
*   An attacker can enable remote management services, potentially gaining full control of the router.
*   The router can become unreliable, leading to denial of service.
*   Malicious code can be injected in the web interface that could potentially affect other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link.
*   The attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into browsing a malicious website.
*   The attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   The attacker can use forged HTTP requests to the web interface using CSRF techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user (with an active logged-in management session) into performing an action.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the local network but can perform the attacks remotely, especially if remote management is enabled on the device.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability exists in several features including: Port Forwarding Setup, Port Triggering, URL Filter, Print Server settings, QoS Queue Setup, and QoS Classification Entries.
*   The vendor considers the scope and impact of the vulnerability to be narrow due to the requirement of having an active logged-in session.
*   D-Link will release a firmware update by the end of December 2013 to address this issue.
*   The advisory recommends users to not enable the Remote Management feature as a temporary workaround.
*   The advisory recommends not to click on links received in unsolicited emails and to secure the wireless network with a strong password.
