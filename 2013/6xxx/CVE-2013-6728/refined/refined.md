- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A charting feature in WebSphere Dashboard Framework allows access and deletion of generated images in a temporary folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure file access control: The charting feature, intended to be protected by security constraints for authenticated users, can be misconfigured to allow unauthenticated access.
    - File deletion vulnerability: Both unauthenticated users (due to misconfiguration) and authenticated yet malicious users can use the feature to retrieve and delete files in the temporary folder.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can access and delete files in the temporary folder.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Unauthenticated access: Exploiting misconfigurations in security constraints that enable access without authentication.
    - Authenticated malicious user: Exploiting the charting feature with valid credentials to perform file operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - For unauthenticated access: Network access to the vulnerable system with a misconfigured security setup.
    - For authenticated malicious user: Valid credentials for the WebSphere Dashboard Framework.
