Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the Ad-minister version 0.6 WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The identified vulnerability is XSS. The specific type of XSS (stored, reflected, DOM-based) is not specified in the provided content, but it is likely a reflected XSS given it is being reported and not actively exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the affected plugin. The impact of successful exploitation would depend on the context of where the XSS vulnerability is triggered and the permissions/capabilities of the user executing the script. It could potentially lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Phishing attacks
  - Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim
- This could affect the security and integrity of the entire WordPress site running the vulnerable plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Ad-minister plugin. An attacker would need to find an input field within the plugin which does not sanitize data and allows the injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable field and have the JavaScript run in the context of a victim user.  This may require the ability to craft a specific URL or inject malicious data through other means.
- The attacker would not necessarily need to be authenticated to the WordPress site, but would need to have the user's browser access the malicious input.
