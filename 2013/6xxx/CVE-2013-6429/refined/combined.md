| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1053290#c0)  David Jorm    2014-01-14 22:48:04 UTC  ``` It was found that the Spring MVC SourceHttpMessageConverter processed user-provided XML, and did not expose any property for disabling entity resolution in the XML. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the application server. The patch for this flaw disables external entity processing by default, and provides a configuration directive to re-enable it. This flaw is considered to be the result of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2013-4152](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4152).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1053290#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-14 23:25:43 UTC  ``` The upstream git commit to correct this issue is here:  <https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/2ae6a6a3415eebc57babcb9d3e5505887eda6d8a>   External References:  <http://www.gopivotal.com/security/cve-2013-6429>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1053290#c4)  Chess Hazlett    2014-04-15 02:36:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss AM-Q 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2014:0401 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0401.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1053290#c5)  Chess Hazlett    2014-04-15 02:39:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2014:0400 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0400.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1062337#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-06 17:02:05 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Apache Commons FileUpload.  Specially-crafted input could trigger a denial of service if the buffer used by the MultipartStream was not big enough.  Tomcat 7 includes an embedded copy of Apache Commons FileUpload, so it was possible to craft a malformed Content-Type header for a multipart request which would cause Tomcat to enter an infinite loop.  This has been corrected in Tomcat 7 via commit r1565169 [1].  It has been corrected in Apache Commons FileUpload via commit r1565143 [2].  No new releases have been made with the changes; Tomcat 7.0.51 (not yet released) will correct this flaw.

# CVE-2013-6429 Fix for XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (CVE-2013-7315) in Spring Framework was Incomplete

HIGH | JANUARY 14, 2014 | CVE-2013-6429
# Description

Spring MVC's SourceHttpMessageConverter also processed user provided XML and neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable them. SourceHttpMessageConverter has been modified to provide an option to control the processing of XML external entities and that processing is now disabled by default. It was subsequently discovered that this fix was also incomplete (CVE-2014-0054).

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring MVC 3.0.0 to 3.2.4
* Spring MVC 4.0.0.M1-4.0.0.RC1
* Earlier unsupported versions may be affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:

* Users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.5 or later
* Users of 4.x should upgrade to 4.0.0 or later (This is also fixed in 4.0.0-RC2 but users are recommended to use 4.0.0 or later)
* To fully mitigate this issue (including CVE-2014-0054), users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.8 or later and users of 4.x should upgrade to 4.0.2 or later.

# Credit

This issue was identified by the Spring development team.

# References

* <https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-11078>

# History

2014-Jan-15: Initial vulnerability report.

* 2014-Jun-19: Update to reflect split of CVE-2013-4152 into CVE-2013-4152 and CVE-2013-7315. Added information on additional vulnerability report that identified that this fix was incomplete.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1075328#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-12 04:16:26 UTC  ``` The fixes for the [CVE-2013-7315](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7315) ([bug 1061509](show_bug.cgi?id=1061509 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-7315 Spring Framework: XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw")) and [CVE-2013-6429](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-6429) ([bug 1053290](show_bug.cgi?id=1053290 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-6429 Spring Framework: XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw")) XML External Entity (XXE) issues were found to be incomplete. From the original advisory:  "Spring MVC's Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter also processed user provided XML and neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable them. Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter has been modified to provide an option to control the processing of XML external entities and that processing is now disabled by default."  This issue affects versions 3.0.0 to 3.2.8, and versions 4.0.0 to 4.0.1.  External References:  <http://www.gopivotal.com/security/cve-2014-0054>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1075328#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2014-03-20 20:17:24 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. OpenShift Enterprise 1 is currently in the Production 1 phase of its lifecycle, as such this issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Satellite Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/site/support/policy/updates/openshift> page.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1075328#c4)  Chess Hazlett    2014-04-15 02:37:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss AM-Q 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2014:0401 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0401.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1075328#c5)  Chess Hazlett    2014-04-15 02:40:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2014:0400 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0400.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1075328#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2014-09-05 19:55:29 UTC  ``` This issue is being deferred for OpenShift Enterprise 2, only authenticated users have access to ActiveMQ (and thus the ability to exploit this Spring issue). A later update may address this issue.   ``` |  |

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

Security fixes:

A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
XML signature via a specially crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

A flaw was found in the Apache Hadoop RPC protocol. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could possibly use this flaw to unilaterally disable bidirectional
authentication between a client and a server, forcing a downgrade to simple
(unidirectional) authentication. This flaw only affected users who have
enabled Hadoop's Kerberos security features. (CVE-2013-2192)

It was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property
for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
application server. (CVE-2013-4152)

It was discovered that the Apache Santuario XML Security for Java project
allowed Document Type Definitions (DTDs) to be processed when applying
Transforms even when secure validation was enabled. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system, causing a
denial of service. (CVE-2013-4517)

It was found that the Spring MVC SourceHttpMessageConverter enabled entity
resolution by default. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct XXE
attacks on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
application server. (CVE-2013-6429)

The Spring JavaScript escape method insufficiently escaped some characters.
Applications using this method to escape user-supplied content, which would
be rendered in HTML5 documents, could be exposed to cross-site scripting
(XSS) flaws. (CVE-2013-6430)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload
handled small-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a
multipart request, causing Apache Commons FileUpload to enter an infinite
loop when processing such an incoming request. (CVE-2014-0050)

It was found that fixes for the CVE-2013-4152 and CVE-2013-6429 XXE issues
in Spring were incomplete. Spring MVC processed user-provided XML and
neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable
them, possibly allowing a remote attacker to conduct XXE attacks.
(CVE-2014-0054)

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Spring Framework when
using Spring MVC. When the action was not specified in a Spring form, the
action field would be populated with the requested URI, allowing an
attacker to inject malicious content into the form. (CVE-2014-1904)

The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
in /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom
library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native
libraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI
writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way Apache Zookeeper stored
the password of an administrative user in the log files. A local user with
access to these log files could use the exposed sensitive information to
gain administrative access to an application using Apache Zookeeper.
(CVE-2014-0085)

The CVE-2013-6430 issue was discovered by Jon Passki of Coverity SRL and
Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team, the CVE-2013-2035
issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security
Team, and the CVE-2014-0085 issue was discovered by Graeme Colman of
Red Hat.
