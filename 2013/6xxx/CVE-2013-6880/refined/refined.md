Title: CVE-2013-6880 FlashCanvas proxy.php XSS Vulnerability
Date Published: 11 December 2013
Reference: CVE-2013-6880
Vendor: FlashCanvas.net
Affected Software: FlashCanvas 1.5 and possibly older. Also used in other software frameworks such as WebShims.

Description of Issue:
The proxy.php script does not adequately verify the *Referer* header before requesting (via curl) the remote URL specified in the ‘url’ GET parameter and rendering it.

Root cause of vulnerability:
Insufficient validation of the Referer header in the proxy.php script.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
Cross-site scripting (XSS).

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can inject malicious code into the context of the target site by exploiting the vulnerable proxy.php script.
This can lead to various attacks like stealing session cookies, arbitrary script execution and DOM manipulation within the target domain.

Attack vectors:
The attacker needs to control a website that can serve a page ending in /flashcanvas.swf. They then craft a malicious link that, when clicked by a user logged into the target site, makes a request to the vulnerable proxy.php with a passable Referer header. The proxy.php then fetches and renders a specified malicious URL in the target site's context.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs control of an external website to host a malicious /flashcanvas.swf file and must entice a logged-in user of the target website to click a crafted link.
