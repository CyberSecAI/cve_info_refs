# Fwd: [vs] multiple issues in openjpeg

Hi,

This was unembargoed yesterday, so here's a copy of the messages sent
to the distros list.
There were no responses, so no messages are missing.

In the meantime I've received a response from one of upstream authors,
Mathieu Malaterre, saying he would be reviewing the patches at a later
time.

This work was done as part of a review of openjpeg for EDF.

Cheers,
Raphael

Hi again,

Given that there has been no response whatsoever...

Subject: [vs] multiple issues in openjpeg
To: distros () vs openwall org

Hi everyone,

During a review for EDF, I discovered multiple kinds of
vulnerabilities in openjpeg (different than CVE-2013-4289 and
CVE-2013-4290).

Summary:
* multiple denial of service (null ptr deref, high resource
consumption - in the order of 20GBs, division by zero, etc),
* invalid free()s (didn't check impact),
* out of bounds array reads and writes (similar to CVE-2012-3358, so
possibly exploitable to run arbitrary code),
* a format string bug (didn't check impact, at least DoS, ileak), and
* the use of uninitialized memory for all sorts of things.

Notice that this does not constitute a full review and that there
surely are more issues left in the code base.

Versions reviewed:
* 1.3 (with Debian's patches, as found in Debian squeeze and wheezy), and
* 1.5.1 (as found in Debian experimental).
Other versions might also be affected.

Upstream was contacted but got no response.

CVE-wise, I've classified the issues as following:

1. heap OOB reads, information leaks
2. ditto, but only affecting 1.5.1
3. heap OOB writes (CVE-2013-6045)
4. ditto but only affecting 1.3
5. null pointer dereferences, division by zero, and anything that
would just fit as DoS (CVE-2013-1447)
6. ditto, but only affecting 1.5.1

The two CVE ids above come from Debian's pool, but given the above
classification more ids are going to be needed. If there's an
agreement to the above, could somebody please assign some other ids?

Now, as for the vulnerabilities themselves, they are best described by
the attached patches. If details for any specific patch are desired
don't hesitate to ask. They should apply to both versions almost
as-is, if they don't, prod me.

Patches by categories defined above:

1.
shifting_too_much.patch
2.
segfault3.patch
3.
segfault0.patch
segfault1.patch
segfault2.patch
segfault5.patch
segfault7.patch
4.
qcx_backport.patch
5.
bloop1.patch
bloop2.patch
divbyzero.patch
null-ptr-deref.patch
segfault4.patch
segfault6.patch
segfault8.patch
segfault10.patch
uint_overflow.patch
6.
ifree1.patch

The patch that replaces malloc with calloc (segfault4.patch) is surely
enough just a workaround, but there are too many problems with the
code to spend further time on it.

Desired CDR: 3rd of December, 07:00 UTC

Cheers,

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1036493#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-02 06:57:18 UTC  ``` Raphael Geissert discovered out-of-bounds memory read flaws in OpenJPEG. If a specially-crafted image were opened by an application linked against OpenJPEG, it could cause the application to crash or lead to information leaks.  These issues only affected the version of OpenJPEG as shipped in Fedora (version 1.5.1)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1036493#c1)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-02 07:31:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 831460](attachment.cgi?id=831460&action=diff "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=831460&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1036493#c2)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-02 14:04:38 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Raphael Geissert for reporting these issues during a review for EDF.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1036493#c3)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-05 05:05:40 UTC  ```  Created openjpeg tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1038409](show_bug.cgi?id=1038409 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-6887 CVE-2013-1447 CVE-2013-6045 CVE-2013-6052 CVE-2013-6053 openjpeg: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1036493#c4)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-05 05:05:48 UTC  ```  Created mingw-openjpeg tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1038410](show_bug.cgi?id=1038410 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-6045 CVE-2013-6052 CVE-2013-6053 mingw-openjpeg: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1036493#c6)  Huzaifa S.
