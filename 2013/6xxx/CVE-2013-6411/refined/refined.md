Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6411:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of aircraft crashes when they occur near the map's border. Specifically, when an aircraft runs out of fuel and crashes outside the map boundary, the game attempts to access tile data outside of the allocated map array, leading to a crash or assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read in the `GetSlopePixelZ` function when an aircraft crashes outside the map's boundaries. The game logic does not properly handle the edge case of an aircraft crashing outside the map, resulting in invalid memory access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a server crash, making the server unavailable for legitimate players. This is applicable in multiplayer scenarios, affecting all connected players. The server crash is due to invalid memory access, which may manifest as a segmentation fault on stable releases or trigger an assertion in other builds.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating game mechanics to create a specific scenario.
  1. Create an airport at the map corner, connecting it with a rail station.
  2. Have aircrafts start from another location or the same airport and have them circle the corner airport.
  3. Remove the airport, leaving only the rail station, and then remove that rail station as well.
  4. The aircrafts will continue to circle and crash due to lack of fuel, triggering the out-of-bounds read if near the map edge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the game world by creating and removing game elements, such as airports and rail stations, to force aircraft to crash near the edge of the map. This can be done by any player in a multiplayer game or in a single-player game.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present from version 0.3.6 up to 1.3.2 of OpenTTD and was fixed in version 1.3.3.
- The fix involves clamping the x and y coordinates of the aircraft to the bounds of the map before calling `GetSlopePixelZ`. This prevents the out-of-bounds memory access and subsequent crash.
- The issue was initially reported as FlySpray issue #5820 and later tracked as GitHub issue #5820.
- Patches were made available for versions 0.3.6 - 0.5.3, 0.6.0 - 0.7.3, 1.0.0 - 1.1.5 and 1.2.0 - 1.3.2
- The vulnerability is reproducible in both singleplayer and multiplayer modes.
