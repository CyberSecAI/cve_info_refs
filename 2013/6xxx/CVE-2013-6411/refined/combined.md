***The\_Dude* opened the ticket and wrote:**

> There is a bug which causes crash when an airplane crashes.
>
> It is harder to make it, but it can crash some games, in multiplayer too.
>
> Technique:
>
> build airport at the map corner and join it with rail station (from some reason it doesnt happen with other station, at least from my few tries).
>
> Make this airport as order for planes which will start from another plane, or with new close airport features, they may also start from the same airport.
>
> Wait until all planes are sky high and rotating around the corner airport. Now remove the airport part and leave only the rail station, then remove that one too.
>
> Planes will fly for a while, until they cant find an airport of course and they will run out of fuel. Because they were circling near the edge of map (this condition is essential), the game will crash. Happens in 1.3 and trunk. Seems the plane or its shadow is not on valid tile and some check is missing there.
>
> In included zip are two savegames, crashlog (not much there, but I remember the problem was maybe with GetSlopePixelZ) and some screenshot.

### CVE-2013-6411 (vulnerable 0.3.6 - fixed 1.3.3)

Short description: Denial of service (server) using forcefully crashed aircrafts.

Denial of service using aircrafts that are forcefully crashed.

Simple steps to reproduce the issue, and show the severity:

1. Start a new game. For this reproduction you do not need to start a server;
   you can see the crash locally, but due to the nature of OpenTTD the crash
   will also happen on the server you’re playing on in multiplayer
2. Build an airport at the map corner and join it with rail station
3. Make this airport the order destination for planes which will start
   from another place, or use the close airport feature, and then they may
   also start from the same airport
4. Wait until all planes are sky high and rotating around the corner airport
5. In case aircraft are launched from another airport, remove that airport
6. Remove the airport part of the corner airport, and leave only the rail station
7. Remove the rail station part
8. Wait for the aircraft to keep circling and eventually crash due to lack of fuel
9. Server segfaults due to invalid memory access (stable releases), or triggering
   of an assertion (most other builds)

The problem is caused by incorrectly handling the fact that the aircraft circling the
corner airport will be outside of the bounds of the map. In the ‘out of fuel’ crash
code the height of the tile under the aircraft is determined. In this case that means
a tile outside of the allocated map array, which could occasionally trigger invalid
reads.

The fix makes sure the height of the map border is used when the aircraft is outside
of the map.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

***The\_Dude* opened the ticket and wrote:**

> There is a bug which causes crash when an airplane crashes.
>
> It is harder to make it, but it can crash some games, in multiplayer too.
>
> Technique:
>
> build airport at the map corner and join it with rail station (from some reason it doesnt happen with other station, at least from my few tries).
>
> Make this airport as order for planes which will start from another plane, or with new close airport features, they may also start from the same airport.
>
> Wait until all planes are sky high and rotating around the corner airport. Now remove the airport part and leave only the rail station, then remove that one too.
>
> Planes will fly for a while, until they cant find an airport of course and they will run out of fuel. Because they were circling near the edge of map (this condition is essential), the game will crash. Happens in 1.3 and trunk. Seems the plane or its shadow is not on valid tile and some check is missing there.

> In included zip are two savegames, crashlog (not much there, but I remember the problem was maybe with GetSlopePixelZ) and some screenshot.
