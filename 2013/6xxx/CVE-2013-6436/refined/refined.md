Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6436:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of memory tunables when reading from LXC (Linux Containers) guests within the libvirt virtualization toolkit. Specifically, the libvirt daemon (libvirtd) did not properly process certain memory-related configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The core issue appears to be inadequate validation or handling of memory tunables read from LXC guests. This allowed a crafted or unexpected value to cause a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A local user could exploit this flaw to cause libvirtd to crash, leading to a denial of service on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have a user account on the affected system.
- Malicious LXC guest configuration: The attacker would need control over the configuration of an LXC guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user account on the target system.
- Ability to configure or control LXC guest settings (specifically memory tunables) that could be read by libvirtd.
