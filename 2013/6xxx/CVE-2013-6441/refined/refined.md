Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6441:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure default configuration in the LXC (Linux Containers) `sshd` template. Specifically, the template was mounting the template script itself (`lxc-sshd`) as `/sbin/init` inside the container using a writable bind mount.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Writable Bind Mount:** The core issue is that the `lxc-sshd` script was bind-mounted into the container's filesystem in a way that allowed the container to modify it. This is problematic because the mounted script resided on the host system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker gaining control of a container created using the vulnerable `sshd` template could modify the `/sbin/init` script.
*   **Host Compromise:** Because the `/sbin/init` script is bind-mounted from the host, modifying it could lead to running malicious code on the host when a new container is created using the same `sshd` template. This would mean that the next `lxc-create -t sshd` command would execute malicious code as root on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Compromise a Container:** An attacker would first need to compromise a container created with the vulnerable `sshd` template, giving them write access to the mounted `/sbin/init` script.
2.  **Modify the init script**: Once inside the container, the attacker can modify `/sbin/init` which is a mount of the lxc template on the host.
3.  **Create a new container**: The attacker then has to wait for another container to be created using `lxc-create -t sshd` for the exploit to trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial Access:** The attacker must have the ability to compromise a container created using the vulnerable LXC sshd template.
*   **Container Access**: The attacker needs to be able to execute commands inside the container to modify the mounted init script.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects the `lxc-sshd` template and any containers created using it.
*   The fix involves changing the mount option for `/sbin/init` to a read-only bind mount (`ro,bind`), preventing modifications from within the container.
*   Existing containers created with the vulnerable template need to be recreated after applying the fix.
*   The vulnerability was present in Ubuntu 13.10 and was fixed in the `lxc` package version `1.0.0~alpha1-0ubuntu14.1`
