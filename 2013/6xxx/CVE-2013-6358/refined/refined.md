{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation in the file upload process within the AdminModules controller. Specifically, the `extractArchive` function does not adequately verify if the uploaded archive contains a valid module structure or just arbitrary files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
       "Insufficient validation of uploaded content",
      "Inadequate checks for module structure"
    ],
    "impact": "A low-privileged user, such as a logistician or salesman, can upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts, to the `/modules/` directory. This can lead to:  - Disclosure of sensitive information, such as database credentials, by including a configuration file. - Full compromise of the Prestashop installation by uploading webshells, or creating superadmin user. - Potential server compromise, depending on server vulnerabilities.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with low-level employee access (e.g., logistician or salesman) to the Prestashop admin panel can upload a specially crafted archive file (ZIP or TAR) containing malicious PHP code via the module upload functionality in `AdminModules` controller.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a low-level employee account within Prestashop that has permission to upload modules.  This usually includes the Logistician and Salesman default profiles."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The blog post provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, including code snippets illustrating the flawed logic and a proof-of-concept exploit. It also indicates that Prestashop addressed the vulnerability by removing module upload permissions from default low-privilege user profiles (linked to CVE-2013-6295). The author also suggests additional mitigation strategies such as more robust validation of uploaded files."
