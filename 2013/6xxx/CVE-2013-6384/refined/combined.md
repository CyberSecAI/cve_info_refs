Subject: [OSSA 2013-031] Ceilometer DB2/MongoDB backend password leak (CVE-2013-6384)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-031
CVE: CVE-2013-6384
Date: November 25, 2013
Title: Ceilometer DB2/MongoDB backend password leak
Reporter: Eric Brown (IBM)
Products: Ceilometer
Affects: All supported versions

Description:
Eric Brown from IBM reported an information leak in Ceilometer logs. The
password for the DB2 or MongoDB backends was logged at INFO level in the
ceilometer-api logs. An attacker with access to the logs (local shell,
log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may leverage this
vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access to the
Ceilometer backend. Only Ceilometer setups using the DB2 or MongoDB
backends are affected.

### Bug Description

Both impl\_db2.py and impl\_mongodb.py log the password used to access the database by printing out the connection string from ceilometer.conf. The database connection configuration parameter is usually marked secret because it contains this password.

<https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer/blob/master/ceilometer/storage/impl_db2.py#L156>

<https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer/blob/master/ceilometer/storage/impl_mongodb.py#L158>

Typically, this ends up getting written to /var/log/ceilometer/api.log. This file is world read, thereby giving any user on the system access to the ceilometer user and password used to connect with the database and potentially more.

For example:

2013-10-22 15:33:41.244 10537 INFO ceilometer.storage.impl\_db2 [-] connecting to MongoDB on mongodb://ceilometer:fe85b844214814b95a0b@127.0.0.1:27017/ceilometer

where "ceilometer" is the user and "fe85b844214814b95a0b" is the password.

I recommend removing this line or at least masking out the password part.

LOG.info('connecting to MongoDB on %s', url)

Yes, I agree this meets the criteria for an advisory. We should issue an OSSA given that Ceilometer is no longer in incubation.

This impact description looks accurate to me.

In this case "all supported versions" only means Havana because Ceilometer did not graduate from incubation prior to the Grizzly release?

mongodb, db2: do not print full URL in logs

The full URL used to connect to MongoDB or DB2 might contains sensitive

    information such as username and password, so it's better to not print

    it at all.

    Instead, just print the hosts that are being connected to.

### Bug Description

Both impl\_db2.py and impl\_mongodb.py log the password used to access the database by printing out the connection string from ceilometer.conf. The database connection configuration parameter is usually marked secret because it contains this password.

<https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer/blob/master/ceilometer/storage/impl_db2.py#L156>

<https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer/blob/master/ceilometer/storage/impl_mongodb.py#L158>

Typically, this ends up getting written to /var/log/ceilometer/api.log. This file is world read, thereby giving any user on the system access to the ceilometer user and password used to connect with the database and potentially more.

For example:

2013-10-22 15:33:41.244 10537 INFO ceilometer.storage.impl\_db2 [-] connecting to MongoDB on mongodb://ceilometer:fe85b844214814b95a0b@127.0.0.1:27017/ceilometer

where "ceilometer" is the user and "fe85b844214814b95a0b" is the password.

I recommend removing this line or at least masking out the password part.

LOG.info('connecting to MongoDB on %s', url)

Yes, I agree this meets the criteria for an advisory. We should issue an OSSA given that Ceilometer is no longer in incubation.

Proposed impact description, please check that it's accurately describing the issue:

---------------------

Title: Ceilometer DB2/MongoDB backend password leak

Reporter: Eric Brown (IBM)

Products: Ceilometer

Affects: All supported versions

Description:

Eric Brown from IBM reported an information leak in Ceilometer logs. The password for the DB2 or MongoDB backends was logged at INFO level in the ceilometer-api logs. An attacker with access to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access to the Ceilometer backend. Only Ceilometer setups using the DB2 or MongoDB backends are affected.

This impact description looks accurate to me.

In this case "all supported versions" only means Havana because Ceilometer did not graduate from incubation prior to the Grizzly release?
