{
  "Root cause": "The Ceilometer service was logging database connection strings, including the database password, at INFO level in the ceilometer-api logs.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Information Leak",
    "Plaintext storage of secrets"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker gaining access to the Ceilometer logs (through local shell access, log aggregation systems, or accidental leaks) could obtain the database password. This could lead to privilege escalation and full access to the Ceilometer backend.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Access to Ceilometer logs"
  ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
    "Local shell access to the server running Ceilometer",
    "Access to log aggregation systems where Ceilometer logs are forwarded",
    "Exploitation of accidental leaks of the Ceilometer logs."
  ]
