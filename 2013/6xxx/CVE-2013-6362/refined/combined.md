#### Abstract

As embedded systems are more than ever present in our society, their security is becoming an increasingly important issue. However, based on the results of many recent analyses of individual firmware images, embedded systems acquired a reputation of being insecure. Despite these facts, we still lack a global understanding of embedded systemsâ security as well as the tools and techniques needed to support such general claims.

In this paper we present the first public, large-scale analysis of firmware images. In particular, we unpacked 32 thousand firmware images into 1.7 million individual files, which we then statically analyzed. We leverage this large-scale analysis to bring new insights on the security of embedded devices and to underline and detail several important challenges that need to be addressed in future research. We also show the main benefits of looking at many different devices at the same time and of linking our results with other large-scale datasets such as the ZMapâs HTTPS survey.

In summary, without performing sophisticated static analysis, we discovered a total of 38 previously unknown vulnerabilities in over 693 firmware images. Moreover, by correlating similar files inside apparently unrelated firmware images, we were able to extend some of those vulnerabilities to over 123 different products. We also confirmed that some of these vulnerabilities altogether are affecting at least 140K devices accessible over the Internet. It would not have been possible to achieve these results without an analysis at such wide scale.

We believe that this project, which we plan to provide as a firmware unpacking and analysis web service, will help shed some light on the security of embedded devices.

    Vulnerability discovered using "FIRMWARE.RE" platform/service

Security advisory numbering:
    ACSA-2013-005
    XRX13_008
    SA55306
    CVE-2013-6362

Vendor:
    Xerox
    http://www.xerox.com/

Product(s):
    Xerox ColorCube 9201/9202/9203
    Xerox WorkCenter 6400/7525/7530/7535/7545/7556/7755/7765/7775
    Please see XRX13_008

Product version(s) affected:
    Please see XRX13_008

CWE categories:
    CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
    CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password

Vulnerability details:
    The affected products/firmware versions contain an "internal FTP account" whose username is "intFTP".

    It appears to apply at least to ColorQube 92xx series.

    One particular firmware file example is "Xerox_ColorQube_upgrade_file_30823.zip/ColorQube_9201-9203_system-sw#06005000930823#.DLM".

    It is intended to upgrade "ColorQube from versions 060.050.009.03614,,060.050.009.13415 or 060.050.009.24419 to version 060.050.009.30823"

    The corresponding "/etc/passwd" entry of "intFTP" account is as folows:
        intFTP:x:51:51:Internal FTP (cc<->nc):/:/bin/bash
    The corresponding "/etc/shadow" entry of "intFTP" account is as folows:
        intFTP:$1$BbR.S$t22VMWcrVUOoTPoZwMlza.:13976::::::

    The account is active (it's shell is "/bin/bash" and not "/bin/false" nor "/bin/login")

    The account password hash "$1$BbR.S$t22VMWcrVUOoTPoZwMlza." could not be cracked via bruteforce or known-dictionaries using tools such as "John the Ripper".
    This shows that the password used is not necessarily a weak one. A security-check verifying password strength would pass this test.

    However, FIRMWARE.RE automated platform could find the corresponding password hardcoded in the firmware as "t2ZG95En"

    FIRMWARE.RE platform traced back the password "t2ZG95En" appearing in the files "/upgrade/upgrade_funcs" and "/upgrade/ftpHelper.sh"

    As far as post-discovery manual analysis was done, the files "/upgrade/upgrade_funcs" and "/upgrade/ftpHelper.sh" are used to transfer upgrade/boot images
    between CC (copy-controller?) and NC (network-controller?) components/domains of the affected devices.

    FIRMWARE.RE platform suggests, inline with NIST and CWE-798 and CWE-259, not to hardcode any credentials within the devices/firmware, as well as allowing
    easy change/update of such credentials in case it is really necessary by design to store them in the device/firmware.
