{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2013-6412",
    "description": "The transform_save function in transform.c in Augeas 1.0.0 through 1.1.0 does not properly calculate the permission values when the umask contains a \"7,\" which causes world-writable permissions to be used for new files and allows local users to modify the files via unspecified vectors.",
    "root_cause": "The `transform_save` function in Augeas incorrectly calculates file permissions when the umask contains a '7'. Instead of using a bitwise AND with the inverse of the umask, it performs a subtraction, leading to overly permissive file modes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect permission calculation",
      "Inadequate handling of umask values"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user could potentially modify configuration files created by an application using Augeas because the created files have world-writable permissions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system",
      "Manipulation of umask settings"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to modify the umask. Specifically, umask values containing '7' trigger the vulnerability"
  }
