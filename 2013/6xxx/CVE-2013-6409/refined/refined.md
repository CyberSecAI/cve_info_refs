Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6409:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises in the `adequate` tool when it's run by the root user with the `--user` option. This mode allows a local user to manipulate the tty (teletypewriter) using the `TIOCSTI` ioctl.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **TTY Hijacking:** The core weakness is the ability for a user to inject characters into the input buffer of a tty via the `TIOCSTI` ioctl. This can lead to command injection into processes running on the tty.
- **Insecure User Switching:** When `adequate` runs with `--user`, it appears to not properly drop privileges when running certain commands, making the process vulnerable to tty hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  A local user can gain elevated privileges. By injecting commands via the tty, the user can cause `adequate` (running with root privileges) to execute arbitrary commands as root.
- **TTY Control:** The attacker gains the ability to control the terminal session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have a local user account on the system.
- **Command Injection:** By using the `TIOCSTI` ioctl, the user can inject shell commands which are then executed by a process running with root privileges (in this case, a part of the `adequate` process) .

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the system where `adequate` is installed and run by root with the `--user` option.
- **Knowledge of TIOCSTI:** The attacker needs the knowledge of how to use the `TIOCSTI` ioctl to inject commands into the tty input buffer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as similar to CVE-2005-4890, which involves tty hijacking in `shadow` and `sudo` using `TIOCSTI`.
- The fix implemented in `adequate` version 0.8.1 involves switching users only when running `ldd`, redirecting `ldd`'s stdin to `/dev/null`, and not using a controlling terminal when running with reduced privileges. This mitigates the ability to inject commands via a tty.
