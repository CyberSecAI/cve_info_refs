Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6476:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `OPVPWrapper::loadDriver()` function in the `pdftoopvp` filter within `cups-filters` did not properly restrict the directories from which drivers could be loaded. This means the filter could load drivers from attacker-controlled directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Driver Loading:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper directory restrictions when loading printer drivers.
*   **Configuration via PPD:** The driver name to be loaded can be configured via a PPD file, providing a mechanism for an attacker to specify a malicious driver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By supplying a crafted PPD and placing a malicious driver in a location where the vulnerable system would access it, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the "lp" user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF/PPD:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious PDF document and its associated PPD file. These would trigger the vulnerable code path within `pdftoopvp`.
*   **Attacker Controlled Directory:** A malicious driver file needs to be placed in a directory that the system will access. This could be a location where the PDF document is processed, or a directory configured in the PPD.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PDF document, a corresponding PPD file, and a malicious driver file to the vulnerable system.
*  **File System Access:** The attacker needs some ability to cause the vulnerable system to process the crafted PDF/PPD and have the system load the malicious driver file from an attacker-controlled location.
* **User Interaction:** An unsuspecting user needs to process the malicious PDF file using CUPS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.
*   The issue was fixed in upstream `cups-filters` version 1.0.47.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple distributions, including Ubuntu and Debian.
*   The `lp` user is typically a low-privileged user on the system, but code execution with lp rights can potentially lead to further escalation.
*   The vulnerability lies in the `pdftoopvp` filter which is used to convert PDF files to a format suitable for printing.
