Package        : cups-filters
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6474 CVE-2013-6475 CVE-2013-6476

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in the pdftoopvp CUPS filter, which could result in the
execution of aribitrary code if a malformed PDF file is processed.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.18-2.1+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.47-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups-filters packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1027551#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-11-07 04:29:56 UTC  ``` It was found that the OPVPWrapper::loadDriver() function in the pdftoopvp filter did not restrict the directory drivers could be loaded from. As the driver name can be configured based on a PPD file, processing a PDF in an attacker-controlled directory containing a malicious driver could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the "lp" user.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1027551#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-03-11 05:16:11 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7176>  This issue has been resolved in upstream cups-filters-1.0.47   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1027551#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-03-11 05:19:17 UTC  ```  Created cups-filters tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1074840](show_bug.cgi?id=1074840 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-6473 CVE-2013-6476 CVE-2013-6474 CVE-2013-6475 cups-filters: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
