Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6447

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the JBoss Seam Remoting framework's `ExecutionHandler`, `PollHandler`, and `SubscriptionHandler` classes. These classes improperly handle user-supplied XML data, specifically by resolving external entities within the XML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection flaw. The Seam Remoting handlers process XML without proper sanitization or disabling of external entity resolution. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML containing external entity references.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Disclosure:** By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, a remote attacker could potentially read files accessible to the user running the application server.
- **Potential for other advanced attacks**: Although not explicitly detailed, the description alludes to the possibility of more advanced XXE attacks beyond simple file disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack is performed remotely, via HTTP requests containing crafted XML payloads.
- **XML Data:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious XML within the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of JBoss Seam Remoting:** The attacker needs to understand how JBoss Seam Remoting handles XML requests to craft a specific malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub commit shows the fix for the vulnerability, where the `SAXReader` used to parse XML is replaced with a `getSafeSaxReader` method that disables the `http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl` feature to prevent external entity resolution.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability and provides a link to the Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2014:0045) that addresses the issue.
- The vulnerability affects Seam 2.x, while Seam 3 is not affected and not planned to be fixed.
