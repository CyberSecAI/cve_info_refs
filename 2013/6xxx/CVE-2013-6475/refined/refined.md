Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-6475:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `pdftoopvp` filter within CUPS (Common Unix Printing System). This filter used `gmalloc` for memory allocation, which is prone to integer overflow issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Due to the use of `gmalloc`, integer overflows could occur when allocating memory for processing PDF files. This could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the "lp" user. The "lp" user is associated with printing tasks, and gaining control of this user could allow an attacker to compromise the system or execute malicious commands.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious PDF file. When this file is processed by the vulnerable `pdftoopvp` filter, it triggers the memory allocation errors and potential overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to submit a malicious PDF file to a system running the vulnerable CUPS version with the vulnerable `pdftoopvp` filter. This could involve sending the file as part of a print job, or having the system process the file in some other way where the vulnerable filter is invoked.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.
*   The fix involves using `gmallocn` and `gmallocn3`, which include checks for integer overflows when allocating memory.
*   The vulnerability is present in older versions of CUPS and `cups-filters`.
*   The fix was included in cups-filters version 1.0.47.
*   Several sources (Debian, Ubuntu) confirm that this vulnerability was addressed in their respective security updates.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `pdftoopvp` filter and is related to incorrect handling of memory allocations in the pdftoopvp CUPS filter.
