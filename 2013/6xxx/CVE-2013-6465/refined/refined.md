Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6465:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the jBPM KIE Workbench. Specifically, the "task name" field was vulnerable to stored XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning that malicious scripts injected by an attacker were saved in the system's database and executed when other users viewed the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users who access the jBPM workbench. This could lead to various impacts:
  - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to other user accounts.
  - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data within the application.
  - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the workbench.
  - **Malware Distribution:** Potentially redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authenticated Remote Attack:** The attack requires an authenticated user to inject malicious script code into a vulnerable field. The injected code is then executed in the browsers of other users when they view content containing the malicious code.
- **Vulnerable Field:** The specific field mentioned is the "task name" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an authenticated account in the jBPM KIE Workbench.
- The attacker must be able to create or edit content where the vulnerable field can be manipulated (e.g., create tasks with a malicious task name).

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit ([https://github.com/droolsjbpm/jbpm-console-ng/commit/4818204506e8e94645b52adb9426bedfa9ffdd04](https://github.com/droolsjbpm/jbpm-console-ng/commit/4818204506e8e94645b52adb9426bedfa9ffdd04)) shows the fix for this vulnerability. It involves using `SafeHtmlUtils.htmlEscape()` to properly encode the task name before displaying it in the UI. This prevents the browser from interpreting the potentially malicious content as HTML code, mitigating the XSS attack.
- Red Hat confirmed that this issue does not affect jBPM KIE Workbench as shipped with Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.0. It may affect earlier versions of the upstream jBPM Console NG project.
