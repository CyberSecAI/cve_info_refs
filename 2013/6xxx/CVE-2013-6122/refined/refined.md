Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper synchronization when accessing a global variable within the Goodix gt915 touchscreen driver's procfs write handler. User-supplied data is copied to this global variable and subsequently used without any mutual exclusion mechanisms, leading to race conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization):** The core issue is the absence of proper locking or synchronization primitives to protect the shared global variable from concurrent access by multiple processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Input Validation:** Attackers can exploit the race condition to manipulate the global variable, potentially bypassing input validation checks intended to prevent other vulnerabilities (like CVE-2013-4740).
- **Altering Internal State:** By racing with other processes, an attacker can modify the internal state of the handler, leading to unpredictable behavior.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** The race condition can lead to unexpected states that could crash the driver or render the touchscreen unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally by applications with write access to the driver's procfs entry.
- **Concurrent Write Operations:** Exploitation involves multiple processes concurrently writing to the procfs entry, creating a race condition that manipulates the shared global variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to write to the procfs entry of the Goodix gt915 touchscreen driver.
- They need to have a way to execute multiple processes concurrently to trigger the race condition.
