## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2014/01/stable-channel-update_27.html "Stable Channel Update")

Monday, January 27, 2014

Chrome has been updated to 32.0.1700.102 for Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome Frame.

**This update has fixes for the following issues:**

* Mouse Pointer disappears after exiting full-screen mode. ([317496](http://crbug.com/317496))
* Drag and drop files into Chrome may not work properly. ([332579](http://crbug.com/332579))
* Quicktime Plugin crashes in Chrome. ([308466](http://crbug.com/308466))
* Chrome becomes unresponsive. ([335248](http://crbug.com/335248))
* Trackpad users may not be able to scroll horizontally. ([332797](http://crbug.com/332797))
* Scrolling does not work in combo box. ([334454](http://crbug.com/334454))
* Chrome does not work with all CSS minifiers such as whitespace around a media query's `and` keyword. ([333035](http://crbug.com/333035))

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

This update includes 14 security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or particularly interesting. Please see the Chromium security page for more information.

[$1000][[330420](http://crbug.com/330420)] High CVE-2013-6649: Use-after-free in SVG images. *Credit to Atte Kettunen of OUSPG*.

[$3000][[331444](http://crbug.com/331444)] High CVE-2013-6650: Memory corruption in V8. This issue was fixed in v8 version 3.22.24.16. *Credit to Christian Holler*.

We would also like to thank *cloudfuzzer* and *miaubiz* for working with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. $6000 in additional rewards were issued.

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer).

A partial list of changes is available in the [SVN log](http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/branches/1700/src&range=246481:243157&mode=html).
