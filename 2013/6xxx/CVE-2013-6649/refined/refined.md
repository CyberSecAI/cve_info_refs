Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-6649:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image implementation within the Blink/Webkit rendering engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core issue is that memory allocated for an SVG image is being accessed after it has been freed. This leads to memory corruption and potential crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory corruption:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, which can result in unpredictable behavior of the browser.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:**  A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
*   **Browser crashes:**  Less severe outcomes would involve browser crashes due to accessing freed memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SVG Image:**  The primary attack vector is through the use of a specially crafted malicious SVG image. This image can be embedded in a web page or directly loaded into the browser.
*   **Web Browsing:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a user browsing a web page containing a malicious SVG image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious SVG:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious SVG image that can trigger the use-after-free condition in the browser's SVG parsing and rendering code.
*   **Web Hosting or Injection:** The attacker would need to host the malicious SVG file on a website they control or inject the crafted SVG into a site visited by the victim.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is necessary in that the victim must navigate to a webpage containing the malicious SVG file to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Credit:** The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Atte Kettunen of OUSPG.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was addressed in Chrome version 32.0.1700.102 and in Chromium browser version 32.0.1700.123-1.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability was classified as "High" severity.
*   **Reward:** A reward of $1000 was issued for the discovery of this vulnerability.
