  ###### high

  Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.1.8 has Incorrect Access Control. Project-level access control configuration was introduced in Enterprise Config schema version 8. Migration functionality from schema version 8 to versions 9 and 10 (in affected vulnerable versions) does not include the projects section of the configuration. This leads to all of the project settings being reset to their defaults when the old schema is loaded. In the case of projects.enabled, the default is false. Thus, using an enterprise config v8 results in Project level access control being disabled, even if it was previously enabled, and previously restricted project information disclosed. Most commonly, this occurs when a Develocity instance is upgraded from an earlier version. Specifically, this occurs if: Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2023.4.X; Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7; or Develocity 2023.4.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7. The flaw does not occur when upgrading to a fixed version. An upgrade can only be triggered via administrator access, and cannot be forced by an external attacker.
* ##### [CVE-2024-11090](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-11090)

  ###### medium

  The Membership Plugin – Restrict Content plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.13 via the WordPress core search feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator.
* ##### [CVE-2024-10705](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10705)

  ###### medium

  The Multiple Page Generator Plugin – MPG plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.5 via the 'mpg\_download\_file\_by\_link' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.
* ##### [CVE-2025-24858](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-24858)

  ###### high

  Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.3.1 allows an attacker who has network access to a Develocity server to obtain the hashed password of the system user. The hash algorithm used by Develocity was chosen according to best practices for password storage and provides some protection against brute-force attempts. The applicable severity of this vulnerability depends on whether a Develocity server is accessible by external or unauthorized users, and the complexity of the System User password.
* ##### [CVE-2024-10636](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10636)

  ###### medium

  The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘content’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
* ##### [CVE-2024-10633](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10633)

  ###### high

  The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency). This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do\_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
* ##### [CVE-2024-10628](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10628)

  ###### high

  The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
* ##### [CVE-2024-10574](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10574)

  ###### high

  The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ays\_save\_google\_credentials' function in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the Google Sheets integration credentials within the plugin's settings. Because the 'client\_id' parameter is not sanitized or escaped when used in output, this vulnerability could also be leveraged to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
* ##### [CVE-2022-49043](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-49043)

  ###### high

  xmlXIncludeAddNode in xinclude.c in libxml2 before 2.11.0 has a use-after-free.
* ##### [CVE-2025-0543](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-0543)

  ###### high

  Local privilege escalation in G DATA Security Client due to incorrect assignment of privileges to directories. This vulnerability allows a local, unprivileged attacker to escalate privileges on affected installations by placing an arbitrary executable in a globally writable directory resulting in execution by the SetupSVC.exe service in the context of SYSTEM.

  ###### medium

  Nuxt is an open-source web development framework for Vue.js. Source code may be stolen during dev when using version 3.0.0 through 3.15.12 of the webpack builder or version 3.12.2 through 3.152 of the rspack builder and a victim opens a malicious web site. Because the request for classic script by a script tag is not subject to same origin policy, an attacker can inject a malicious script in their site and run the script. By using `Function::toString` against the values in `window.webpackChunknuxt\_app`, the attacker can get the source code. Version 3.15.13 of Nuxt patches this issue.

# Supermicro IPMI Firmware Vulnerabilities

* Nov 06, 2013
* 4 min read
* [HD Moore](/blog/author/hd-moore/)

*Last updated at Thu, 28 Dec 2023 18:42:19 GMT*

## Introduction

This post summarizes the results of a limited security analysis of the Supermicro IPMI firmware. This firmware is used in the baseboard management controller (BMC) of many Supermicro motherboards.

The majority of our findings relate to firmware version SMT\_X9\_226. The information in this post was provided to Supermicro on August 22nd, 2013 in accordance with the Rapid7 vulnerability disclosure policy.

Although we have a number of Metasploit modules in development to test these issues, they are not quite ready for production use yet, so stay tuned for next week's Metasploit update. At our last count, over 35,000 Supermicro IPMI interfaces were exposed to the public internet.

Supermicro has published a new firmware version (SMT\_X9\_315) that appears to address many of the issues listed identified below, as well those reported by other researchers. We have updated each entry to indicate how the new firmware version impacts these issues.

A cursory review of the new firmware shows significant improvements, but we still recommend disconnecting the IPMI interface from untrusted networks and limiting access through another form of authentication (VPN, etc).

## Static Encryption Keys (CVE-2013-3619)

The firmware ships with harcoded private encryption keys for both the Lighttpd web server SSL interface and the Dropbear SSH daemon. An attacker with access to the publicly available Supermicro firmware can perform man-in-the-middle and offline decryption of communication to the firmware. The SSL keys can be updated by the user, but there is no option available to replace or regenerate SSH keys.

We have not been able to determine if firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 resolves this issue.

## Hardcoded WSMan Credentials (CVE-2013-3620)

The firmware contains two sets of credentials for the OpenWSMan interface. The first is the digest authentication file, which contains a single account with a static password. This password cannot be changed by the user and is effectively a backdoor. The second involves the basic authentication password file stored in the nv partition – it appears that due to a bug in the firmware, changing the password of the ADMIN account leaves the OpenWSMan password unchanged (still set to admin).

We have not been able to determine if firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 resolves this issue.

## CGI: login.cgi (CVE-2013-3621)

The login.cgi CGI application is vulnerable to two buffer overflows. The first occurs when processing the name parameter, the value is copied with strcpy() into a 128 byte buffer without any length checks. The second issue relates to the pwd parameter, the value is copied with strcpy() into a 24 byte buffer without any length checks. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities would result in remote code execution as the root user account. The vulnerable code is shown below (auto-generated from IDA Pro HexRays).

```
if ( cgiGetVariable("name") )
{
  v2 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("name");
  strcpy(&dest, v2);
}
if ( cgiGetVariable("pwd") )
{
  v3 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("pwd");
  strcpy(&v13, v3);
}

```

Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 removes the use of strcpy() and limits the length of the name and pwd values to 64 and 20 respectively.

## CGI: close\_window.cgi (CVE-2013-3623)

The close\_window.cgi CGI application is vulnerable to two buffer overflows. The first issue occurs when processing the sess\_sid parameter, this value is copied with strcpy() to a 20-byte stack buffer without any length checks. The second issue occurs when processing the ACT parameter, this value is copied with strcpy() to a 20-byte stack buffer without any length checks. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities would result in remote code execution as the root user account. The vulnerable code is shown below (auto-generated from IDA Pro HexRays).

```
if ( cgiGetVariable("sess_sid") )
{
  v1 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("sess_sid");
  strcpy(&v19, v1);
}

...
if ( cgiGetVariable("ACT") )
{
  v3 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("ACT");
  strcat(&nptr, v3);
  ...

```

Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 completely removes this CGI from the web interface.

## CGI: logout.cgi (CVE-2013-3622) [ authenticated ]

The logout.cgi CGI application is vulnerable to two buffer overflows. The first occurs when processing the SID parameter, the value is copied with strcpy() into a 20 byte buffer without any length checks. The second issue relates to further use of the SID parameter, the value is appended with strcat() into a 32 byte buffer without any length checks. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities would result in remote code execution as the root user account.The vulnerable code is shown below (auto-generated from IDA Pro HexRays).

```
if ( cgiGetVariable("SID") )
{
  v4 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("SID");
  strcpy(&s, v4);
}

```

Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 switches to a GetSessionCookie() function that limits the length of the SID variable returned to this code and no longer calls strcpy().

## CGI: url\_redirect.cgi (NO CVE) [ authenticated ]

The url\_redirect.cgi CGI application appears to be vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to lack of sanitization of the url\_name parameter. This may allow an attacker with a valid non-privileged account to access the contents of any file on the system. This includes the /nv/PSBlock file, which contains the clear-text credentials for all configured accounts, including the administrative user. The vulnerable code is shown below (auto-generated from IDA Pro HexRays).

```
sprintf(&v23, "%s/%s", *(_DWORD *)&ext_name_table[12 * i + 8], s);
v18 = fopen(&v23, "r");

```

Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 appears to fix this issue.

## CGI: miscellaneous (NO CVE) [ authenticated ]

Numerous unbounded strcpy(), memcpy(), and sprint() calls are performed by the other 65 CGI applications available through the web interface. Most of these applications verify that the user has a valid session first, limiting exposure to authenticated users, but the review was not comprehensive. All instances of unsafe string and system command handling should be reviewed and corrected as necessary. Exploitation of these issues allows a low-privileged user to gain root access to the device.

Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 has reorganized the web root, adding quite a few new CGI applications, removing many more, and generally purging the use of insecure functions like strcpy(). In addition, the config\_tftpd.cgi and snmp\_config.cgi CGI applications now validate that the user has a valid session first. They did not before, but it wasn't clear what risk this posed. In fact, the only two CGI applications that are now exposed to unauthenticated users are vmstatus.cgi and login.cgi.
