{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the handling of YAML tags during parsing.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow due to incorrect cast and integer overflow in the `yaml_parser_scan_tag_uri` function of libyaml when processing crafted YAML tags.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Application crash, potential arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application, denial of service",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can provide a specially crafted YAML document with excessively long tags that trigger the vulnerability when parsed by an application using libyaml.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a malicious YAML file to an application that uses a vulnerable version of libyaml for parsing."
