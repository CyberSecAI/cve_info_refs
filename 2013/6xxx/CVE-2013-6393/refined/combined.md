## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and
interaction with scripting languages. LibYAML is a YAML parser and emitter
written in C.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library parsed URLs
in YAML documents. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input to
an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2014-2525)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library handled
excessively long YAML tags. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML
input to application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2013-6393)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting the CVE-2014-2525 issue.
oCERT acknowledges Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team as the original
reporter. The CVE-2013-6393 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the
Red Hat Product Security Team.

All libyaml users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications linked against the libyaml library must be restarted for this
update to take effect.

An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has one
errata is now available.
Description:
perl-YAML-LibYAML was updated to fix three security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2013-6393: The yaml\_parser\_scan\_tag\_uri function in scanner.c in
LibYAML before 0.1.5 performed an incorrect cast, which allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which
triggered a heap-based buffer overflow (bnc#860617, bnc#911782).
- CVE-2014-9130: scanner.c in LibYAML 0.1.5 and 0.1.6, as used in the
YAML-LibYAML (aka YAML-XS) module for Perl, allowed context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and crash) via
vectors involving line-wrapping (bnc#907809, bnc#911782).
- CVE-2014-2525: Heap-based buffer overflow in the
yaml\_parser\_scan\_uri\_escapes function in LibYAML before 0.1.6 allowed
context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long
sequence of percent-encoded characters in a URI in a YAML file
(bnc#868944, bnc#911782).
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=868944#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2014-03-18 15:31:20 UTC  ``` via distros / OCERT, CRD March 26th  Hello,  I'd like to inform you about a LibYAML vulnerability that has been reported to oCERT and that is set for disclosure (with our own advisory) on the 26th of March around 18:00 GMT.  The vulnerability is a heap overflow and was confirmed on LibYAML 0.1.5 (latest version). The vulnerability is caused by not properly expanding a string before writing to it in function yaml_parser_scan_uri_escapes in scanner.c on the following line:          *(string->pointer++) = octet;  and can be triggered by parsing a .yaml file with a long sequence of percent-encoded charaters in a url. Attached to this message is a PoC .yaml file that demonstrates the vulnerability.  I am also attaching the patch provided by LibYAML author which has been verified by the reporter.  The issue has been discovered and reported by Ivan Fratric <ifratric@google.com> of the Google Security Team.  I should get a CVE assigned soon, I'll let you know when I get it.

## Updated yaml packages fix CVE-2013-6393

Publication date: 08 Feb 2014

Modification date: 08 Feb 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2013-6393](CVE-2013-6393.html)

## Description

```
Updated libyaml packages fix security vulnerabilities:

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a heap-based
buffer overflow flaw in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and emitter library.
A remote attacker could provide a YAML document with a specially-crafted tag
that, when parsed by an application using libyaml, would cause the application
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application (CVE-2013-6393).

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-11-25 01:11:44 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libyaml parsed YAML tags. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML document that, when parsed by an application using libyaml, would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c9)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-09 23:04:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 847926](attachment.cgi?id=847926&action=diff "String overflow patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=847926&action=edit "String overflow patch") String overflow patch  This is a proposed patch from Florian Weimer <fweimer> for the string overflow issue. It has been ack'd by upstream.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c10)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-09 23:13:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 847934](attachment.cgi?id=847934&action=diff "libyaml-node-id-hardening.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=847934&action=edit "libyaml-node-id-hardening.patch") libyaml-node-id-hardening.patch  This is a hardening patch also from Florian Weimer <fweimer>. It is not required to fix this CVE however it improves the robustness of the code against future issues by avoiding large node ID's in a central place.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c15)  John Eckersberg    2014-01-28 01:07:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 856317](attachment.cgi?id=856317&action=diff "libyaml-indent-column-overflow-v2.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=856317&action=edit "libyaml-indent-column-overflow-v2.patch") libyaml-indent-column-overflow-v2.patch  This expands upon the original indent column overflow patch from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c12).  The default parser indention is represented as an indention of -1.  The original patch only modified the type of the column parameter to the roll/unroll functions, changing it from int to size_t to guard against integer overflow.  However, there are code paths that call yaml_parser_unroll_indent with a column of -1 in order to reset the parser back to the initial indention.  Since the column is now of type size_t and thus unsigned, passing a column value of -1 caused the column to underflow in this case.  This new patch modifies the roll/unroll functions to handle the -1 indent as a special case.  In addition, it adds a new function, yaml_parser_reset_indent.  It is nearly an exact copy of yaml_parser_unroll_indent, except it does not take a column parameter.  Instead it unrolls to a literal -1 indention, which does not suffer from the underflow.  Code paths that previously called yaml_parser_unroll_indent with a column of -1 are updated to call the new yaml_parser_reset_indent function instead.  With this patch instead of the original:  - `make check` still passes  - The reproducer script completes successfully with exit code 0  - The issue raised by John Haxby has been corrected and exits with SUCCESS   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c17)  Murray McAllister    2014-01-29 00:45:16 UTC  ```  Created libyaml tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1059009](show_bug.cgi?id=1059009 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-6393 libyaml: heap-based buffer overflow when parsing YAML tags [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1059010](show_bug.cgi?id=1059010 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-6393 libyaml: heap-based buffer overflow when parsing YAML tags [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c20)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-29 08:57:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Red Hat security response team has rated this issue as having low security impact in Red Hat Enterpise MRG 1 and 2, CloudForms 3, and Red Hat Network Satellite 5.

## Topic

Updated ruby193-libyaml packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and
interaction with scripting languages. LibYAML is a YAML parser and emitter
written in C.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library parsed URLs
in YAML documents. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input to
an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2014-2525)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library handled
excessively long YAML tags. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML
input to application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2013-6393)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting the CVE-2014-2525 issue.
oCERT acknowledges Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team as the original
reporter. The CVE-2013-6393 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the
Red Hat Product Security Team.

All ruby193-libyaml users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications linked against the libyaml library must be restarted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Package        : libyaml-libyaml-perl
Vulnerability  : heap-based buffer overflow
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6393

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a
heap-based buffer overflow flaw in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and
emitter library. A remote attacker could provide a YAML document with a
specially-crafted tag that, when parsed by an application using libyaml,
would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.

This update corrects this flaw in the copy that is embedded in the
libyaml-libyaml-perl package.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.33-1+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.38-3+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.41-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.41-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your libyaml-libyaml-perl packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-11-25 01:11:44 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libyaml parsed YAML tags. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML document that, when parsed by an application using libyaml, would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c9)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-09 23:04:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 847926](attachment.cgi?id=847926&action=diff "String overflow patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=847926&action=edit "String overflow patch") String overflow patch  This is a proposed patch from Florian Weimer <fweimer> for the string overflow issue. It has been ack'd by upstream.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c10)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-09 23:13:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 847934](attachment.cgi?id=847934&action=diff "libyaml-node-id-hardening.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=847934&action=edit "libyaml-node-id-hardening.patch") libyaml-node-id-hardening.patch  This is a hardening patch also from Florian Weimer <fweimer>. It is not required to fix this CVE however it improves the robustness of the code against future issues by avoiding large node ID's in a central place.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c15)  John Eckersberg    2014-01-28 01:07:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 856317](attachment.cgi?id=856317&action=diff "libyaml-indent-column-overflow-v2.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=856317&action=edit "libyaml-indent-column-overflow-v2.patch") libyaml-indent-column-overflow-v2.patch  This expands upon the original indent column overflow patch from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c12).  The default parser indention is represented as an indention of -1.  The original patch only modified the type of the column parameter to the roll/unroll functions, changing it from int to size_t to guard against integer overflow.  However, there are code paths that call yaml_parser_unroll_indent with a column of -1 in order to reset the parser back to the initial indention.  Since the column is now of type size_t and thus unsigned, passing a column value of -1 caused the column to underflow in this case.  This new patch modifies the roll/unroll functions to handle the -1 indent as a special case.  In addition, it adds a new function, yaml_parser_reset_indent.  It is nearly an exact copy of yaml_parser_unroll_indent, except it does not take a column parameter.  Instead it unrolls to a literal -1 indention, which does not suffer from the underflow.  Code paths that previously called yaml_parser_unroll_indent with a column of -1 are updated to call the new yaml_parser_reset_indent function instead.  With this patch instead of the original:  - `make check` still passes  - The reproducer script completes successfully with exit code 0  - The issue raised by John Haxby has been corrected and exits with SUCCESS   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c17)  Murray McAllister    2014-01-29 00:45:16 UTC  ```  Created libyaml tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1059009](show_bug.cgi?id=1059009 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-6393 libyaml: heap-based buffer overflow when parsing YAML tags [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1059010](show_bug.cgi?id=1059010 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-6393 libyaml: heap-based buffer overflow when parsing YAML tags [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1033990#c20)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-29 08:57:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Red Hat security response team has rated this issue as having low security impact in Red Hat Enterpise MRG 1 and 2, CloudForms 3, and Red Hat Network Satellite 5.

An update that solves four vulnerabilities and has one
errata is now available.
Description:
perl-YAML-LibYAML was updated to version 0.59 to fix four security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2013-6393: The yaml\_parser\_scan\_tag\_uri function in scanner.c in
LibYAML before 0.1.5 performs an incorrect cast, which allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow (bnc#860617, bnc#911782).
- CVE-2012-1152: Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the error
reporting functionality in the YAML::LibYAML (aka YAML-LibYAML and
perl-YAML-LibYAML) module 0.38 for Perl allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (process crash) via format string specifiers
in a (1) YAML stream to the Load function, (2) YAML node to the
load\_node function, (3) YAML mapping to the load\_mapping function, or
(4) YAML sequence to the load\_sequence function (bnc#751503).
- CVE-2014-9130: scanner.c in LibYAML 0.1.5 and 0.1.6, as used in the
YAML-LibYAML (aka YAML-XS) module for Perl, allowed context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and crash) via
vectors involving line-wrapping (bnc#907809, bnc#911782).
- CVE-2014-2525: Heap-based buffer overflow in the
yaml\_parser\_scan\_uri\_escapes function in LibYAML before 0.1.6 allowed
context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long
sequence of percent-encoded characters in a URI in a YAML file
(bnc#868944, bnc#911782).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- PR/23 Better scalar dump heuristics
- More closely match YAML.pm
- Add a VERSION statement to YAML::LibYAML (issue#8)
- Applied fix for PR/21. nawglan++
- Use Swim cpan-tail block functions in doc
- Get YAML::XS using latest libyaml
- Fix for
<https://bitbucket.org/xi/libyaml/issue/10/wrapped-strings-cause-assert-fail>

A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML document that, when parsed by an application using libyaml, would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting this issue. oCERT acknowledges Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-19 07:09:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 876237](attachment.cgi?id=876237&action=diff "patch from upstream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=876237&action=edit "patch from upstream") patch from upstream   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-20 09:55:16 UTC  ``` libyaml is shipped as part of Red Hat Software Collections 1 via ruby193-libyaml package.  This package is used by ruby193-ruby.  Impact for this use case is limited, as ruby YAML module is unsafe for use on untrusted yaml input:  <http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html#module-YAML-label-Security>  Alternative SafeYAML modules which provide safe ways to load yaml input files in ruby is not provided as part of Red Hat Software Collections 1.  <https://github.com/dtao/safe_yaml>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c18)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-27 00:33:16 UTC  ``` This issue is public now:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2014-003.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c19)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-27 00:36:11 UTC  ```  Created libyaml tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1081281](show_bug.cgi?id=1081281 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-2525 libyaml: heap-based buffer overflow when parsing URLs [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c20)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-27 07:01:08 UTC  ``` Debian released <http://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-2885> to fix this issue in their libyaml-libyaml-perl package. perl-YAML-LibYAML for Fedora and EPEL look to embed libyaml too, and it seems to get built (<http://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/perl-YAML-LibYAML/0.41/3.fc20/data/logs/x86_64/build.log>), but I have not checked if it actually uses the embedded copy or not.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0354)

## Topic

Updated libyaml packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and
interaction with scripting languages. LibYAML is a YAML parser and emitter
written in C.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library parsed URLs
in YAML documents. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input to
an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2014-2525)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library handled
excessively long YAML tags. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML
input to application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2013-6393)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting the CVE-2014-2525 issue.
oCERT acknowledges Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team as the original
reporter. The CVE-2013-6393 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the
Red Hat Product Security Team.

All libyaml users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications linked against the libyaml library must be restarted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

  -
  [0.1.4-2ubuntu0.13.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libyaml/0.1.4-2ubuntu0.13.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [libyaml-0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libyaml)
  -
  [0.1.4-2ubuntu0.12.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libyaml/0.1.4-2ubuntu0.12.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

emitter library. A remote attacker could provide a YAML document with a
specially-crafted tag that, when parsed by an application using libyaml,
would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.3-1+deb6u2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.4-2+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.4-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libyaml packages.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# CVE-2013-6393

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2013-6391.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2013-6394.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2013-6393 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6393)

#### Description

The yaml\_parser\_scan\_tag\_uri function in scanner.c in LibYAML before 0.1.5 performs an incorrect cast, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
