How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Corrected explanatory text to refer to the correct patch filename.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  An internal flag is used to temporarily suppress IOMMU TLB flushes, in order to consolidate multiple single page flushes into one wider flush.  This flag is not cleared again, on certain error paths.  This can result in TLB flushes not happening when they are needed. Retaining stale TLB entries could allow guests access to memory that ought to have been revoked, or grant greater access than intended.  IMPACT ======  Malicious guest administrators might be able to cause host-wide denial of service, or escalate their privilege to that of the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only VMs which have been assigned PCI devices can exploit the bug.  Only systems using Intel VT-d are vulnerable, since the bug is in the VT-d specific code in Xen.  Xen 4.2.x and later are vulnerable. Xen 4.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices to untrusted guests on systems supporting Intel VT-d.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa80.patch                Xen 4.2.x, Xen 4.3.x, xen-unstable  $ sha256sum xsa80*.patch d15e627c59dd48e1cacb2fbcd5e2148975daa426df1f693b991d69201c048e77  xsa80.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJSpw/SAAoJEIP+FMlX6CvZu48IAIsJz4NRVXqCYl9hjtFhgfhL /V2J9T9Xp0/iNTmfP6FMu2wIZohAcosMOaZ5NXouIb50bta2mpeQhA0K0RZLEin5 2QH9rcfYYchAeQjPt72QVPH3iMTWdPXXV3HDuqXI+G+II64bonHvArtAwYxeJpWM ZwegEnxsEk2YsYk+TYGMzQws2sXygx06JxEJsE9/Q6BOJG9jnwvtRsleVDuMuBMR 6U1DdaxZohk5k1xqS5Y6udyXpJQgob7fMdwAoLWxxlb7vB3kOgzMoorVrzRZ0LcZ LmqBYxdCQRV+Tn19eE9xo1LjBr9qBS13nGDQbyIADoF85N/SmZoMycRsqunUQ2U= =rB23 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  ```  **Attachment: [xsa80.patch](binK8ZQIeVuYt.bin)** *Description:* Binary data  ``` _______________________________________________ Xen-announce mailing list Xen-announce@xxxxxxxxxxxxx <http://lists.xen.org/xen-announce> ```    ---      * Prev by Date:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 77 - Disaggregated domain management security status](msg00001.html)** * Previous by thread:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 77 - Disaggregated domain management security status](msg00001.html)** * Index(es):   + [**Date**](index.html#00002)   + [**Thread**](threads.html#00002) |

An update that solves 12 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 3 Xen
hypervisor and toolset has been updated to 4.2.4 to fix
various bugs and security issues:
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-60: CVE-2013-2212: The vmx\_set\_uc\_mode function
in Xen 3.3 through 4.3, when disabling chaches, allows
local HVM guests with access to memory mapped I/O regions
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly
hypervisor or guest kernel panic) via a crafted GFN range.
(bnc#831120)
\*
XSA-80: CVE-2013-6400: Xen 4.2.x and 4.3.x, when
using Intel VT-d and a PCI device has been assigned, does
not clear the flag that suppresses IOMMU TLB flushes when
unspecified errors occur, which causes the TLB entries to
not be flushed and allows local guest administrators to
cause a denial of service (host crash) or gain privileges
via unspecified vectors. (bnc#853048)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\*
XSA-83: CVE-2014-1642: The IRQ setup in Xen 4.2.x and
4.3.x, when using device passthrough and configured to
support a large number of CPUs, frees certain memory that
may still be intended for use, which allows local guest
administrators to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption and hypervisor crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via vectors related to an out-of-memory
error that triggers a (1) use-after-free or (2) double
free. (bnc#860092)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1891: The FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL,
FLASK\_USER and FLASK\_CONTEXT\_TO\_SID suboperations of the
flask hypercall are vulnerable to an integer overflow on
the input size. The hypercalls attempt to allocate a buffer
which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore
vulnerable to integer overflow and an attempt to allocate
then access a zero byte buffer. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1892 CVE-2014-1893: Xen 3.3 through
4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a
different overflow issue on FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL and expose
unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests.
(bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1894: Xen 3.2 (and presumably
earlier) exhibit both problems with the overflow issue
being present for more than just the suboperations listed
above. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-85: CVE-2014-1895: The FLASK\_AVC\_CACHESTAT
hypercall, which provides access to per-cpu statistics on
the Flask security policy, incorrectly validates the CPU
for which statistics are being requested. (bnc#860165)
\*
XSA-86: CVE-2014-1896: libvchan (a library for
inter-domain communication) does not correctly handle
unusual or malicious contents in the xenstore ring. A
malicious guest can exploit this to cause a libvchan-using
facility to read or write past the end of the ring.
(bnc#860300)
\*
XSA-87: CVE-2014-1666: The do\_physdev\_op function in
Xen 4.1.5, 4.1.6.1, 4.2.2 through 4.2.3, and 4.3.x does not
properly restrict access to the (1) PHYSDEVOP\_prepare\_msix
and (2) PHYSDEVOP\_release\_msix operations, which allows
local PV guests to cause a denial of service (host or guest
malfunction) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#860302)
\*
XSA-88: CVE-2014-1950: Use-after-free vulnerability
in the xc\_cpupool\_getinfo function in Xen 4.1.x through
4.3.x, when using a multithreaded toolstack, does not
properly handle a failure by the xc\_cpumap\_alloc function,
which allows local users with access to management
functions to cause a denial of service (heap corruption)
and possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#861256)
Also the following non-security bugs have been fixed:
\* Fixed boot problems with Xen kernel. "(XEN) setup
0000:00:18.0 for d0 failed (-19)" (bnc#858311)
\* Fixed Xen hypervisor panic on 8-blades nPar with
46-bit memory addressing. (bnc#848014)
\* Fixed Xen hypervisor panic in HP's UEFI x86\_64
platform and with xen environment, in booting stage.
(bnc#833251)
\* xend/pvscsi: recognize also SCSI CDROM devices
(bnc#863297)
\* pygrub: Support (/dev/xvda) style disk specifications

             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-6400 / XSA-80
                              version 3

          IOMMU TLB flushing may be inadvertently suppressed

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

Corrected explanatory text to refer to the correct patch filename.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

An internal flag is used to temporarily suppress IOMMU TLB flushes, in
order to consolidate multiple single page flushes into one wider
flush.  This flag is not cleared again, on certain error paths.  This
can result in TLB flushes not happening when they are needed.
Retaining stale TLB entries could allow guests access to memory that
ought to have been revoked, or grant greater access than intended.

IMPACT
======

Malicious guest administrators might be able to cause host-wide denial of
service, or escalate their privilege to that of the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only VMs which have been assigned PCI devices can exploit the bug.

Only systems using Intel VT-d are vulnerable, since the bug is in the
VT-d specific code in Xen.

Xen 4.2.x and later are vulnerable.
Xen 4.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices to untrusted guests on
systems supporting Intel VT-d.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.
