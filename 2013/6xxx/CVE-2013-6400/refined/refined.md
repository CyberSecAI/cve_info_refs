{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An internal flag used to temporarily suppress IOMMU TLB flushes for consolidating single-page flushes into wider flushes is not cleared on certain error paths.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The failure to clear the flag results in TLB flushes not occurring when needed, leading to stale TLB entries.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Malicious guest administrators can potentially cause a host-wide denial of service or escalate their privileges to that of the host.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by malicious guest administrators.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a guest administrator of a VM that has been assigned PCI devices and runs on systems using Intel VT-d."
