{
  "CVE-2013-6044": {
    "Description": "The `is_safe_url` function in Django versions 1.4.x before 1.4.6, 1.5.x before 1.5.2, and 1.6 before beta 2 treats a URL's scheme as safe even if it is not HTTP or HTTPS. This might introduce cross-site scripting (XSS) or other vulnerabilities into Django applications that use this function. The vulnerability is demonstrated using the `javascript:` scheme within the login view in `django.contrib.auth.views`.",
    "Root cause": "The `is_safe_url` function incorrectly parses URLs and permits redirects to non-HTTP/HTTPS schemes, like `javascript:`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of URL schemes in the `is_safe_url` function.",
      "Failure to reject potentially dangerous schemes like `javascript:`."
    ],
    "Impact": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by redirecting users to malicious URLs. In vulnerable applications, this could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser.",
    "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted URLs in query string parameters, especially those used for redirects after successful actions like login.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to insert malicious URLs into the application, typically by manipulating query parameters, which can be done remotely."
