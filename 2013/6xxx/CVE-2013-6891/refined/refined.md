Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `lppasswd` tool within the CUPS (Common Unix Printing System). Specifically, the `lppasswd` tool incorrectly reads a user configuration file when it is run setuid in certain configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Privilege Management:** The `lppasswd` tool, when running setuid, doesn't properly restrict its access to user configuration files.
- **Information Disclosure:** Due to the incorrect file reading, a local attacker can potentially access sensitive information that they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** A successful exploit could allow a local attacker to read sensitive information from files that would normally be protected by access restrictions.
- **Bypassing Access Restrictions:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass normal access controls and read data from files they are not authorized to access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system to execute the `lppasswd` tool.
- **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker likely needs a basic understanding of the system's file structure and how the `lppasswd` tool interacts with user configuration files.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Jann Horn.
- The fix involves modifying the `cups/usersys.c` file to prevent parsing of user files when the `lppasswd` binary is running with setuid permissions.
- Several distributions including Ubuntu and Mageia were affected and released patches to address this vulnerability.
- The fix is included in CUPS version 1.7.1.
