Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2013-6450:

**1. Vulnerability Description**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) retransmission in OpenSSL. Specifically, the code fails to properly maintain data structures for digest and encryption contexts when retransmitting messages.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness lies in the incorrect handling of digest and encryption contexts during DTLS retransmission. The vulnerability is located in `ssl/d1_both.c` and `ssl/t1_enc.c` files in OpenSSL.
*   **Impact:** This allows a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker to interfere with packet delivery. By doing so, the attacker can trigger the use of a different context than expected which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition where the application crashes.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker interferes with packet delivery to trigger a different context use.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and manipulate network packets between a client and a server that are using DTLS.

**2. Affected Software/Versions**

*   OpenSSL versions **1.0.0 prior to 1.0.0l** and **1.0.1 prior to 1.0.1f** are vulnerable.
*   OpenSSL versions 0.9.8 and earlier are **not** affected.

**3. Fix Information**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in OpenSSL versions **1.0.0l** and **1.0.1f.**
*   Patches were made available upstream, including the following commits:
    *   <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=34628967f1e65dc8f34e000f0f5518e21afbfc7b>
    *   <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=a6c62f0c25a756c263a80ce52afbae888028e986>
    *   <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=f3dcc8411e518fb0835c7d72df4a58718205260d>
*   Distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, and SUSE have issued updates to address the vulnerability.

**4. Specific Impacts**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is that an attacker can cause a vulnerable application using OpenSSL with DTLS to crash.
*  **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack**: By interfering with packet delivery, an attacker can force the application to use an incorrect context.

**5. Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is specific to DTLS connections and does not affect SSL/TLS connections.
*   The issue was introduced with the addition of Next Protocol Negotiation (NPN) support in version 1.0.1.
* Red Hat specifically mentioned that OpenSSL versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier were not affected.
* The vulnerability can occur due to packet loss or deliberate interference with packet delivery.
* SUSE reported crashes with a patched openssl that had only a partial fix, indicating that the fix requires applying multiple commits.
* Some of the documents mention that while the vulnerability could lead to a denial of service, the risk is lower when proper security controls and application logic are used.
* The severity is generally rated as moderate to high depending on the vendor.

In summary, CVE-2013-6450 is a significant vulnerability related to how OpenSSL handles DTLS retransmissions, potentially leading to DoS attacks through MitM packet interference. The vulnerability is fixed in OpenSSL versions 1.0.0l and 1.0.1f, and various Linux distributions provided updated packages for their affected versions.
