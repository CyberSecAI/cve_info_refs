  "CVE-2013-6282": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2013-6282",
      "Description": "A flaw was discovered in the get_user and put_user API functions in the Linux kernel on ARM platforms. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrator privileges.",
      "References": [
        "https://www.ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-2067-1",
        "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/11/14/11",
        "https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/arch/arm/include/asm/uaccess.h?id=8404663f81d212918ff85f493649a7991209fa04",

      ]
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is due to missing access checks in the `get_user` and `put_user` API functions when the kernel is compiled without `CPU_USE_DOMAINS`.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Missing bounds check on user-provided address when accessing memory in the kernel",
         "Incorrect usage of macros for copying data from user to kernel memory"
      ],
      "Impact": "An unprivileged local user can exploit this flaw to read and write arbitrary kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation and potentially gaining administrative privileges. The exploit can also be used to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.",
      "Attack Vectors": "A local user can execute a specially crafted program to trigger the flaw.",
      "Required Capabilities": "An unprivileged local user account is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.",
      "Technical Details": "The `get_user` and `put_user` macros are used to access user-space memory from the kernel. When `CPU_USE_DOMAINS` is not enabled, the assembly code implementing the macros lacks checks to verify the address against the user-space bounds, allowing an attacker to provide kernel space addresses and gain access."
