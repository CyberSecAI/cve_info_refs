Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-6835:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `facetime-audio://` URL scheme in iOS 7 allowed a website to initiate a FaceTime audio call without user confirmation. Safari didn't prompt the user before establishing the call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of user confirmation: The core issue is that Safari didn't prompt the user before initiating a FaceTime Audio call via the vulnerable URL scheme.
- Vulnerable URL Scheme: The `facetime-audio://` URL scheme was exploitable due to the lack of user interaction required to initiate calls.
- Cross-App Request Forgery (CSRF): The vulnerability can be triggered via an inline frame, similar to a CSRF attack, across applications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privacy violation:** The user's phone number or email address associated with their FaceTime account was revealed to the attacker.
- **Unintended call:** The user would be forced to call the attacker's specified number or email address, thus revealing their identity.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious website:** An attacker could embed the malicious `facetime-audio://` URL within a website using an iframe. When a user browsed this website, the call would be initiated without their knowledge or consent.
- **Malicious link:** A malicious link could be sent to the user. If clicked the call would be initiated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a web page or deliver a link with the malicious URL scheme.
- No special privileges on the user's device are needed.
- The attacker only needs the victim to access the malicious web page using a vulnerable version of iOS.

The information from `support.apple.com_d297c7db_20250125_195004.html` confirms that this CVE is related to a `TelephonyUI Framework` issue and was fixed by adding a confirmation prompt. It also confirms that Safari was not consulting the user before launching `facetime-audio://` URLs.
The information from `support.apple.com_5de70636_20250125_195006.html` confirms that the vulnerability was also present in `Data Detectors`, where tapping on a FaceTime link in mail would trigger the audio call without prompting.

The fix for this vulnerability was to add a user prompt to the FaceTime audio call initiation process. This patch was released in iOS 7.1 and later.
