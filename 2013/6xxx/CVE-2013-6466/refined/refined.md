Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-6466:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference within the Openswan IKE daemon (pluto). This occurs when the daemon attempts to process IKEv2 packets that are missing expected payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476):** The core issue is that the code doesn't properly check for the presence of expected IKEv2 payloads before attempting to access them, leading to a dereference of a NULL pointer if those payloads are missing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation causes the pluto daemon to crash, leading to a denial of service. This also results in the dropping of existing VPN connections as the IKE daemon is responsible for establishing and maintaining them.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable by remote, unauthenticated attackers.
*   **IKEv2 Packets:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted IKEv2 packets that lack certain expected payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable system.
*   **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. Any remote user can send these packets.
*   **IKEv2 Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malformed IKEv2 packets, which would require knowledge of the IKEv2 protocol.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects Openswan versions prior to the fix. Specifically, the provided information mentions that Openswan 2.6.39 and earlier are vulnerable, and the fix was backported from Libreswan.
*   **Mitigation:**  The vulnerability is mitigated by applying the provided patches or upgrading to fixed versions of the affected software. Setting `ikev2=never` or `ikev2=no` in the `ipsec.conf` file can also avoid the vulnerable code path by forcing IKEv1.
*   **Openswan/Libreswan Relationship:** It's noted that Libreswan is a fork of Openswan and they share some code. The fix was initially created for Libreswan and then backported to Openswan.
*   **Red Hat Specifics:** Red Hat has released a security advisory (RHSA-2014:0185) to address this vulnerability for their affected products. It is also noted that a later version of openswan (2.6.40) did not fully fix the issue, and subsequently received a separate CVE (CVE-2014-2037).
*   **CVSS:** The CVSS score is 7.5 (High) according to the cert.vde.com document, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, indicating a remotely exploitable DoS. The libreswan.org document lists a CVSS2 score of 5.0, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P.
*  **Debian Specifics:** Debian also released a security advisory (DSA-2893-1) to address this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2013-6466 describes a remotely exploitable vulnerability where a missing IKEv2 payload causes a NULL pointer dereference and DoS.
