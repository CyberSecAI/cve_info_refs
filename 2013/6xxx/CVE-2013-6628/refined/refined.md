Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2013-6628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an issue where certificates are not properly checked during TLS renegotiation. This allows a different, unverified certificate to be used after a successful TLS renegotiation using a valid certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Certificate Validation:** The primary weakness lies in the failure to validate certificates during TLS renegotiation. Specifically, the browser doesn't enforce the continuity of the certificate used at the start of the connection and during the renegotiation phase.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker could potentially perform a MitM attack. They could initially establish a secure connection using a valid certificate. Then, during the TLS renegotiation, the attacker could substitute their own certificate without the browser detecting the change.
- **Data Interception/Manipulation:** This allows the attacker to potentially intercept and manipulate the data being transmitted between the user and the legitimate server, as the connection is no longer truly secure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **TLS Renegotiation:** The attack is carried out during the TLS renegotiation process. The attacker would need to initiate this process after a secure connection has already been established.
- **Network-Level Positioning:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between the client (browser) and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user and the targeted server. This could be done by being on the same network or by having the capability to route traffic.
- **Active Man-in-the-Middle Position:**  They must be able to actively modify the traffic during the TLS renegotiation process.
- **Malicious Certificate:**  The attacker requires a certificate that will be presented during renegotiation, which will not be correctly validated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Karthikeyan Bhargavan of INRIA Paris.
- The fix involves updating Chromium to version 31.0.1650.57, which includes the necessary security fix.
