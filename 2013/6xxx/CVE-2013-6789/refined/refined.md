Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** The provided content references CVE-2013-2653, not CVE-2013-6789. Therefore, this content is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2013-6789.

However, we can still analyze the vulnerability described.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The SilverStripe CMS application was susceptible to information exposure through query strings in GET requests. Specifically, the login form allowed email and password parameters to be passed directly within the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Information Exposure:** Sensitive information (email and password) was exposed in the URL.
-   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application did not properly handle or sanitize credentials passed through URL query parameters.
-   **Lack of proper HTTP method enforcement:** The login form did not enforce POST requests, allowing credentials to be submitted through GET requests.
-   **CWE-598** Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker could craft a malicious link containing a victim's email and password in the query string.
-   If the victim clicks the link, they would be automatically logged into the SilverStripe CMS, potentially granting the attacker access to the system's admin section within the victimâ€™s session.
-   This could be exploited using a crafted iframe to log in a user without their notice.
-   Unauthorised access to admin section.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Social Engineering:** An attacker would need to trick a valid user into clicking a specially crafted URL.
-   **Malicious Links:** The attack vector is a crafted URL with credentials passed as query parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL.
-   The attacker needs knowledge of a valid user's email and password or a way to obtain them.
-   The attacker needs to socially engineer a user to click the malicious link.
