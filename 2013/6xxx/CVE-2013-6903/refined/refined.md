Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-6903:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the presence of multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within Cybozu Garoon groupware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), specifically CWE-79. The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in web pages, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts within the user's web browser. This could potentially allow attackers to steal cookies, session tokens, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect them to malicious sites, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface of Cybozu Garoon. Attackers would inject malicious scripts through user-supplied input fields that are not properly sanitized and then displayed on the web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not necessarily need prior authentication or be on the internal network. They can leverage the internet to deliver malicious payloads to vulnerable instances.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with a crafted link or view a page containing the malicious script.
* The exploitation complexity is considered high, which means that the user needs to be convinced to take a difficult or suspicious action.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects Cybozu Garoon versions 3.7 Service Pack 1 and earlier.
* The provided documents list CVE-2013-6903 alongside other related CVEs (CVE-2013-6900 to CVE-2013-6916), suggesting a series of similar XSS issues within the product.
* The analysis by JPCERT/CC indicates that the attacks can be carried out over the internet, without requiring authentication.
* User interaction is required to trigger the XSS, involving actions such as clicking links or viewing files.
