Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-6720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `delivery.php` script of IBM Tealeaf CX. Specifically, the `testconn_host` parameter is vulnerable to OS command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote OS Command Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `testconn_host` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication, making it easier to exploit.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The provided information also mentions a separate LFI vulnerability at `/download.php?log=../../etc/passwd`. This is not directly related to CVE-2013-6720 but is a related vulnerability in the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could use the command injection to access and steal sensitive data from the server.
*   **System Disruption:**  The attacker could disrupt the availability and integrity of the system by injecting commands that could damage or disable server functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a specific HTTP POST request to the `delivery.php` endpoint.
*   **`testconn_host` parameter:** The malicious payload is embedded within the `testconn_host` parameter within the POST data.
*    The exploit code uses the following format: `8.8.8.8 -c 1 ; {COMMAND} ; ping 8.8.8.8 -c 1`. The `{COMMAND}` part is where the injected system command is placed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable IBM Tealeaf CX server.
*   **No Authentication:**  No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `delivery.php` endpoint to initiate the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code is written in Python and demonstrates how to exploit the command injection vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is present in IBM Tealeaf CX version 8 release 8 and likely prior versions.
*   The exploit code also includes a mention of a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, but this is a separate issue not directly tied to the command injection vulnerability described by CVE-2013-6720.
