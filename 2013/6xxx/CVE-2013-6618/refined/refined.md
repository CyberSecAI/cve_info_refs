{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The J-Web interface on Juniper Junos devices is vulnerable to remote code execution through the file `/jsdm/ajax/port.php`. This file allows execution of arbitrary user-supplied PHP code via the `rs` POST parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote code execution",
      "Privilege escalation",
      "Insecure handling of user-supplied data",
      "Lack of proper input validation",
	  "Unrestricted access to PHP execution functions"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code with root privileges (UID=0). Although confined within a chroot, attackers can escalate privileges by hijacking administrator sessions through reading the contents of `/tmp`.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote exploitation via HTTP POST requests to `/jsdm/ajax/port.php` with malicious PHP code in the `rs` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires read-only authentication to the J-Web interface. Attackers need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint."

  "additional_details": {
    "vulnerable_app": "Juniper Junos J-Web",
    "affected_versions": "All Junos OS software releases built prior to 2013-02-28",
    "solution": "Upgrade to Junos OS software releases built on or after 2013-02-28. As a workaround, disable J-Web or limit access to trusted hosts.",
	"poc": "Code execution: `POST /jsdm/ajax/port.php rs=exec&rsargs[]=echo “hello”`. Privilege escalation: `POST /jsdm/ajax/port.php rs=file_get_contents&rsargs[]=/tmp`"
