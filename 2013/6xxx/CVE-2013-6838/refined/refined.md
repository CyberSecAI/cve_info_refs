Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6838

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of a hardcoded SSH private key on affected Enghouse Interactive IVR Pro (VIP2000) systems. This private key is not protected by a passphrase, allowing anyone with access to the key to gain root access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded SSH Private Key:** The presence of a static, publicly available SSH private key within the IVR Pro system is the core weakness.
*   **Unprotected Private Key:** The lack of a passphrase on the private key further exacerbates the vulnerability, making it trivial to use if discovered.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The use of the hardcoded key bypasses normal authentication mechanisms to gain root level access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker complete administrative (root) access to the affected IVR Pro system.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  An attacker can use the compromised system as a launchpad for further attacks within the target infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability allows for remote exploitation, as the attacker can use the public key to authenticate through SSH.
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the affected system in order to connect via SSH using the private key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the existence of the hardcoded SSH private key and its corresponding public key, which was published as part of this advisory.
*   **SSH Client:** An attacker needs a standard SSH client to connect and authenticate to the vulnerable system.

**Affected Product:**
*   Enghouse Interactive IVR Pro/Contact Center (VIP2000) version 9.0.3 (rel903) with OpenVZ and fallback customization applied.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is located within an add-on product by Enghouse Interactive Professional Services, that uses OpenVZ.
* A patch was made available by the vendor, which involves an updated release of the OpenVZ fallback customization.
