      "root_cause": "The OpenStack Heat ReST API incorrectly overrides the request context tenant_id with the tenant_id found in the request path.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper tenant scoping in the Heat ReST API implementation.",

It includes details of the fix, which involves validating the context and path tenant IDs rather than overriding the context ID."
