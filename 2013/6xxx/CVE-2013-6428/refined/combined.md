security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-heat packages provide heat, a Python implementation of the
OpenStack Orchestration engine, to launch multiple composite cloud
applications based on templates.

It was found that heat did not properly enforce cloudformation-compatible
API policy rules. An in-instance attacker could use the CreateStack or
UpdateStack methods to create or update a stack, resulting in a violation
of the API policy. Note that only setups using Orchestration's
cloudformation-compatible API were affected. (CVE-2013-6426)

A flaw was found in the way Orchestration's REST API implementation handled
modified request paths. An authenticated remote user could use this flaw to
bypass the tenant-scoping restriction by modifying the request path,
resulting in privilege escalation. Note that only setups using
Orchestration's cloudformation-compatible API were affected.
(CVE-2013-6428)

Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for
reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Steven Hardy of Red Hat as
the original reporter.

The openstack-heat packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2013.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. The most notable fixes and enhancements are:

* Auto-scaling has been fixed when AdjustmentType was set to

PercentChangeInCapacity.

* A QPID broker restart no longer permanently disrupts subscribed clients.
* RPC requests are now only serviced by one server in a given topic group.
* Auto-scaling group growth or shrinkage has been fixed to utilize the full

available size, regardless of the scaling policy adjustment.

(BZ#1045430)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The outdated heat-db-setup tool, which only supported local installs, has

been removed. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4
Installation and Configuration Guide has been updated to show how to create
the necessary database and associated tables for Orchestration, allowing
the deployment of the database server on a local or remote system (see
Installing the OpenStack Orchestration Service). (BZ#1046326)

* The heat-engine source code had a hard-coded reference to a Fedora image

name in the implementation of the AWS-compatible LoadBalancer resource.
This meant that you could not specify an alternative LoadBalancer image
name in deployments (for example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux). A new option
has been added to the Orchestration configuration file,
/etc/heat/heat.conf, which is named loadbalancer\_template. The new
loadbalancer\_template option can now be used to specify an alternate
LoadBalancer template that contains a different image name. (BZ#1048215)

* Due to a packaging error, the heat-manage tool was not working properly

(which prohibited a successful database creation). This error has been
fixed by moving the parallel package selection code so that all
Orchestration tools now use the proper packages for use at runtime.
(BZ#1048335)

All openstack-heat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

ERROR: No module named sqlalchemy ERROR 1146 (42S02) at line 1: Table 'heat.migrate_version' doesn't exist Final sanity check failed. Please file a bug report on bugzilla.redhat.com against the openstack-heat package.  at this stage, there are 3 candidates for python-sqlalchemy:  - version 0.7 from epel6 that is actually installed - version 0.5 from rpm-updates. If installed conflicts with 0.7. - version 0.8 from epel6 that cannot be installed due to priority problems.  --- Additional comment from Pádraig Brady on 2014-01-03 12:47:23 EST ---  So this is an issue with low level heat-manage command needed in this work around situation. I'm guessing that heat-manage has not been updated to select the parallel installed version of sqlalchemy and that nova-manage has.  --- Additional comment from Pádraig Brady on 2014-01-03 13:41:58 EST ---  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openstack-heat.git/commit/?h=el6-havana&id=30463c61>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1048335#c1)  Steven Dake    2014-01-06 16:53:05 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1048334](show_bug.cgi?id=1048334 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - heat-manage doesn't work on EL") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1048335#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-01-22 18:34:00 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

### Bug Description

While working on the request-scoping-policy blueprint, I've discovered a flaw in the way the ReST API handles the tenant\_id that is part of the request path:

<https://github.com/openstack/heat/blob/master/heat/api/openstack/v1/util.py#L29>

Here we incorrectly override the request context tenant\_id (which is what we get from the keystone auth\_token middleware) with the tenant\_id in the request path.

This has the very bad side effect of meaning that anyone who can authenticate with the Heat ReST API can just change the path and trivially bypass the tenant scoping of the request.

Steps to reproduce:

- Optionally set token\_format = UUID in /etc/keystone/keystone.conf to make tokens easier to cut/paste

- Create two users, User1 and User2, in two different tenants

- Create some heat stacks with each user

- Do heat --debug stack-list with each user and note the stack IDs

- Copy one of the curl commands and modify the path to point at the other tenant

- Observe that e.g User1 can retrieve stacks from User2's tenant

Note the exact same X-Auth-Token is used in both cases, one from User1, but we can list User2's stack just by changing the path :(

So the simplest possible fix is to remove the line which overwrites the context tenant\_id:

<https://github.com/openstack/heat/blob/master/heat/api/openstack/v1/util.py#L29>

This just means the tenant\_id in the path is ignored, and User1 always gets the same data regardless of the tenant specified in the path (solving the immediate problem)

However we should probably consider a more robust fix, where we deny any request where the tenant\_id specified in the path doesn't match the tenant\_id in the context, either directly in the API, or via a policy rule (I'm working on making the ReST API policy.json aware atm).

Sounds like this issue needs a CVE, can anyone from the OpenStack VMT confirm? Thanks.

Steven: Does this affect Havana as well?

Kurt: Probably, but we usually don't file a formal CVE request until we bring the PTL up to speed on the issue and get a confirmation of impact.

Jeremy: Yes, this affects Havana - it actually looks like the bug has existed since we first implemented the ReST API, so Grizzly, Havana and master are all affected.

Thanks. Since Heat was first officially included in the OpenStack Havana release we'll just say "all supported versions" in the OSSA and include patches for stable/havana and master, but feel free to make a stable/grizzly backport if you want.

  [Edit](/heat/%2Bbug/1256983/%2Battachment/3921741)
  (2.7 KiB,
  text/plain)

This is an initial draft patch for discussion, still needs some test fixups to test\_api\_openstack\_v1.py.

Looking at the tests explains why this issue slipped through - the tests assume the engine will reject the response due to invalid tenant, but we've erased the real tenant associated with the request by overwriting the context, so this can never be true.

This simple patch just raises HTTPForbidden if the context and path tenant\_ids don't match, which is probably the easiest (to backport) solution. Then for master, we can move to potentially a more flexible policy based solution for Icehouse.

At the time this was written we were passing a username and password to the engine and checking credentials there; we had to add in the tenant from the URL because we didn't necessarily receive it in the request. Now that the only checking is done by the API middleware, this is obviously a horrible, horrible bug :(

The patch looks perfect for backporting; probably in the future we should refactor to do this check earlier and get rid of the tenant\_local nonsense altogether.

@Zane: Thanks for the feedback - yeah +1 on removing tenant\_local after we have the backports done - I'm thinking we can probably kill it during the move to policy based enforcement (have a new policy\_enforce decorator), but that looks probably too messy to backport due to dependence on other recently merged changes.

New patch coming soon with fixed-up tests.

I find it extremely unfortunate and depressing that our srt process is so slow that we have to release a milestone build without this critical fix - how can this not be a release blocker? :(

I did specifically point this bug out to Thierry. Now that milestone-proposed is branched I assume we can put this back on icehouse-1, and block release on it.

SteveBaker: our process unfortunately calls for early disclosure to a number of stakeholders (like distros) so this can't hit a public repo until that embargo period is over (which takes at least 4 days). So this will be post-i1. No big deal anyway, since i1 is just a tag marking the end of a icehouse development period... what would be nice would be to get it in havana 2013.2.1 though (next week).

Date: December 11, 2013
Title: Heat ReST API doesn't respect tenant scoping
Reporter: Steven Hardy (Red Hat)
Products: Heat
Affects: All supported releases

Description:
Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in the Heat ReST
API. By changing the request path, an authenticated client may
override their tenant scope resulting in privilege escalation. Only
setups exposing the Heat orchestration ReST interface are affected.

Icehouse (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/61455>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/61456>

Notes:

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c0)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2013-12-24 14:58:20 UTC  ``` I am not running or setting up heat on the same host as mysql and i don't want heat-db-setup to install a local copy of mysql again.  There are no visible options from command line to specify a remote mysql server.  This is a severe limitation that must be addressed ASAP as it's blocking HA refarch and related deployments.  Usage: heat-db-setup <rpm|deb> [options] Options:         select a distro type (rpm or debian)          --help        | -h                 Print usage information.         --password <pw> | -p <pw>                 Specify the password for the 'heat' MySQL user that  will                 use to connect to the 'heat' MySQL database.  By default,                 the password 'heat' will be used.         --rootpw <pw> | -r <pw>                 Specify the root MySQL password.  If the script installs                 the MySQL server, it will set the root password to this value                 instead of prompting for a password.  If the MySQL server is                 already installed, this password will be used to connect to the                 database instead of having to prompt for it.         --yes         | -y                 In cases where the script would normally ask for confirmation                 before doing something, such as installing mysql-server,                 just assume yes.  This is useful if you want to run the script                 non-interactively.  Also, this kind of tool is totally inconsistent with every single other tool in openstack to handle mysql connections.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c1)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2013-12-24 15:00:54 UTC  ``` Also, this is the first tool asking me for my mysqlroot password. All others tools are happy enough to have the admin create the basic db and grant user privileges.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c2)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2013-12-25 07:09:21 UTC  ``` Steve mentioned on IRC not to use this tool, but this is what we are advertising to customers:  <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_OpenStack_Platform/4/html/Installation_and_Configuration_Guide/sect-Configuring_the_Orchestration_Service.html>  as official tool to fill the db.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c3)  Steven Dake    2013-12-25 15:19:16 UTC  ``` Fabio,  When I reviewed the docs, I really just didn't think about openstack-utils in the context of installation.  It was clearly an oversight.  I believe the right answer is a zstream of the documentation modified to work with openstack-utils.  If there are gaps in openstack-utils for heat functionality, we should fill those first ;-)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c4)  Steven Dake    2013-12-25 15:22:03 UTC  ``` Jeff,  Can you see if openstack-utils can be used for the documented operations in the [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c2) link.  If so, please advise what the invocations are.  Note the priority is urgent (the bug has been triaged), so please have a look when you return from Christmas shutdown at your earliest convenience.  Thanks -steve   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c5)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2013-12-25 15:45:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Steven Dake from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c3)) > Fabio, >  > When I reviewed the docs, I really just didn't think about openstack-utils > in the context of installation.  It was clearly an oversight.  I believe the > right answer is a zstream of the documentation modified to work with > openstack-utils.  If there are gaps in openstack-utils for heat > functionality, we should fill those first ;-)  I am of course all up for fixing docs, but I also need ASAP the correct process to fill the DB for heat as this is a blocker for different reasons.  As you mentioned on IRC, if this tool is only for developers, then please don't ship it. It's just broken and has no reasons to exists :)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c6)  Jeff Peeler    2014-01-02 18:29:26 UTC  ``` I have confirmed that openstack-db is a suitable replacement for heat-db-setup. I took an existing RHOS installation, dropped the heat db, and then ran:  openstack-db --service heat --init --password <user pw> --rootpw <root pw>  Stack creation and listing was successful.  Examining both scripts seem to have the same functionality, except heat-db-setup logs slightly differently as indicated here: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/heat/+bug/1191925](https://bugs.launchpad.net/heat/%2Bbug/1191925). As noted in the bug though, this would only be a problem with log_dir defined, which in the package it isn't.   Note the following text from the openstack-db tool:  Set up a local database (MySQL) for use with openstack-<service>. This script will create a '<service>' database that is accessible only on localhost by user '<service>' with password '<service>'. The setup of a database with a multi-server OpenStack installation is outside of the scope of this simple helper script.  As far as I can tell using a remote database is not going to be achievable/supported when installing OpenStack manually.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c7)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-01-02 18:35:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeff Peeler from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c6)) > I have confirmed that openstack-db is a suitable replacement for > heat-db-setup.

Then I need a way to setup the heat db in a consistent way as other openstack services. Please take a look at how keystone or nova or glance db installation is documented and performed.  I can surely start from this few instructions and work around the limitations to move forward, but it is a terrible user experience to have to figure out how sql works internally to do scalable installations.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c8)  Steven Hardy    2014-01-02 19:10:27 UTC  ``` @Fabio Massimo Di Nitto   How are you initializing the DB for other OpenStack services?  Have you tried using "heat-manage db_sync", which is the supported way to create the DB schema, using the mysql connection details from /etc/heat/heat.conf?  AFAIK heat-manage db_sync is consistent with how all other openstack services work, but if it doesn't meet your requirements, please provide details explaining your use-case, and how it's achieved with other OpenStack services.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c9)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-01-03 00:19:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to Steven Hardy from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c8)) > @Fabio Massimo Di Nitto  >  > How are you initializing the DB for other OpenStack services?

No because it's not officially documented. This is not a test-and-try setup/exercise I am going through. This is a "take openstack and build it on top of High Availability/Load Balancer solution to implement into foreman/packstack" work.  >  > AFAIK heat-manage db_sync is consistent with how all other openstack > services work, but if it doesn't meet your requirements, please provide > details explaining your use-case, and how it's achieved with other OpenStack > services.  But it is not documented.. hence it's a moot point because who follows manual install will not find it :)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1046326#c10)  Steven Dake    2014-01-03 00:36:40 UTC  ``` I suggest we remove heat-db-setup from the distributed RPMs.  This bug will be used to track that activity.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
