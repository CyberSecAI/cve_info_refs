Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a session fixation issue in Cybozu Garoon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session fixation vulnerability: The application does not properly regenerate session IDs upon successful login, allowing an attacker to potentially hijack a user's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can impersonate a registered user.
- This impersonation can lead to the disclosure or alteration of information within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack can be carried out remotely over the internet via network packets.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to take an action such as clicking a link or viewing a file, likely to trick the user into using a pre-set session ID controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated (no prior access or credentials needed).
- The attacker needs some expertise to exploit the vulnerability, suggesting that crafting a malicious link and convincing a user to use it is non-trivial.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as having a "High" access and authentication severity, and a "Mid" user interaction required.
-  Exploit complexity is rated as "Mid-High"
