- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RuggedCom ROS-Based integrated Web server uses insufficiently random values for generating session IDs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficiently random session IDs (CWE-330).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can guess the session ID of an active web session and hijack it, potentially gaining access to administrative functions.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation over the network through the integrated web server on port 443/TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the client IP address of the administrator.
