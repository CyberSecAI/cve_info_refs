Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The LiveZilla application stored admin usernames and passwords in plaintext within an XML-based "1click" file. This file was intended for one-click login functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage:**  The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive credentials (usernames and passwords) in an easily readable, unencrypted format (plaintext) within an XML file.
- **Lack of Encryption:** The advisory explicitly states that "Base64 is not an encryption mechanism," highlighting the absence of any proper encryption or hashing for the stored credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Password Disclosure:** An attacker who gains access to the "1click" XML file can easily retrieve the admin's username and password in plaintext.
- **Unauthorized Access:**  With the compromised admin credentials, an attacker could gain full administrative access to the LiveZilla application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File Access:** The primary attack vector involves gaining local access to the file system where the vulnerable XML file is stored. This could be achieved through various means such as:
   - Direct access to the system
   - Exploitation of other vulnerabilities to gain file system access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the Windows system where the LiveZilla application is installed and where the XML file is stored.
- **File System Knowledge:**  The attacker must know the location of the XML based "onclick" file.
