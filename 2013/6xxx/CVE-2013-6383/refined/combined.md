# USN-2074-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

3 January 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-237-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-237.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-237.53)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](/security/CVE-2013-4470))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-35-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-35.50~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-35.50~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0285)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the qeth\_snmp\_command()

function in the Linux kernel's QETH network device driver implementation
handled SNMP IOCTL requests with an out-of-bounds length. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-6381, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the ipc\_rcu\_putref() function in the Linux

kernel's IPC implementation handled reference counter decrementing.
A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger an Out of Memory
(OOM) condition and, potentially, crash the system. (CVE-2013-4483,
Moderate)

* It was found that the Xen hypervisor implementation did not correctly

check privileges of hypercall attempts made by HVM guests, allowing
hypercalls to be invoked from protection rings 1 and 2 in addition to ring
0. A local attacker in an HVM guest able to execute code on privilege
levels 1 and 2 could potentially use this flaw to further escalate their
privileges in that guest. Note: Xen HVM guests running unmodified versions
of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Microsoft Windows are not affected by this
issue because they are known to only use protection rings 0 (kernel) and 3
(userspace). (CVE-2013-4554, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Adaptec RAID controller

(aacraid) checked permissions of compat IOCTLs. A local attacker could use
this flaw to bypass intended security restrictions. (CVE-2013-6383,
Moderate)

* It was found that, under specific circumstances, a combination of write

operations to write-combined memory and locked CPU instructions may cause a
core hang on certain AMD CPUs (for more information, refer to AMD CPU
erratum 793 linked in the References section). A privileged user in a guest
running under the Xen hypervisor could use this flaw to cause a denial of
service on the host system. This update adds a workaround to the Xen
hypervisor implementation, which mitigates the AMD CPU issue. Note: this
issue only affects AMD Family 16h Models 00h-0Fh Processors. Non-AMD CPUs
are not vulnerable. (CVE-2013-6885, Moderate)

* It was found that certain protocol handlers in the Linux kernel's

networking implementation could set the addr\_len value without initializing
the associated data structure. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to leak kernel stack memory to user space using the recvmsg, recvfrom,
and recvmmsg system calls. (CVE-2013-7263, Low)

* A flaw was found in the way the get\_dumpable() function return value was

interpreted in the ptrace subsystem of the Linux kernel. When
'fs.suid\_dumpable' was set to 2, a local, unprivileged local user could
use this flaw to bypass intended ptrace restrictions and obtain
potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-2929, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Vladimir Davydov of Parallels for reporting
CVE-2013-4483 and the Xen project for reporting CVE-2013-4554 and
CVE-2013-6885. Upstream acknowledges Jan Beulich as the original reporter
of CVE-2013-4554 and CVE-2013-6885.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds one enhancement.
Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
enhancement. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-237-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-237.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-237.53)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

NTB: Correct debugfs to work with more than 1 NTB Device
commit 1517a3f21a1dd321f16bcf44204bddff9d21abd0 upstream.
Debugfs was setup in NTB to only have a single debugfs directory. This
resulted in the leaking of debugfs directories and files when multiple
NTB devices were present, due to each device stomping on the variables
containing the previous device's values (thus preventing them from being
freed on cleanup). Correct this by creating a secondary directory of
the PCI BDF for each device present, and nesting the previously existing
information in those directories.

NTB: Add Error Handling in ntb\_device\_setup
commit 3b12a0d15bd1559e72ad21d9d807fd2a6706f0ab upstream.
If an error is encountered in ntb\_device\_setup, it is possible that the
spci\_cmd isn't populated. Writes to the offset can result in a NULL
pointer dereference. This issue is easily encountered by running in
NTB-RP mode, as it currently is not supported and will generate an
error. To get around this issue, return if an error is encountered
prior to attempting to write to the spci\_cmd offset.

seq\_file: always update file->f\_pos in seq\_lseek()
commit 05e16745c0c471bba313961b605b6da3b21a853d upstream.
This issue was first pointed out by Jiaxing Wang several months ago, but no
further comments:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/6/29/41
As we know pread() does not change f\_pos, so after pread(), file->f\_pos
and m->read\_pos become different. And seq\_lseek() does not update file->f\_pos
if offset equals to m->read\_pos, so after pread() and seq\_lseek()(lseek to
m->read\_pos), then a subsequent read may read from a wrong position, the
following program produces the problem:
char str1[32] = { 0 };
char str2[32] = { 0 };
int poffset = 10;
int count = 20;
/\*open any seq file\*/
int fd = open("/proc/modules", O\_RDONLY);
pread(fd, str1, count, poffset);
printf("pread:%s\n", str1);
/\*seek to where m->read\_pos is\*/
lseek(fd, poffset+count, SEEK\_SET);
/\*supposed to read from poffset+count, but this read from position 0\*/
read(fd, str2, count);
printf("read:%s\n", str2);
out put:
pread:
ck\_netbios\_ns 12665
read:
nf\_conntrack\_netbios
/proc/modules:
nf\_conntrack\_netbios\_ns 12665 0 - Live 0xffffffffa038b000
nf\_conntrack\_broadcast 12589 1 nf\_conntrack\_netbios\_ns, Live 0xffffffffa0386000
So we always update file->f\_pos to offset in seq\_lseek() to fix this issue.

mutex: Avoid gcc version dependent \_\_builtin\_constant\_p() usage
commit b0267507dfd0187fb7840a0ec461a510a7f041c5 upstream.
Commit 040a0a37 ("mutex: Add support for wound/wait style locks")
used "!\_\_builtin\_constant\_p(p == NULL)" but gcc 3.x cannot
handle such expression correctly, leading to boot failure when
built with CONFIG\_DEBUG\_MUTEXES=y.
Fix it by explicitly passing a bool which tells whether p != NULL
or not.
[ PeterZ: This is a sad patch, but provided it actually generates
similar code I suppose its the best we can do bar whole
sale deprecating gcc-3. ]

drm/i915: Fix the PPT fdi lane bifurcate state handling on ivb
commit 1fbc0d789d12fec313c91912fc11733fdfbab863 upstream.
Originally I've thought that this is leftover hw state dirt from the
BIOS. But after way too much helpless flailing around on my part I've
noticed that the actual bug is when we change the state of an already
active pipe.
For example when we change the fdi lines from 2 to 3 without switching
off outputs in-between we'll never see the crucial on->off transition
in the ->modeset\_global\_resources hook the current logic relies on.
Patch version 2 got this right by instead also checking whether the
pipe is indeed active. But that in turn broke things when pipes have
been turned off through dpms since the bifurcate enabling is done in
the ->crtc\_mode\_set callback.
To address this issues discussed with Ville in the patch review move
the setting of the bifurcate bit into the ->crtc\_enable hook. That way
we won't wreak havoc with this state when userspace puts all other
outputs into dpms off state. This also moves us forward with our
overall goal to unify the modeset and dpms on paths (which we need to
have to allow runtime pm in the dpms off state).
Unfortunately this requires us to move the bifurcate helpers around a
bit.
Also update the commit message, I've misanalyzed the bug rather badly.

The Intel D410PT(LW) and D425KT Mini-ITX desktop boards both show up as
having LVDS but the hardware is not populated. This patch adds them to
the list of such systems. Patch is against 3.11.4
v2: Patch revised to match the D425KT exactly as the D425KTW does have
LVDS. According to Intel's documentation, the D410PTL and D410PLTW
don't.

On CTG+ read out the pipe bpp setting from hardware and fill it into

drm: Pad drm\_mode\_get\_connector to 64-bit boundary
commit bc5bd37ce48c66e9192ad2e7231e9678880f6f8e upstream.
Pavel Roskin reported that DRM\_IOCTL\_MODE\_GETCONNECTOR was overwritting
the 4 bytes beyond the end of its structure with a 32-bit userspace
running on a 64-bit kernel. This is due to the padding gcc inserts as
the drm\_mode\_get\_connector struct includes a u64 and its size is not a
natural multiple of u64s.
64-bit kernel:
sizeof(drm\_mode\_get\_connector)=80, alignof=8
sizeof(drm\_mode\_get\_encoder)=20, alignof=4
sizeof(drm\_mode\_modeinfo)=68, alignof=4
32-bit userspace:
sizeof(drm\_mode\_get\_connector)=76, alignof=4
sizeof(drm\_mode\_get\_encoder)=20, alignof=4
sizeof(drm\_mode\_modeinfo)=68, alignof=4
Fortuituously we can insert explicit padding to the tail of our
structures without breaking ABI.

mm: Close races between THP migration and PMD numa clearing
commit 3f926ab945b60a5824369d21add7710622a2eac0 upstream.
THP migration uses the page lock to guard against parallel allocations
but there are cases like this still open
Task A Task B
--------------------- ---------------------
do\_huge\_pmd\_numa\_page do\_huge\_pmd\_numa\_page
lock\_page
mpol\_misplaced == -1
unlock\_page
goto clear\_pmdnuma
lock\_page
mpol\_misplaced == 2
migrate\_misplaced\_transhuge
pmd = pmd\_mknonnuma
set\_pmd\_at
During hours of testing, one crashed with weird errors and while I have
no direct evidence, I suspect something like the race above happened.
This patch extends the page lock to being held until the pmd\_numa is
cleared to prevent migration starting in parallel while the pmd\_numa is
being cleared. It also flushes the old pmd entry and orders pagetable
insertion before rmap insertion.

mm: numa: Sanitize task\_numa\_fault() callsites
commit c61109e34f60f6e85bb43c5a1cd51c0e3db40847 upstream.
There are three callers of task\_numa\_fault():
- do\_huge\_pmd\_numa\_page():
Accounts against the current node, not the node where the
page resides, unless we migrated, in which case it accounts
against the node we migrated to.
- do\_numa\_page():
Accounts against the current node, not the node where the
page resides, unless we migrated, in which case it accounts
against the node we migrated to.
- do\_pmd\_numa\_page():
Accounts not at all when the page isn't migrated, otherwise
accounts against the node we migrated towards.
This seems wrong to me; all three sites should have the same
sementaics, furthermore we should accounts against where the page
really is, we already know where the task is.
So modify all three sites to always account; we did after all receive
the fault; and always account to where the page is after migration,
regardless of success.
They all still differ on when they clear the PTE/PMD; ideally that
would get sorted too.

commit 587fe586f44a48f9691001ba6c45b86c8e4ba21f upstream.
THP migrations are serialised by the page lock but on its own that does
not prevent THP splits. If the page is split during THP migration then
the pmd\_same checks will prevent page table corruption but the unlock page
and other fix-ups potentially will cause corruption. This patch takes the
anon\_vma lock to prevent parallel splits during migration.

mm: Wait for THP migrations to complete during NUMA hinting faults
commit 42836f5f8baa33085f547098b74aa98991ee9216 upstream.
The locking for migrating THP is unusual. While normal page migration
prevents parallel accesses using a migration PTE, THP migration relies on
a combination of the page\_table\_lock, the page lock and the existance of
the NUMA hinting PTE to guarantee safety but there is a bug in the scheme.
If a THP page is currently being migrated and another thread traps a
fault on the same page it checks if the page is misplaced. If it is not,
then pmd\_numa is cleared. The problem is that it checks if the page is
misplaced without holding the page lock meaning that the racing thread
can be migrating the THP when the second thread clears the NUMA bit
and faults a stale page.
This patch checks if the page is potentially being migrated and stalls
using the lock\_page if it is potentially being migrated before checking
if the page is misplaced or not.

This fixes a regression for the Nomadik on the main system

The Nomadik seemed a bit slow and its heartbeat wasn't looking
healthy. And it was not strange, because it has been connected
to the 32768 Hz clock at boot, while being told by the clock driver
that it was 2.4MHz. Actually connect the TIMCLK to 2.4MHz by

lib/scatterlist.c: don't flush\_kernel\_dcache\_page on slab page
commit 3d77b50c5874b7e923be946ba793644f82336b75 upstream.
Commit b1adaf65ba03 ("[SCSI] block: add sg buffer copy helper
functions") introduces two sg buffer copy helpers, and calls
flush\_kernel\_dcache\_page() on pages in SG list after these pages are
written to.
Unfortunately, the commit may introduce a potential bug:
- Before sending some SCSI commands, kmalloc() buffer may be passed to
block layper, so flush\_kernel\_dcache\_page() can see a slab page
finally
- According to cachetlb.txt, flush\_kernel\_dcache\_page() is only called
on "a user page", which surely can't be a slab page.
- ARCH's implementation of flush\_kernel\_dcache\_page() may use page
mapping information to do optimization so page\_mapping() will see the
slab page, then VM\_BUG\_ON() is triggered.
Aaro Koskinen reported the bug on ARM/kirkwood when DEBUG\_VM is enabled,
and this patch fixes the bug by adding test of '!PageSlab(miter->page)'
before calling flush\_kernel\_dcache\_page().

xtensa: don't use alternate signal stack on threads

According to create\_thread(3): "The new thread does not inherit the creating
thread's alternate signal stack". Since commit f9a3879a (Fix sigaltstack
corruption among cloned threads), current->sas\_ss\_size is set to 0 for cloned
processes sharing VM with their parent. Don't use the (nonexistent) alternate

When a machine goes to S3/S4 after power-save is enabled, the runtime

This patch fixes the incorrect pm\_notify call simply by checking the

ALSA: hda - Add missing initial vmaster hook at build\_controls callback
commit b63eae0a6c84839275a4638a7baa391be965cd0e upstream.
The generic parser has a support of vmaster hook, but this is
initialized only in the init callback with the check of the presence
of the corresponding kctl. However, since kctl is NULL at the very
first init callback that is called before build\_controls callback, the
vmaster hook sync is skipped there. Eventually this leads to the
uninitialized state depending on the hook implementation.
This patch adds a simple workaround, just calling the sync function
explicitly at build\_controls callback.

ARC: Incorrect mm reference used in vmalloc fault handler
commit 9c41f4eeb9d51f3ece20428d35a3ea32cf3b5622 upstream.
A vmalloc fault needs to sync up PGD/PTE entry from init\_mm to current
task's "active\_mm". ARC vmalloc fault handler however was using mm.
A vmalloc fault for non user task context (actually pre-userland, from
init thread's open for /dev/console) caused the handler to deref NULL mm
(for mm->pgd)
The reasons it worked so far is amazing:
1. By default (!SMP), vmalloc fault handler uses a cached value of PGD.
In SMP that MMU register is repurposed hence need for mm pointer deref.
2. In pre-3.12 SMP kernel, the problem triggering vmalloc didn't exist in
pre-userland code path - it was introduced with commit 20bafb3d23d108bc

commit f6537f2f0eba4eba3354e48dbe3047db6d8b6254 upstream.
This patch uses CONFIG\_PAGE\_OFFSET to filter symbols which
are not in kernel address space because these symbols are
generally for generating code purpose and can't be run at
kernel mode, so we needn't keep them in /proc/kallsyms.
For example, on ARM there are some symbols which may be

symbols any more from /proc/kallsyms, this patch fixes the

parisc: Do not crash 64bit SMP kernels on machines with >= 4GB RAM
commit 54e181e073fc1415e41917d725ebdbd7de956455 upstream.
Since the beginning of the parisc-linux port, sometimes 64bit SMP kernels were
not able to bring up other CPUs than the monarch CPU and instead crashed the
kernel. The reason was unclear, esp. since it involved various machines (e.g.
J5600, J6750 and SuperDome). Testing showed, that those crashes didn't happened
when less than 4GB were installed, or if a 32bit Linux kernel was booted.
In the end, the fix for those SMP problems is trivial:
During the early phase of the initialization of the CPUs, including the monarch
CPU, the PDC\_PSW firmware function to enable WIDE (=64bit) mode is called.
It's documented that this firmware function may clobber various registers, and
one one of those possibly clobbered registers is %cr30 which holds the task
thread info pointer.
Now, if %cr30 would always have been clobbered, then this bug would have been
detected much earlier. But lots of testing finally showed, that - at least for
%cr30 - on some machines only the upper 32bits of the 64bit register suddenly
turned zero after the firmware call.
So, after finding the root cause, the explanation for the various crashes
became clear:
- On 32bit SMP Linux kernels all upper 32bit were zero, so we didn't faced this
problem.
- Monarch CPUs in 64bit mode always booted sucessfully, because the inital task
thread info pointer was below 4GB.
- Secondary CPUs booted sucessfully on machines with less than 4GB RAM because
the upper 32bit were zero anyay.
- Secondary CPus failed to boot if we had more than 4GB RAM and the task thread
info pointer was located above the 4GB boundary.
Finally, the patch to fix this problem is trivial by saving the %cr30 register
before the firmware call and restoring it afterwards.

clockevents: Sanitize ticks to nsec conversion
commit 97b9410643475d6557d2517c2aff9fd2221141a9 upstream.
Marc Kleine-Budde pointed out, that commit 77cc982 "clocksource: use
clockevents\_config\_and\_register() where possible" caused a regression
for some of the converted subarchs.
The reason is, that the clockevents core code converts the minimal
hardware tick delta to a nanosecond value for core internal
usage. This conversion is affected by integer math rounding loss, so
the backwards conversion to hardware ticks will likely result in a
value which is less than the configured hardware limitation. The
affected subarchs used their own workaround (SIGH!) which got lost in
the conversion.
The solution for the issue at hand is simple: adding evt->mult - 1 to
the shifted value before the integer divison in the core conversion
function takes care of it. But this only works for the case where for
the scaled math mult/shift pair "mult <= 1 << shift" is true. For the
case where "mult > 1 << shift" we can apply the rounding add only for
the minimum delta value to make sure that the backward conversion is
not less than the given hardware limit. For the upper bound we need to
omit the rounding add, because the backwards conversion is always
larger than the original latch value. That would violate the upper
bound of the hardware device.
Though looking closer at the details of that function reveals another
bogosity: The upper bounds check is broken as well. Checking for a
resulting "clc" value greater than KTIME\_MAX after the conversion is
pointless. The conversion does:
u64 clc = (latch << evt->shift) / evt->mult;
So there is no sanity check for (latch << evt->shift) exceeding the
64bit boundary. The latch argument is "unsigned long", so on a 64bit
arch the handed in argument could easily lead to an unnoticed shift
overflow. With the above rounding fix applied the calculation before
the divison is:
u64 clc = (latch << evt->shift) + evt->mult - 1;
So we need to make sure, that neither the shift nor the rounding add
is overflowing the u64 boundary.

issue and correct comment with the right math]

vhost/scsi: Fix incorrect usage of get\_user\_pages\_fast write parameter
commit 60a01f558af9c48b0bb31f303c479e32721add3f upstream.
This patch addresses a long-standing bug where the get\_user\_pages\_fast()
write parameter used for setting the underlying page table entry permission
bits was incorrectly set to write=1 for data\_direction=DMA\_TO\_DEVICE, and
passed into get\_user\_pages\_fast() via vhost\_scsi\_map\_iov\_to\_sgl().
However, this parameter is intended to signal WRITEs to pinned userspace
PTEs for the virtio-scsi DMA\_FROM\_DEVICE -> READ payload case, and \*not\*
for the virtio-scsi DMA\_TO\_DEVICE -> WRITE payload case.
This bug would manifest itself as random process segmentation faults on
KVM host after repeated vhost starts + stops and/or with lots of vhost
endpoints + LUNs.

target: Fix assignment of LUN in tracepoints
commit 2053a1db41193c2b5e1f47a91aaba0fd63ba7102 upstream.
The unpacked\_lun field in the SCSI target tracepoints should be
initialized with cmd->orig\_fe\_lun rather than cmd->se\_lun->unpacked\_lun
for two reasons:
- most importantly, if we are in the cmd\_complete tracepoint
returning a check condition due to no LUN found, cmd->se\_lun will
be NULL and we'll crash trying to dereference it.
- also, in any case, cmd->se\_lun->unpacked\_lun is an internal index
into the target's internal set of LUNs; cmd->orig\_fe\_lun is much
more useful and interesting, since it's the value the initiator
actually sent.

md: Allow devices to be re-added to a read-only array.
spares are activated on a read-only array. In case of raid1 and raid10
personalities it causes that not-in-sync devices are marked in-sync
without checking if recovery has been finished.
If a read-only array is degraded and one of its devices is not in-sync
(because the array has been only partially recovered) recovery will be skipped.
This patch adds checking if recovery has been finished before marking a device
in-sync for raid1 and raid10 personalities. In case of raid5 personality
such condition is already present (at raid5.c:6029).

When operate harddisk and hit errors, md\_set\_badblocks is called after
scsi\_restart\_operations which already disabled the irq. but md\_set\_badblocks
will call write\_sequnlock\_irq and enable irq. so softirq can preempt the
current thread and that may cause a deadlock. I think this situation should
use write\_sequnlock\_irqsave/irqrestore instead.

This bug was introduce in commit 2e8ac30312973dd20e68073653
(the first time rdev\_set\_badblock was call from interrupt context),
so this patch is appropriate for 3.5 and subsequent kernels.

Revert "select: use freezable blocking call"
commit 59612d187912750f416fbffe0c00bc0811c54ab5 upstream.
This reverts commit 9745cdb36da8 (select: use freezable blocking call)
that triggers problems during resume from suspend to RAM on Paul Bolle's
32-bit x86 machines. Paul says:
Ever since I tried running (release candidates of) v3.11 on the two
working i686s I still have lying around I ran into issues on resuming
from suspend. Reverting 9745cdb36da8 (select: use freezable blocking
call) resolves those issues.
Resuming from suspend on i686 on (release candidates of) v3.11 and
later triggers issues like:
traps: systemd[1] general protection ip:b738e490 sp:bf882fc0 error:0 in libc-2.16.so[b731c000+1b0000]
and
traps: rtkit-daemon[552] general protection ip:804d6e5 sp:b6cb32f0 error:0 in rtkit-daemon[8048000+d000]
Once I hit the systemd error I can only get out of the mess that the
system is at that point by power cycling it.
Since we are reverting another freezer-related change causing similar
problems to happen, this one should be reverted as well.

libata: make ata\_eh\_qc\_retry() bump scmd->allowed on bogus failures
commit f13e220161e738c2710b9904dcb3cf8bb0bcce61 upstream.
libata EH decrements scmd->retries when the command failed for reasons
unrelated to the command itself so that, for example, commands aborted
due to suspend / resume cycle don't get penalized; however,
decrementing scmd->retries isn't enough for ATA passthrough commands.
Without this fix, ATA passthrough commands are not resend to the
drive, and no error is signalled to the caller because:
- allowed retry count is 1
- ata\_eh\_qc\_complete fill the sense data, so result is valid
- sense data is filled with untouched ATA registers.

SCSI: sd: call blk\_pm\_runtime\_init before add\_disk
commit 10c580e4239df5c3344ca00322eca86ab2de880b upstream.
Sujit has found a race condition that would make q->nr\_pending
unbalanced, it occurs as Sujit explained:
"
sd\_probe\_async() ->
add\_disk() ->
disk\_add\_event() ->
schedule(disk\_events\_workfn)
sd\_revalidate\_disk()
blk\_pm\_runtime\_init()
return;
Let's say the disk\_events\_workfn() calls sd\_check\_events() which tries
to send test\_unit\_ready() and because of sd\_revalidate\_disk() trying to
send another commands the test\_unit\_ready() might be re-queued as the
tagged command queuing is disabled.
So the race condition is -
Thread 1 | Thread 2
sd\_revalidate\_disk() | sd\_check\_events()
...nr\_pending = 0 as q->dev = NULL| scsi\_queue\_insert()
blk\_runtime\_pm\_init() | blk\_pm\_requeue\_request() ->
| nr\_pending = -1 since
| q->dev != NULL
"
The problem is, the test\_unit\_ready request doesn't get counted the
first time it is queued, so the later decrement of q->nr\_pending in
blk\_pm\_requeue\_request makes it unbalanced.
Fix this by calling blk\_pm\_runtime\_init before add\_disk so that all
requests initiated there will all be counted.

can: flexcan: flexcan\_chip\_start: fix regression, mark one MB for TX and abort pending TX
commit d5a7b406c529e4595ce03dc8f6dcf7fa36f106fa upstream.
In patch
0d1862e can: flexcan: fix flexcan\_chip\_start() on imx6
the loop in flexcan\_chip\_start() that iterates over all mailboxes after the
soft reset of the CAN core was removed. This loop put all mailboxes (even the
ones marked as reserved 1...7) into EMPTY/INACTIVE mode. On mailboxes 8...63,
this aborts any pending TX messages.
After a cold boot there is random garbage in the mailboxes, which leads to
spontaneous transmit of CAN frames during first activation. Further if the
interface was disabled with a pending message (usually due to an error
condition on the CAN bus), this message is retransmitted after enabling the
interface again.
This patch fixes the regression by:
1) Limiting the maximum number of used mailboxes to 8, 0...7 are used by the RX
FIFO, 8 is used by TX.
2) Marking the TX mailbox as EMPTY/INACTIVE, so that any pending TX of that
mailbox is aborted.

Without this patch the mx28 is detected as the less specific p1010. This leads
to a p1010 specific workaround is activated on the mx28, which is not needed.

iwlwifi: mvm: call ieee80211\_scan\_completed when needed
commit 5a3e9f7f8c8768b5f7df81100c684e4cd00a6eb5 upstream.
When RFKill cuts short a scan, mac80211 cancels the scan.
This is done by sending a host command to the firmware, but
this command was dropped because of RFKill. Flag this
command as "SEND\_IN\_RFKILL" to make sure it is sent to the
firmware. The firmware will send SCAN\_COMPLETE\_NOTIFICATION
which will trigger a call to ieee80211\_scan\_completed.
If the scan cannot be aborted, it is because the firmware
already finished the scan but we hadn't notified mac80211
at the time mac80211 decided to cancel the scan. By the time
we see the scan could not be aborted, mac80211 has been
notified already.
This patch fixes situations in which we didn't notify
mac80211 upon completion of the scan that was cut short
by RFkill.

mwifiex: fix SDIO interrupt lost issue
commit 453b0c3f6910672f79da354077af728d92f95c5b upstream.
601216e "mwifiex: process RX packets in SDIO IRQ thread directly"
introduced a command timeout issue which can be reproduced easily on
an AM33xx platform using a test application written by Daniel Mack:
https://gist.github.com/zonque/6579314
mwifiex\_main\_process() is called from both the SDIO handler and
the workqueue. In case an interrupt occurs right after the
int\_status check, but before updating the mwifiex\_processing flag,
this interrupt gets lost, resulting in a command timeout and
consequently a card reset.
Let main\_proc\_lock protect both int\_status and mwifiex\_processing
flag. This fixes the interrupt lost issue.

commit 0c5b93290b2f3c7a376567c03ae8d385b0e99851 upstream.
When clients are idle for too long, hostapd sends nullfunc frames for
probing. When those are acked by the client, the idle time needs to be
updated.
To make this work (and to avoid unnecessary probing), update sta->last\_rx

mac80211: drop spoofed packets in ad-hoc mode
commit 6329b8d917adc077caa60c2447385554130853a3 upstream.
If an Ad-Hoc node receives packets with the Cell ID or its own MAC
address as source address, it hits a WARN\_ON in sta\_info\_insert\_check()
With many packets, this can massively spam the logs. One way that this
can easily happen is through having Cisco APs in the area with rouge AP
detection and countermeasures enabled.
Such Cisco APs will regularly send fake beacons, disassoc and deauth
packets that trigger these warnings.
To fix this issue, drop such spoofed packets early in the rx path.

mac80211: correctly close cancelled scans
commit a754055a1296fcbe6f32de3a5eaca6efb2fd1865 upstream.
\_\_ieee80211\_scan\_completed is called from a worker. This
means that the following flow is possible.
\* driver calls ieee80211\_scan\_completed
\* mac80211 cancels the scan (that is already complete)
\* \_\_ieee80211\_scan\_completed runs
When scan\_work will finally run, it will see that the scan
hasn't been aborted and might even trigger another scan on
another band. This leads to a situation where cfg80211's
scan is not done and no further scan can be issued.
Fix this by setting a new flag when a HW scan is being
cancelled so that no other scan will be triggered.

cgroup: fix to break the while loop in cgroup\_attach\_task() correctly
commit ea84753c98a7ac6b74e530b64c444a912b3835ca upstream.
Both Anjana and Eunki reported a stall in the while\_each\_thread loop
in cgroup\_attach\_task().
It's because, when we attach a single thread to a cgroup, if the cgroup
is exiting or is already in that cgroup, we won't break the loop.
If the task is already in the cgroup, the bug can lead to another thread
being attached to the cgroup unexpectedly:
# echo 5207 > tasks
# cat tasks
5207
# echo 5207 > tasks
# cat tasks
5207
5215
What's worse, if the task to be attached isn't the leader of the thread
group, we might never exit the loop, hence cpu stall. Thanks for Oleg's
analysis.
This bug was introduced by commit 081aa458c38ba576bdd4265fc807fa95b48b9e79
("cgroup: consolidate cgroup\_attach\_task() and cgroup\_attach\_proc()")

cifs: Fix inability to write files >2GB to SMB2/3 shares
commit 2f6c9479633780ba4a3484bba7eba5a721a5cf20 upstream.
When connecting to SMB2/3 shares, maximum file size is set to non-LFS maximum in superblock. This is due to cap\_large\_files bit being different for SMB1 and SMB2/3 (where it is just an internal flag that is not negotiated and the SMB1 one corresponds to multichannel capability, so maybe LFS works correctly if server sends 0x08 flag) while capabilities are checked always for the SMB1 bit in cifs\_read\_super().
The patch fixes this by checking for the correct bit according to the protocol version.

xhci: Don't enable/disable RWE on bus suspend/resume.
commit f217c980ca980e3a645b7485ea5eae9a747f4945 upstream.
The RWE bit of the USB 2.0 PORTPMSC register is supposed to enable
remote wakeup for devices in the lower power link state L1. It has
nothing to do with the device suspend remote wakeup from L2. The RWE
bit is designed to be set once (when USB 2.0 LPM is enabled for the
port) and cleared only when USB 2.0 LPM is disabled for the port.
The xHCI bus suspend method was setting the RWE bit erroneously, and the
bus resume method was clearing it. The xHCI 1.0 specification with
errata up to Aug 12, 2012 says in section 4.23.5.1.1.1 "Hardware
Controlled LPM":
"While Hardware USB2 LPM is enabled, software shall not modify the
HIRDBESL or RWE fields of the USB2 PORTPMSC register..."
If we have previously enabled USB 2.0 LPM for a device, that means when
the USB 2.0 bus is resumed, we violate the xHCI specification by
clearing RWE. It also means that after a bus resume, the host would
think remote wakeup is disabled from L1 for ports with USB 2.0 Link PM
enabled, which is not what we want.
This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, that
contain the commit 65580b4321eb36f16ae8b5987bfa1bb948fc5112 "xHCI: set
USB2 hardware LPM". That was the first kernel that supported USB 2.0
Link PM.

usb: musb: start musb on the udc side, too
commit 001dd84a92a25f8f2bad7d26df8bdb0362302c07 upstream.
I have am335x-evm with one port running in OTG mode. Since commit
fe4cb09 ("usb: musb: gadget: remove hcd initialization") the loaded
gadget does non pop up on the host. All I see is
|usb 4-5: new high-speed USB device number 52 using ehci-pci
|usb 4-5: device descriptor read/64, error -110
Since a later commit 2cc65fe ("usb: musb: add musb\_host\_setup() and
musb\_host\_cleanup()) the gadget shows up on the host again but only
in OTG mode (because we have the host init code running). It does not
work in device only mode.
If running in OTG mode and the gadget is removed and added back (rmmod
followed by modprobe of a gadget) then the same error is pops up on the
host side.
This patch ensures that the gadget side also executes musb\_start() which
puts the chip in "connect accept" mode. With this change the device
works in OTG & device mode and the gadget can be added & removed
multiple times.
A device (if musb is in OTG mode acting as a host) is only recognized if
it is attached during module load (musb\_hdrc module). After the device
unplugged and plugged again the host does not recognize it. We get a
buch of errors if musb running in OTG mode, attached to a host and no
gadget is loaded. Bah.
This is one step forward. Host & device only mode should work. I will
look at OTG later. I looked at this before commit fe4cb09 and OTG wasn't
working there perfectly so I am not sure that it is a regression :)

# USN-2108-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities

18 February 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

mpd reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

system calls in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7263](/security/CVE-2013-7263))

mpb reported an information leak in the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (l2tp)

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7264](/security/CVE-2013-7264))

mpb reported an information leak in the Phone Network protocol (phonet) in

the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7265](/security/CVE-2013-7265))

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area

Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7281](/security/CVE-2013-7281))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-361-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-361.74](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-361.74)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](/security/CVE-2013-4470))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine

(KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a

device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2013-4592](/security/CVE-2013-4592))

Catalin Marinas reported a flaw in the get\_user and put\_user API functions

in the Linux kernel on ARM platforms. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrator privileges. ([CVE-2013-6282](/security/CVE-2013-6282))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1442-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1442.61](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1442.61)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's dm snapshot facility. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information

or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](/security/CVE-2013-4299))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](/security/CVE-2013-4470))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine

(KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a

device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2013-4592](/security/CVE-2013-4592))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-58-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-58.88](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-58.88)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-58-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-58.88](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-58.88)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-58-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-58.88](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-58.88)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-58-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-58.88](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-58.88)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-58-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-58.88](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-58.88)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-58-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-58.88](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-58.88)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-58-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-58.88](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-58.88)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

mpd reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

system calls in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7263](/security/CVE-2013-7263))

mpb reported an information leak in the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (l2tp)

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7264](/security/CVE-2013-7264))

mpb reported an information leak in the Phone Network protocol (phonet) in

the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7265](/security/CVE-2013-7265))

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area

Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7281](/security/CVE-2013-7281))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-2076-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

3 January 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-237-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-237.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-237.53)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1035875#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-11-28 17:35:49 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the networking support(CONFIG_NET), is vulnerable to a memory leakage flaw. It occurs while doing the recvmsg(2), recvfrom(2), recvmmsg(2) socket calls.  A user/program could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.  Upstream fix: -------------  -> <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/?id=bceaa90240b6019ed73b49965eac7d167610be69>   -> <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/?id=85fbaa75037d0b6b786ff18658ddf0b4014ce2a4>   Original 'CVE-2013-6405' assigned to this issue has been rejected and the following 4 have been assigned for the same:     - [CVE-2013-7263](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7263) (net/ipv4/ping.c, net/ipv4/raw.c, net/ipv4/udp.c,                     net/ipv6/raw.c, and net/ipv6/udp.c),    - [CVE-2013-7264](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7264) (net/l2tp/l2tp_ip.c),    - [CVE-2013-7265](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7265) (net/phonet/datagram.c)    - [CVE-2013-7281](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7281) (net/ieee802154/dgram.c)  === Name: [CVE-2013-6405](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-6405)  ** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.

added a check on CAP_SYS_RAWIO to the ioctl.  The compat ioctls need the
check as well.

# USN-2071-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

3 January 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-45.68)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-45.68)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-45.68)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-45.68)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-45.68)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's UDP

Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](/security/CVE-2013-4470))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for the SystemBase Multi-2/PCI serial card. An unprivileged user

could obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-4516](/security/CVE-2013-4516))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-35-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.8.0-35.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.8.0-35.50)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Important: kernel-rt security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0100)

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite

implementation handled sending of certain UDP packets over sockets that
used the UDP\_CORK option when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) feature
was enabled on the output device. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4470, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the perf\_trace\_event\_perm() function in the

Linux kernel checked permissions for the function tracer functionality.
An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to enable function tracing
and cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2013-2930, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the net\_ctl\_permissions() function in the

Linux kernel checked access permissions. A local, unprivileged user could
potentially use this flaw to access certain files in /proc/sys/net
regardless of the underlying file system permissions. (CVE-2013-4270,
Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Adaptec RAID controller

(aacraid) checked permissions of compat IOCTLs. A local attacker could use
this flaw to bypass intended security restrictions. (CVE-2013-6383,
Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the get\_dumpable() function return value was

interpreted in the ptrace subsystem of the Linux kernel. When
'fs.suid\_dumpable' was set to 2, a local, unprivileged local user could
use this flaw to bypass intended ptrace restrictions and obtain
potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-2929, Low)

* An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in the Marvell 8xxx

Libertas WLAN (libertas) driver in the Linux kernel. A local user able to
write to a file that is provided by the libertas driver and located on the
debug file system (debugfs) could use this flaw to crash the system. Note:
The debugfs file system must be mounted locally to exploit this issue.
It is not mounted by default. (CVE-2013-6378, Low)

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IPv6

source address-based routing implementation. A local attacker who has the
CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could use this flaw to crash the system.
(CVE-2013-6431, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Hannes Frederic Sowa for reporting
CVE-2013-4470. The CVE-2013-4270 issue was discovered by Miroslav Vadkerti
of Red Hat.

This update also fixes multiple bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
kernel to version kernel-rt-3.8.13-rt27, correct these issues, and fix the
bugs noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes. The system must
be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Jason Wang discovered a bug in the network flow dissector in the Linux

kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2013-4348](/security/CVE-2013-4348))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-45-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-45.68~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-45.68~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Details

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event

subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](/security/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Jason Wang discovered a bug in the network flow dissector in the Linux

kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2013-4348](/security/CVE-2013-4348))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo

Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](/security/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the

CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](/security/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user

could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2013-4515](/security/CVE-2013-4515))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

driver for the SystemBase Multi-2/PCI serial card. An unprivileged user

could obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-4516](/security/CVE-2013-4516))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](/security/CVE-2013-6378))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.

A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](/security/CVE-2013-6763))

A race condition flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's ipc shared

memory implimentation. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecied other impacts.

([CVE-2013-7026](/security/CVE-2013-7026))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.11.0-15-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-15.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-15.23)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-15-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-15.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-15.23)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
