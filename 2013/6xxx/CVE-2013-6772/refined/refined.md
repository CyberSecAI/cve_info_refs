Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of enforcement of the `X-Frame-Options` header in Splunk Web. This header is designed to prevent a website from being embedded in a frame on another site (clickjacking), which can be used to trick users into clicking on things they didn't intend to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing `X-Frame-Options` header:**  The Splunk web UI did not include the `X-Frame-Options` header, which is a security mechanism that instructs browsers on whether to allow the page to be rendered in `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, or `<object>` tags.
- **Clickjacking vulnerability:** The absence of this header allows attackers to embed the Splunk web interface into a malicious site, making the user believe they are interacting with the legitimate Splunk interface when in reality they are not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could create a malicious website that frames the Splunk web UI.
- A user, thinking they are interacting with the legitimate interface, could be tricked into performing actions such as clicking buttons, links, or filling out forms on the attacker's website.
- The impact is described as "Low to Medium level severity" as it doesn't directly attack the Splunk server, but manipulates the Splunk web UI via a malicious site.
- This can lead to a misrepresentation of the Splunk Web UI and could potentially allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Clickjacking attack:** The attacker embeds the Splunk web UI within an iframe on their malicious website.
- **Malicious site:** An unsuspecting Splunk Web user visits the attacker-controlled website.
-  The attack vector is client-side, meaning an attacker needs to lure a victim into visiting a malicious website to be able to execute an attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious website.
- The attacker does not need to be positioned on the Splunk server network.
- The attacker needs to be able to lure a Splunk user to their malicious website.

**Mitigation:**
- Splunk addressed this issue by adding the `X-FRAME-OPTIONS` response header set to `SAMEORIGIN` to all pages served by Splunk.
- This prevents the Splunk web UI from being framed on different origins.
- The configuration is configurable in the `web.conf` file.
- Splunk recommends upgrading to the latest release and applying hardening standards.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability affects Splunk 5.0.3 and older versions.
- Splunk credited the Voltage security team for the responsible disclosure.
- CVSS v2 score is 5.0 (Base), CVSS v3.1 score is not mentioned, CVSS impact score is 2.9, CVSS exploitability score is 10.
