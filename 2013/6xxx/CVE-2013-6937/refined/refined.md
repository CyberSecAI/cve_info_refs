The provided content is an exploit for CVE-2013-6937.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in Watermark Master v2.2.23 when processing a specially crafted `.wstyle` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing an XML file. The vulnerability exists within the handling of the `<cols name="...">` tag. Specifically, the `name` attribute's value is copied to a buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running the Watermark Master application. In this case, the provided exploit executes `calc.exe`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious `.wstyle` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place the malicious `.wstyle` file in the application's style directory. Then they must convince a user to open the vulnerable application and apply the malicious style.
