Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6933

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `parseRTSPRequestString()` function within the Live555 library.
- This function incorrectly parses RTSP requests that begin with a space or tab character, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** A specially crafted RTSP request with a leading space or tab allows overwriting data on the stack.
- **Infinite loop**:  Due to the incorrect parsing of the RTSP command the program enters an infinite while loop which leads to overwriting the stack with attacker controlled data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** On Windows platforms, by overwriting the SEH chain on the stack, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** On all platforms, a malformed request can cause the application to crash, leading to a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Clients:**
    -   **Manual Connection:** Tricking users into connecting to a malicious RTSP server by entering the address in their media player.
    -   **.pls Files:** Using specially crafted .pls playlist files that contain malicious RTSP server addresses.
    -   **VLC Browser Plugin:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the VLC browser plugin by directing it to a malicious RTSP server via a website.
- **Servers:**
    - Exploiting Live555-based RTSP servers (including VLC) by sending malformed requests causing either a crash or RCE on windows.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target (either the client or server).
- **RTSP Request Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft RTSP requests.
- **Windows Specific RCE**: To achieve remote code execution on windows, specific knowledge of SEH overwriting is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Live555 versions before 2013.11.29.
- VLC versions before 2.1.2 are vulnerable.
