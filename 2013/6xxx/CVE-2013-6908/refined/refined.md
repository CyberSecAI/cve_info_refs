The provided content is related to CVE-2013-6908.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in Cybozu Garoon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is susceptible to XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser, potentially leading to malicious activities like session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited over the internet through network packets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to convince a user to take a standard action, such as clicking on a malicious link or viewing a file to trigger the exploit. The complexity of exploitation is considered high, since the user must be convinced to take an action, and they may become suspicious if it requires elevated privileges.
