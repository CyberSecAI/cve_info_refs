Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a backdoor implemented in the firmware of various D-Link routers. The router's internal web server accepts and processes HTTP requests containing the specific User-Agent string "xmlset_roodkcableoj28840ybtide" without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the router's password authentication mechanism by using the hardcoded User-Agent string.
- **Hardcoded String:** The presence of a hardcoded string for administrative access is a critical security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Administrative Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain complete administrative control over the affected router via its web management interface. This allows the attacker to change any settings, potentially leading to further compromise of the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests over the network.
- **User-Agent Manipulation:** Attackers need to include the specific User-Agent string in the HTTP header of their request to the router's web interface to bypass authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router, which could be over the Internet if remote management is enabled or from within the local network.
- **HTTP Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting HTTP requests with the required User-Agent string.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by security researcher Craig Heffner.
- The vulnerability affects D-Link, Planex and potentially Alpha Networks routers, likely due to the same OEM.
- D-Link routers have remote web configuration disabled by default but it may be enabled by ISPs.
- Affected D-Link routers include DIR-100, DIR-120, DI-624S, DI-524UP, DI-604S, DI-604UP, DI-604+, and TM-G5240.
- Planex routers BRL-04R, BRL-04UR and BRL-04CW are also affected.
- D-Link has released firmware updates to address the vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is separate from CVE-2013-6027, which is a stack overflow vulnerability in the management web server.
