## D-Link routers authenticate administrative access using specific User-Agent string

#### Vulnerability Note VU#248083

Original Release Date: 2013-10-17 | Last Revised: 2014-07-29

---

### Overview

Various D-Link routers allow administrative web actions if the HTTP request contains a specific User-Agent string. This backdoor allows an attacker to bypass password authentication and access the router's administrative web interface. Planex and Alpha Networks devices may also be affected.

### Description

| CVE-2013-6026:  According to security researcher Craig Heffner, the firmware for various D-Link routers contains a backdoor that allows unauthenticated remote users to bypass the routers' password authentication mechanism. A router's internal web server will accept and process any HTTP requests that contain the User-Agent string "xmlset\_roodkcableoj28840ybtide" without checking if the connecting host is authenticated.D-Link has confirmed that the affected D-Link routers disable web configuration from the WAN by default.According to D-Link, the following D-Link routers are affected:     + DIR-100 + DIR-120 + DI-624S + DI-524UP + DI-604S + DI-604UP + DI-604+ + TM-G5240  According to [the original vulnerability report](http://www.devttys0.com/2013/10/reverse-engineering-a-d-link-backdoor/), the following Planex routers are likely affected:    + BRL-04R + BRL-04UR + BRL-04CW  It appears that Alpha Networks may be the OEM for routers branded by D-Link and Planex (and probably other vendors). It is not clear where in the supply chain the backdoor was added, so routers from any of these vendors may be affected.CVE-2013-6027:A separate stack overflow vulnerability in the management web server has also been [reported](http://pastebin.com/vbiG42VD). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker can take any action as an administrator using the remote management web server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| D-Link is [maintaining a page](http://www.dlink.com/be/fr/support/security) to inform users of this issue and provide updates as patches are released. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Restrict access to the administrative web server by disabling remote management features or by blocking HTTP requests on the external WAN interface. The administrative web server may listen on ports 80/tcp or 8080/tcp.D-Link has confirmed that the affected D-Link routers disable web configuration from the WAN by default. There is some [evidence](http://blog.erratasec.com/2013/10/that-dlink-bug-masscan.html) that at least one ISP may have deployed vulnerable routers with the remote WAN management enabled. |

# Update on Router Security issue

###

**Security for your D-Link router**

Various media reports have recently been published relating to vulnerabilities in network routers, including D-Link devices. Security and performance is of the utmost importance to D-Link across all product lines. This is not just through the development process but also through regular firmware updates to comply with the current safety and quality standards.

We are proactively working with the sources of these reports as well as continuing to review across the complete product line to ensure that the vulnerabilities discovered are addressed.

We will continue to update this page to include the relevant product firmware updates addressing these concerns.

In the meantime, you can exercise the below cautions to avoid unwanted intrusion into your D-Link router.

**Unsolicited emails**

* If you receive unsolicited e-mails that relates to security vulnerabilities and prompt you to action, please ignore it. When you click on links in such e-mails, it could allow unauthorised persons to access your router. Neither D-Link nor its partners and resellers will send you unsolicited messages where you are asked to click or install something.
* Make sure that your wireless network is secure.
* Disable remote access to your router if it is not required (this is disabled by default).

**Security patch for your D-Link router**

These firmware updates address the security vulnerabilities in affected D-Link routers. D-Link will update this continually and we strongly recommend all users to install the relevant updates.

As there are different hardware revisions on our products, please check this on your device before downloading the correct corresponding firmware update.
