Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6369

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow in the `jbg_dec_in()` function within the `jbig.c` decoder of the JBIG-KIT library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `jbg_dec_in()` function attempts to read data into a stack buffer (`s->buffer`) that is only 20 bytes in size, while the code logic allows copying up to 1728 bytes into it.
- This occurs when processing Deterministic Prediction tables (DPON | DPPRIV) inside a JBIG image file, specifically within the `while` loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A specially crafted JBIG image file can cause a program linked against the vulnerable `libjbig` library to crash due to a stack buffer overflow.
- It also has the potential to lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker carefully crafts the overflow payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted JBIG image file to a program that utilizes the vulnerable `libjbig` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious JBIG image data to an application that parses it using the vulnerable JBIG-KIT library.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.
*   The issue was fixed in JBIG-KIT version 2.1.
*   The affected code snippet is within the `jbg_dec_in()` function of `jbig.c`:

```c
/* read in DPTABLE */
if (s->bie_len < 20 + 1728 &&
    (s->options & (JBG_DPON | JBG_DPPRIV | JBG_DPLAST)) ==
    (JBG_DPON | JBG_DPPRIV)) {
  assert(s->bie_len >= 20);
  while (s->bie_len < 20 + 1728 && *cnt < len)
    s->buffer[s->bie_len++ - 20] = data[(*cnt)++];
  if (s->bie_len < 20 + 1728)
    return JBG_EAGAIN;
  if (!s->dppriv || s->dppriv == jbg_dptable)
    s->dppriv = (char *) checked_malloc(1728, sizeof(char));
  jbg_dppriv2int(s->dppriv, s->buffer);
}
```
*   The `while` loop copies data into the `s->buffer`, which has a fixed size of 20 bytes, leading to the overflow when processing DPTABLE.
