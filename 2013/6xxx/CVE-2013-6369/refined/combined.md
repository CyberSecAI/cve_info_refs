How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

JBIG-KIT revision history
-------------------------
Changes in version 2.1 (2014-04-08)
This is a security-critical bug-fix release that remains API and ABI
backwards compatible to version 2.0. Users who process BIE data from
untrusted sources should upgrade.
- fixed a buffer-overflow vulnerability in the jbig.c decoder,
reported by Florian Weimer (Red Hat): CVE-2013-6369
- fixed ability of corrupted input data to force jbig85.c decoder
into an end-less loop
- fixed a bug in the processing of private deterministic-prediction
tables (DPPRIV=1) in jbig.c decoder
- fixed integer-type mismatches in printf arguments on 64-bit systems
- fuzz-testing script added
Changes in version 2.0 (2008-08-30)
Main new features of release 2.0:
- This release adds a separate lightweight "T.85" version of the
encoder and decoder library (jbig85.c, jbig85.h). This new T.85
library is optimized for embedded low-memory applications, such as
printers and fax machines. It implements only the subset of the
JBIG standard that is required by the ITU-T T.85 fax profile,
namely only a single bit plane (P = 1) and no differential layers
(DL = D = HITOLO = SEQ = ILEAVE = SMID = TPDON = DPON = DPON =
DPLAST = 0) and some other restrictions (MY = 0, MX < 128).
The T.85 library requires only three pixel rows of the
uncompressed image to reside in memory at any time. This 3-line
buffer has to be allocated by the calling application, therefore
the T.85 library will not call any heap management functions such
as malloc() or free() itself.
- There are also two new example applications pbmtojbg85 and
jbgtopbm85 included that provide command-line access to the new
T.85 library. (Note to distribution maintainers: there is probably
little point in adding pbmtojbg85 and jbgtopbm85 to precompiled
JBIG-KIT packages for workstation operating systems, as these two
programs do not really provide the end user much additional
functionality beyond what pbmtojbg and jbgtopbm already do, which
use the full library instead.)
Changes to the original full jbig.c library from version 1.6:
- the arithmetic codec routines are now located in a separate source
file (they are now used by both the full library jbig.c and the new
T.85 library jbig85.c, and might also be of use to other applications)
- arithmetic decoder behaviour slightly changed to enable the
lookahead needed to handle T.85-style NEWLEN after the final
stripe
- added encoder support for adding comment marker segment
- added encoder option for using SDRST marker instead of SDNORM
(only useful to make encoder able to generate a wider range
of test data)
- added pbmtojbg options -C and -r, which provide command-line
access to the previous two extensions
- slightly improved diagnostic output of jbgtopbm option -d
- non-English translations of error messages are now provided
in a separate PO file (e.g., for use with GNU gettext),
jbg\_strerror() no longer has a language attribute and the
JBG\_EN, JBG\_DE\_8859\_1, JBG\_DE\_UTF\_8 constants no longer exist
- jbg\_dec\_in() return values changed; the least significant bits of
the error codes now provide more information about what caused the
error, beyond what the more general error text messages returned by
jbg\_strerror() reveal
- pbmtojbg has a new option -f as a shortcut for all the options
needed to make the output comply to the basic ITU-T T.85 fax
profile
- jbg\_dec\_getwidth(), jbg\_dec\_getheight(), jbg\_dec\_getsize(), and
jbg\_dec\_getsize\_merged() return now an unsigned long value
(was: long), and return 0 (was: -1) if no image is available yet
- jbgtopbm now outputs image dimensions in header padded to 10
digits fixed width, for consistency with jbgtopbm85
to allow for later in-place update of height due to NEWLEN
- macro JBG\_LICENCE can be changed from the default value "GPL" to a
licence agreement reference code to if the library is used under a
commercial licence, to clarify under which exact licence the
library is used in a particular application
Changes in version 1.6 (2004-06-11)
- various small changes to reduce the risk of 32-bit unsigned
integer overflows when dealing with extremely large images
- robuster treatment of L0 = 0xffffffff
- minor API modification in jbg\_enc\_options(): parameter l0 changed
from type long to unsigned long; previous value now remains
unchanged when l0 == 0 (was: l0 < 0)
- lots of type casts added such that the C source code is now
also compilable as C++
Changes in version 1.5 (2003-06-11)
- fixed two minor memory leaks (special thanks to Davide Pizzolato
 for locating one of these)
- jbgtopbm does not attempt any more to parse multiple concatenated
BIEs (options -m must be used now to enable this feature explicitly),
in order to handle BIEs with data after the last expected SDE gracefully
- various extensions to improve support of JBIG fax applications
(ITU-T T.85 profile):
o support for maximum adaptive template pixel offset increased
to MX=127 in both encoder and decoder
o encoder now has a hook for producing BIEs with a NEWLEN marker
segment and VLENGTH=1, in order to assist in testing decoders
for T.85 conformance (see also new pbmtojbg option -Y)
o a new function jbg\_newlen() can be used to scan an
entire in-memory BIE for NEWLEN marker segments and update the
YD value in the BIE header, which can be applied to BIE data
before passing it to the decoder for T.85 compliance
(Background: the incremental design of the JBIG-KIT decoder
makes it infeasible to look ahead for NEWLEN marker segments
that occur after the SDE with the last image line, therefore
this second pass is necessary to handle the old-style fax
applications permitted by T.85 in which the low-RAM encoder
doesn't know the height of the image at the start of
transmission)
Changes in version 1.4 (2002-04-09)
- typo fixed in stripe number calculation, which caused encoder and
decoder to fail on certain image sizes (special thanks to Koen Denecker
 for locating this one)
Changes in version 1.3 (2002-03-23):
- bugs fixed in jbg\_split\_planes(), jbg\_dec\_merge\_planes() that
caused a failure for more than eight planes per pixel
- example converters now can handle PGM files with up to 32 bits
per pixel
Changes in version 1.2 (2000-04-08):
- bug in the decoder fixed, which caused the rest of the input file
to be skipped whenever a comment marker was encountered (special
thanks to Ben Rudiak-Gould  for
reporting this one)
Changes in version 1.1 (1999-11-16):
- serious bug in the encoder fixed, which for a very small
percentage of images has caused an unterminated linked list to be
created internally that could have been responsible for
segmentation violations or non-terminating encoders
(special thanks to Hisashi Saiga  for
tracking that one down)
- minor bug in the "jbgtopbm -d" diagnostic output fixed
Changes in version 1.0 (1998-04-11):
- two bugs fixed that caused the encoder and decoder to fail
under certain modes of operation with several bit planes
- added new functions jbg\_split\_planes(), jbg\_dec\_merge\_planes(),
and jbg\_dec\_getsize\_merged() for easy handling of grayscale
images
- added support for compressing grayscale PGM files to pbmtojbg
and jbgtopbm
- more changes to avoid paranoid compiler warnings
Changes in version 0.9 (1996-01-09):
- encoder won't break any more on input bitmap data with incorrect
zero padding
- pbmtojbg displays a warning if input file has incorrect zero
padding
- various minor improvements suggested by Stefan Willer
- many minor changes in order to avoid warnings from paranoid
compilers
Changes in version 0.8 (1995-09-20):
- namespace cleared up, all names externally visible from the library
start now with jbg\_ or JBG\_
- minor non-critical bug fixed which caused library to fail compatibility
test and showed up especially on DEC Alpha systems
- jbg\_dec\_gethight() is now called jbg\_dec\_getheight()
- filenames conform now to MS-DOS limits
- Bug in pbmtojbg fixed (handling of ASCII PBM files)
Changes in version 0.7 (1995-06-10):
- more problems on 16-bit int systems and on Macintosh systems fixed
(special thanks to Jean-Pierre Gachen )
- global Makefile
Changes in version 0.6 (1995-06-08):
- memory leak fixed
- should now also work on systems where int is only 16-bit large
- changes of the JBIG "Technical Corrigendum 1" included (special
thanks to Dr. Sebestyen from Siemens AG for sending me a copy
of the draft)
First release: version 0.5 (1995-05-28)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1032273#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-19 21:27:13 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer found a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in the libjbig library (part of jbigkit).  A specially-crafted image file read by libjbig could be used to cause a program linked to libjbig to crash or, potentially, to execute arbitrary code.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1032273#c2)  Florian Weimer    2013-11-20 09:25:01 UTC  ``` The problematic loop is the while loop in this snippet from libjbig/jbig.c:jbg_dec_in():    /* read in DPTABLE */   if (s->bie_len < 20 + 1728 &&        (s->options & (JBG_DPON | JBG_DPPRIV | JBG_DPLAST)) ==       (JBG_DPON | JBG_DPPRIV)) {     assert(s->bie_len >= 20);     while (s->bie_len < 20 + 1728 && *cnt < len)       s->buffer[s->bie_len++ - 20] = data[(*cnt)++];     if (s->bie_len < 20 + 1728)        return JBG_EAGAIN;     if (!s->dppriv || s->dppriv == jbg_dptable)       s->dppriv = (char *) checked_malloc(1728, sizeof(char));     jbg_dppriv2int(s->dppriv, s->buffer);   }  s->buffer has only 20 bytes, and the loop copies much more than that.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1032273#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-20 20:02:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 826828](attachment.cgi?id=826828&action=diff "upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=826828&action=edit "upstream patch") upstream patch  Patch supplied by upstream to correct the flaw.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1032273#c11)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-04-08 12:57:23 UTC  ``` Public via:  <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/jbigkit/CHANGES>  Upstream has released jbigkit-2.1.tar.gz to fix this issue: <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/jbigkit/>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1032273#c12)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-04-08 12:58:54 UTC  ```  Created jbigkit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1085362](show_bug.cgi?id=1085362 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-6369 jbigkit: stack-based buffer overflow flaw [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1032273#c13)  Fedora Update System    2014-04-15 15:55:53 UTC  ``` jbigkit-2.0-10.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.
