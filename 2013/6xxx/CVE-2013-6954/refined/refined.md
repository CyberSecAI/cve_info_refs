{
  "CVE-2013-6954": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check in libpng when processing PLTE chunks. Specifically, the `png_do_expand_palette()` function doesn't handle the case of a zero-length PLTE chunk or a NULL palette, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Null pointer dereference due to missing checks for zero-length PLTE chunks or NULL palettes.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (application crash) by providing a specially crafted PNG image with a zero-length PLTE chunk or NULL palette.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by processing a crafted PNG image file. This can occur in various scenarios, such as viewing an image in a web browser or an image viewer application, or processing the image using an application that uses the libpng library.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted PNG image to the target system. This could be done by hosting the image on a malicious website, or sending it through an email or messaging application."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "libpng versions 1.6.1 through 1.6.7 fail to reject colormapped images with empty palettes.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Null pointer dereference in png_do_expand_palette()",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Application crash, leading to denial of service. Potential for arbitrary code execution if exploitable in a given program.",
      "Attack vectors": "By crafting a PNG image with an empty palette and tricking a vulnerable application into processing it.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote. Attacker needs to send the malformed png file for the vulnerable application to process"
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from the `png_do_expand_palette` function not handling a zero-length PLTE chunk or a NULL palette, which leads to a null pointer dereference.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability exists in the png_do_expand_palette function related to insufficient checks for a PLTE chunk of zero bytes or a NULL palette.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation results in a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash).",
      "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit this by crafting a malicious PNG image with either a zero-length PLTE chunk or a NULL palette, which triggers the null pointer dereference when processed by a vulnerable application.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malformed PNG image to the target system. For example, this can be achieved by placing the image on a website or including it in an email attachment."
