| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-12-20 18:02:47 UTC  ``` libpng 1.6.8 was released [1] and notes the following fix:  Handle zero-length PLTE chunk or NULL palette with png_error() instead of png_chunk_report(), which by default issues a warning rather than an error, leading to later reading from a NULL pointer (png_ptr->palette) in png_do_expand_palette(). This is [CVE-2013-6954](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-6954) and VU#650142.  The git commit to fix is available [3].

Sidhpurwala    2014-04-10 08:21:40 UTC  ``` Analysis:  libgng-1.2: ===========  png_set_PLTE() is called with the values num_palette=0, Later at:  454    if (num_palette < 0 || num_palette > PNG_MAX_PALETTE_LENGTH)  checks the bounds of num_palette, there is no checking for num_palette=0 though.  Then memory is malloced for png_ptr->palette structure at:   477    png_ptr->palette = (png_colorp)png_calloc(png_ptr,  478       PNG_MAX_PALETTE_LENGTH * png_sizeof(png_color));  This mallocs 256 * 3 bytes of memory into png_ptr->palette structure, Later at:    479    png_memcpy(png_ptr->palette, palette, num_palette * png_sizeof(png_color));  Here zero bytes are copied into png_ptr->palette because num_palette = 0, so this memcpy looks like:  png_memcpy(png_ptr->palette, palette, 0)  So png_ptr->palette is filled with 256 * 3 zeros, (due to calloc)  Later when this structure is references in png_do_expand_palette(), the output is zero and there is no crash.   libpng 1.6: ===========  Here in png_set_PLTE() there is a check for num_palette = 0 at:   523    if ((num_palette > 0 && palette == NULL) ||  524       (num_palette == 0  525 #        ifdef PNG_MNG_FEATURES_SUPPORTED  526             && (png_ptr->mng_features_permitted & PNG_FLAG_MNG_EMPTY_PLTE) == 0  527 #        endif  528       ))  529    {  530       png_chunk_report(png_ptr, "Invalid palette", PNG_CHUNK_ERROR);  531       return;  532    }  So when num_palette is zero, a warning is printed and the function exits, However no memory is malloced for the  png_ptr->palette structure, and its pointing to zero.  Later when its referenced in png_do_expand_palette(), there is a null pointer deref and it crashes.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-17 09:30:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0413 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0413.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-17 09:33:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0412 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0412.html>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c27)  Stefan Cornelius    2014-04-17 10:27:23 UTC  ``` OpenJDK upstream commit: <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/rev/df3f9871ee6f>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-17 11:42:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0414 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0414.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-05-13 19:48:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0486 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0486.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-05-15 17:29:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0508 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0508.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c31)  Tomas Hoger    2014-06-09 09:07:33 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1106391](show_bug.cgi?id=1106391 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2014-2405 OpenJDK: libpng unhandled zero-length PLTE chunk or NULL palette (AWT, 8031352)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-06-10 13:12:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2014:0705 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0705.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-07-29 15:41:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.4   Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.5   Red Hat Satellite Server v 5.6  Via RHSA-2014:0982 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0982.html>   ``` |  |

At the time, it wasn't apparent that the issue also affects libpng 1.5.x (libpng SRPM in Mageia 3) and libpng 1.2.x (libpng12 SRPM in Mageia 3, Mageia 4, and Cauldron).  In fact, the upstream website indicated that only 1.6.1 through 1.6.7 were affected.

If using it in the future, check that it's still valid with urpmq --whatrequires-recursive name_of_the_lib, especially for libpng12_0 because more and more packages switch to a newer libpng.  For libpng12, usually we test by opening some png files with xv, which depends on lib(64)png12_0. gcompris uses it too, indirectly, so try it.  For libpng15_15, lots of packages depend on it, including lots of games and viewers. Example : check that warmux and smc work well. Check that firefox can open a png file (don't forget to restart it after installing the update).   We also need to test png transformations, so use graphicsmagick to perform some transformations. 1Testing procedure for graphicsmagick : [https://wiki.mageia.org/en/QA_procedure:GraphicsMagick](https://wiki.mageia.org/en/QA_procedure%3AGraphicsMagick) ```  ---   CC: (none) => stormiWhiteboard: MGA3TOO => MGA3TOO has\_procedure  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=12747#c2)  Colin Guthrie    2014-02-15 14:34:08 CET  ``` Used sam2p (which links against libpng12_0) to convert a png to a PDF on M4-64.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1060907#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-03 21:43:28 UTC  ``` Jakub Wilk reported in a Debian bug report [1] that the unpack200 program included in OpenJDK did not properly handle the logfile properly.  If the the log file was unable to be opened, it would create /tmp/unpack.log instead as the fallback, but do so in an insecure manner, as shown in unpack.cpp (the below is from OpenJDK 6):  4732 void unpacker::redirect_stdio() { ... 4757 #else 4758     sprintf(tmpdir,"/tmp"); 4759     sprintf(log_file_name, "/tmp/unpack.log"); 4760 #endif 4761     if ((errstrm = fopen(log_file_name, "a+")) != NULL) { 4762       log_file = errstrm_name = saveStr(log_file_name); 4763       return ; 4764     } 4765 4766     char *tname = tempnam(tmpdir,"#upkg"); 4767     sprintf(log_file_name, "%s", tname); 4768     if ((errstrm = fopen(log_file_name, "a+")) != NULL) { 4769       log_file = errstrm_name = saveStr(log_file_name); 4770       return ; 4771     }  The same exists in OpenJDK 7 and 8.  This could allow a malicious local attacker to conduct local attacks, such as symlink attacks, where a file could be overwritten if the user running unpack200 had write permissions.  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=737562>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1060907#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-08 00:58:19 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned [CVE-2014-1876](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1876) to this issue:  <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/08/1>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1060907#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-28 12:35:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1060907#c0)) > If the the log file was unable to be opened, it would create /tmp/unpack.log > instead as the fallback, but do so in an insecure manner  There are actually multiple fallbacks.  Following is tried when unpacking, proceeding to the next if the current one fails:  - open log file that was specified on the command line using -l / --log-file option - open /tmp/unpack.log - use tmpnam() to generate unique filename with the pattern /tmp/#upkgXXXXXX, this file is also opened insecurely - open /dev/null - use stderr for logging  This has a rather limited impact.  Issue can only be triggered when user runs unpack200 with -l / / --log-file option with argument being a file that can not be created by unpack200 (e.g. file in a directory that does not exist or is not writable to the user running it, or file that already exists and can not be overwritten).  This issue currently remains unfixed upstream (it still exists in jdk9 hg).  The easy fix is to remove fallback to /tmp/unpack.log.  Fallback to tmpnam() generated temporary file should either be removed too, or replaced by safer variant (e.g. using mkstemp()).  Issue exists in all currently supported versions of OpenJDK, Oracle/Sun JDK, and IBM JDK shipped as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1060907#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-04-15 20:38:03 UTC  ``` Fixed now in Oracle Java SE 5.0u75, 6u75, 7u55 and 8u5 via Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2014.

# Security Bulletin: InfoSphere Streams is possibly affected by vulnerabilities in the IBM® SDK, Java™ Technology Edition (CVE-2014-0453 and CVE-2014-0460)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The IBM® Developers Kit, Java™ Technology Edition that is shipped with InfoSphere Streams has security vulnerabilities two of which could potentially affect InfoSphere Streams. Other vulnerabilities could be exposed by the use of custom Java code in InfoSphere Streams applications. Customers are advised to evaluate the identified vulnerabilities along with their Java code and take appropriate action if these security exposures affect their systems.

## Vulnerability Details

IBM InfoSphere Streams bundles the IBM Developers Kit, Java Technology Edition (IBM Developer Kit, Java). The IBM Developer Kit, Java is based on the Oracle® Java Developer Kit(TM) for which Oracle has released the April 2014 critical patch updates (CPU). The April 2014 release contains security vulnerability fixes and the IBM Java SDK has been updated to incorporate those updates. See the Remediation/Fixes section below for information on upgrading your Streams installation(s) to protect against these vulnerabilities.

## Remediation/Fixes

Customers who are concerned about any of these vulnerabilities should apply the appropriate upgrade for their InfoSphere Streams installation as indicated below. Fix packs and patches are available on IBM Fix Central.

* **Version 3.2:** Apply upgrade to [3.2.1 or later](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Streams&release=3.2.1.0&platform=All&function=all&source=fc). If JAVA\_HOME is defined see the note at the end of this section.
* **Version 3.1**: Apply upgrade [3.1 fix pack 3 (3.1.0.3) or later](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Streams&release=3.1.0.2&platform=All&function=all&source=fc). If JAVA\_HOME is defined see the note at the end of this section.
* **Version 3.0:** Apply patch [3.0.0.0-Patch\_for\_IBM\_Java6\_SR16](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Streams&release=3.0.0.0&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=3.0.0.0-Patch_for_IBM_Java6_SR16&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc). If JAVA\_HOME is defined see the note at the end of this section.
* **Versions 1.0 and 2.0:** Upgrade to the latest version of InfoSphere Streams for which a Java fix has been released.
* For assistance performing an upgrade contact IBM Technical Support.
* Customers who cannot upgrade and need to secure their installation should open a PMR with IBM Technical Support and request assistance securing their InfoSphere Streams system against the vulnerabilities identified in the October 2013 Oracle Java CPU. IBM will assist in securing your installation against the Java vulnerabilities identified in your InfoSphere Steams applications.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If JAVA\_HOME is set ensure it points to the install location of the upgraded IBM Developer Kit, Java. Applications compiled with JAVA\_HOME set to a different location will need to be recompiled after JAVA\_HOME has been changed. For more information on compiling with JAVA\_HOME set see the *Notes* section on the page at this URL: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCRJU_3.2.1/com.ibm.swg.im.infosphere.streams.install-admin.doc/doc/ibminfospherestreams-install-prerequisites-java-supported-sdks.html?lang=en>

| **libpng** |
| --- |

**libpng** is the official PNG reference library. It supports almost
all PNG features, is extensible, and has been extensively tested for
over 29 years. The home site for development versions (i.e., may be

buggy or subject to change or include experimental features) is [https://libpng.sourceforge.io/](https://libpng.sourceforge.io/index.html), and
the place to go for questions about the library is the [**png-mng-implement**](pngmisc.html#lists) mailing list.

libpng is available as ANSI C (C89) source code and requires **zlib 1.0.4**
or later (**1.2.13** or later recommended for performance and security
reasons). The current public release, **libpng 1.6.45**, includes minor
fixes and improvements:

* Hardened calculations in chroma handling to prevent overflows, and relaxed a constraint in cHRM validation to accomodate the standard ACES AP1 set of color primaries. (Contributed by John Bowler)* Removed the ASM implementation of ARM Neon optimizations and updated the build accordingly. Only the remaining C implementation shall be used from now on, thus ensuring the support of the PAC/BTI security features on ARM64. (Contributed by Ross Burton and John Bowler)* Fixed the pickup of the PNG\_HARDWARE\_OPTIMIZATIONS option in the CMake build on FreeBSD/amd64. This is an important performance fix on this platform.* Applied various fixes and improvements to the CMake build. (Contributed by Eric Riff, Benjamin Buch and Erik Scholz)* Added fuzzing targets for the simplified read API. (Contributed by Mikhail Khachayants)* Fixed a build error involving pngtest.c under a custom config. This was a regression introduced in a code cleanup in libpng-1.6.43. (Contributed by Ben Wagner)* Fixed and improved the config files for AppVeyor CI and Travis CI.

| | **Portability Note** The libpng  1.6.x  series continues the evolution of the libpng API, finally **hiding the contents** of the venerable and hoary **png\_struct** and **png\_info** data structures inside **private (i.e., non-installed) header files**. Instead of direct struct-access, applications should be using the various png\_get\_xxx() and png\_set\_xxx() accessor functions, which have existed for almost as long as libpng itself. libpng 1.8.x is now under development and will eliminate some long-deprecated APIs and "features," potentially breaking compatibility with very old apps. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

The portability notice should not come as a particular surprise
to anyone who has added libpng support to an application this millenium; the
manual has warned of it since at least July 2000. (Specifically:
*"Starting with version 2.0.0, both structures are going to be hidden, and
the contents of the structures will only be accessible through the
png\_get/png\_set functions."* OK, so the version number was off a
bit...and the grammar, too, but who's counting?) Those whose apps depend on
the older API need not panic, however (for now); libpng 1.2.x continues to
get security fixes, as has 1.0.x for well over a decade. (Greg no longer
bothers to list either series here; enough's enough, folks. Update those
apps now!)

The 1.5.x and later series also include a new, more thorough test program
(pngvalid.c) and a new pnglibconf.h header file that
tracks what features were enabled or disabled when libpng was built. On
the other hand, they no longer internally include the zlib.h header
file, so applications that formerly depended on png.h to provide
that will now need to include it explicitly.
Complete differences relative to libpng 1.4.x
are detailed [here](src/libpng-1.4.x-to-1.5.x-summary.txt).

See the bottom of this page for warnings about

**security and crash bugs**
in versions up through **libpng 1.6.36**.

In addition to the main library sources,
all of the 1.2.x/1.4.x/1.5.x/1.6.x/1.7.x series include
the [rpng, rpng2 and wpng](book/sources.html) demo programs,
the pngminus demo program, a subset of Willem van Schaik's
[PngSuite test images](http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/),
and Willem's VisualPng demo program.

### Security and Crash Bugs in Older Versions

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.36 and earlier have a use-after-free bug in the simplified libpng API png\_image\_free(). It has been assigned ID [CVE-2019-7317](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7317). The vulnerability is fixed in version **1.6.37**, released on 15 April 2019. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng version 1.6.31 added png\_handle\_eXIf(), which has a null-pointer-dereference bug as well as a potential memory leak. Insofar as the function has existed for only four weeks and the chunk itself for only six, it's unlikely there are any applications affected by it at this time, but they might come into existence in the future. The vulnerability is fixed in version **1.6.32**, released on 24 August 2017. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.26, 1.5.27, 1.4.19, 1.2.56, and 1.0.66, respectively, have a null-pointer-dereference bug in png\_set\_text\_2() when an image-editing application adds, removes, and re-adds text chunks to a PNG image. (This bug does *not* affect pure viewers, nor are there any known editors that could trigger it without interactive user input. It has been assigned ID [CVE-2016-10087](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10087).) The vulnerability is fixed in versions **1.6.27**, **1.5.28**, **1.4.20**, **1.2.57**, and **1.0.67**, released on 29 December 2016. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all **old-branch** libpng versions through 1.5.25, 1.4.18, 1.2.55, and 1.0.65, respectively, have a potential out-of-bounds read in png\_check\_keyword(), which has been assigned ID [CVE-2015-8540](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8540)). The vulnerability is fixed in versions **1.5.26**, **1.4.19**, **1.2.56**, and **1.0.66**, released on 17 December 2015.  The current branch (1.6.x) is *not* vulnerable to this bug. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.19, 1.5.24, 1.4.17, 1.2.54, and 1.0.64, respectively, have a potential pointer overflow/underflow in png\_handle\_sPLT()/png\_handle\_pCAL() (and in png\_handle\_iTXt()/png\_handle\_zTXt() in the pre-1.6 branches), and all such versions likewise have a bug in their png\_set\_PLTE() implementations that left it open to the out-of-bounds write ([CVE-2015-8126](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8126)) that was supposed to have been fixed in the previous release. The bugs are fixed in versions **1.6.20**, **1.5.25**, **1.4.18**, **1.2.55**, and **1.0.65**, released on 3 December 2015. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.18, 1.5.23, 1.4.16, 1.2.53, and 1.0.63, respectively, have a potential out-of-bounds read in png\_set\_tIME()/png\_convert\_to\_rfc1123() and an out-of-bounds write in png\_get\_PLTE()/png\_set\_PLTE(). The former vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2015-7981](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7981) and the latter [CVE-2015-8126](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8126). The first is fixed in versions **1.6.19**, **1.5.24**, **1.4.17**, **1.2.54**, and **1.0.64**, released on 12 November 2015; see the subsequent vulnerability warning for info about the latter fix. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.9 through 1.6.15 (and some subset of versions up through 1.5.20) have an integer-overflow vulnerability in png\_combine\_row() when decoding very wide interlaced images, which can allow an attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of memory with arbitrary (attacker-controlled) data. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2014-9495](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9495) and is fixed in versions **1.6.16** and **1.5.21**, released on 21 December 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.14, 1.5.19, 1.4.13, 1.2.51, and 1.0.61, respectively, have an out-of-bounds memory access in png\_user\_version\_check(). It is unclear whether this could lead to an actual exploit. The bug is fixed in versions **1.6.15**, **1.5.20**, etc., released on 20 November 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.0 through 1.6.9 hang when reading images that have zero-length IDAT chunks with the progressive (streaming) reader; a malicious web site could use this bug to cause a (minor) denial of service. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2014-0333](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0333) and is fixed in version **1.6.10**, released 6 March 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.1 through 1.6.7 fail to reject colormapped images with empty palettes, leading to a null-pointer dereference (crash) in png\_do\_expand\_palette(). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2013-6954](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6954) and is fixed in version **1.6.8**, released 19 December 2013. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Various versions of libpng through 1.5.11, 1.4.11, 1.2.49, and 1.0.59, respectively, set the top-level archive-extraction directory's permissions to be world-writable as part of the distcheck Makefile target's operations (configure-generated Makefile only). This could allow a local attacker on the build host to silently replace the extracted libpng library with a malicious version, conceivably poisoning an official binary distribution of libpng (though the likelihood of this seems remote), but more generally allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the permissions of the user running make. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2012-3386](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3386) and is fixed in version **1.5.12** (and versions **1.4.12**, **1.2.50**, and **1.0.60**, respectively, on the older branches), released 10 July 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All "modern" versions of libpng through 1.5.9, 1.4.10, 1.2.48, and 1.0.58, respectively, fail to correctly handle malloc() failure for text chunks (in png\_set\_text\_2()), which can lead to memory corruption and the possibility of execution of hostile code. This **serious vulnerability** has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3048](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3048) and is fixed in version **1.5.10** (and versions **1.4.11**, **1.2.49**, and **1.0.59**, respectively, on the older branches), released 29 March 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 1.0.6 through 1.5.8, 1.4.8, 1.2.46, and 1.0.56, respectively, fail to correctly validate a heap allocation in png\_decompress\_chunk(), which can lead to a buffer-overrun and the possibility of execution of hostile code on 32-bit systems. This **serious vulnerability** has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3026](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3026) and is fixed in version **1.5.9** (and versions **1.4.9**, **1.2.47**, and **1.0.57**, respectively, on the older branches), released 18 February 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.4 through 1.5.7 contain a one-byte (stack) buffer-overrun bug in png\_formatted\_warning(), which could lead to crashes (denial of service) or, conceivably, execution of hostile code. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3464](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3464) and is fixed in version **1.5.8**, released 1 February 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.4 (only) introduced a divide-by-zero bug in png\_handle\_cHRM(), which could lead to crashes (denial of service) in applications that support color correction. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3328](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3328) ([CERT VU#477046](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/477046)) and is fixed in version **1.5.5**, released 22 September 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All released versions of libpng (from 1.0 onward) have a buffer overrun in the code that promotes palette images with transparency (1 channel) to grayscale+alpha images (2 channels), but only for applications that call png\_rgb\_to\_gray() and not png\_set\_expand(). (None are known.) An arbitrary amount of memory may be overwritten in this case, with arbitrary (attacker-controlled) data. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2690](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2690).  libpng 1.2.20 and later crashes in png\_default\_error() due to internal use of a NULL pointer instead of the empty string (""). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2691](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2691).  Many (most?) versions of libpng read uninitialized memory when handling empty sCAL chunks, and they handle malformed sCAL chunks (those lacking a delimiting NULL between the internal strings) incorrectly. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2692](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2692).  All of these issues are fixed in version **1.5.4** (as well as **1.4.8**, **1.2.45**, and **1.0.55** on the older branches), released 7 July 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.0 (only) introduced a bug in the RGB-to-grayscale transform code, which can lead to buffer overruns due to incorrect calculation of the number of bytes per pixel. (Since 1.5.0 was just released, no apps or OS distributions are believed to ship with it, so the risk should be minimal.) This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-0408](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0408) ([CERT VU#643140](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/643140)) and is fixed in version **1.5.1**, released 3 February 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Several versions of libpng through 1.4.2 (and through 1.2.43 in the older series) contain a bug whereby progressive applications such as web browsers (or the rpng2 demo app included in libpng) could receive an extra row of image data beyond the height reported in the header, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write to memory (depending on how the application is written) and the possibility of execution of an attacker's code with the privileges of the libpng user (including remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2010-1205](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1205) (via Mozilla). An additional memory-leak bug, involving images with malformed sCAL chunks, is also present; it could lead to an application crash (denial of service) when viewing such images. Both bugs are fixed in versions **1.4.3** and **1.2.44**, released 25 June 2010. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Jeff Phillips reported that several versions of libpng through 1.2.35 contain an uninitialized-memory-read bug that may have security implications. Specifically, 1-bit (2-color) interlaced images whose widths are not divisible by 8 may result in several uninitialized bits at the end of certain rows in certain interlace passes being returned to the user. An application that failed to mask these out-of-bounds pixels might display or process them, albeit presumably with benign results in most cases. This bug may be fixed in version **1.2.36**, released 7 May 2009, but the correct fix is in version **1.2.37**, released 4 June 2009. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 0.89c through 1.2.34 contain an uninitialized-data bug that can be triggered by a malicious user. Specifically, there are several instances in which a malloc'd array of pointers is then initialized by a secondary sequence of malloc() calls. If one of these calls fails, libpng's cleanup routine will attempt to free the entire array, including any uninitialized pointers, which could lead to execution of an attacker's code with the privileges of the libpng user (including remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2009-0040](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0040) and is fixed in version **1.2.35**, released 18 February 2009. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.2.30 and 1.2.31 of libpng can crash when reading images with multiple zTXt chunks; it is likely that this vulnerability could lead to a remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2008-3964](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3964) and is fixed in version **1.2.32**, released 18 September 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 1.0.6 through 1.2.26 have a bug when handling unknown (to libpng) chunks with zero data length. Applications that call either png\_set\_read\_user\_chunk\_fn() or png\_set\_keep\_unknown\_chunks(), when used with standard builds of libpng (i.e., built with either PNG\_READ\_UNKNOWN\_CHUNKS\_SUPPORTED or PNG\_READ\_USER\_CHUNKS\_SUPPORTED defined), can crash when attempting to free a non-existent data buffer for the unknown chunk. The **pngtest** sample application distributed with libpng, **pngcrush**, and certain versions of **ImageMagick** are known to be affected, but the bug is otherwise believed to be quite rare. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2008-1382](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1382) and is fixed in version **1.2.27**, released 28 April 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Crash Warning** Most versions of libpng up through 1.2.24 have a number of minor coding errors that could lead to crashes in exceptional cases. For example, if memory allocation fails while processing certain ancillary chunks, libpng could crash while attempting to write to the NULL pointer; or if the application author failed to set up the info\_ptr as required, some parts of libpng fail to check for NULL and could crash trying to read the pointer (though it's probable that the error would have caused libpng to terminate upstream of these parts). The bugs are fixed in version **1.2.25**, released 18 February 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Version 1.2.21 has a crash bug when reading the ICC-profile chunk, iCCP ([CVE-2007-5267](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5267)). This bug is fixed in version **1.2.22**, released 13 October 2007. | | --- | |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.2.20 and earlier have a number of potential crash-bugs due to out-of-bounds reads in certain chunk-handlers; MITRE has collectively assigned them the identifiers [CVE-2007-5266](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5266), [CVE-2007-5268](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5268) and [CVE-2007-5269](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5269). These bugs are fixed in version **1.2.21**, released 4 October 2007, but another crash bug (related to the ICC-profile chunk) remains to be fixed in version **1.2.22**. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions up through 1.2.16 (and 1.0.24) have an NULL-pointer-dereference vulnerability involving palette images with a malformed tRNS chunk (i.e., one with a bad CRC value). This bug can, at a minimum, cause crashes in browsers simply by visiting a page displaying such an image; reportedly it also crashes the Microsoft Windows display manager. CERT refers to it as [VU#684664](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/684664) and MITRE as [CVE-2007-2445](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2445). It's fixed in versions **libpng 1.2.18** and **libpng 1.0.26** (also **1.2.17** and **1.0.25**, which had a bug in their configure scripts), released 15 May 2007. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.0.6 through 1.2.12 and 1.0.20 have a bug in the decoder for the sPLT ("suggested palette") chunk; this can lead to crashes and, accordingly, a denial of service (e.g., crashing your browser when you visit a site displaying a specially crafted PNG). The bug is fixed in **libpng 1.2.13** and **libpng 1.0.21**, released 15 November 2006. MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-5793](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5793). The same releases also include fixes for a specific class of application error (NULL png\_ptr) and for a bug in the code that *writes* the iCCP ("ICC profile") chunk. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions up through 1.2.11 and 1.0.19 have a buffer-overrun vulnerability when a particular error message is triggered. The overrun is always by exactly two bytes ('k' and NULL) so it seems highly unlikely that it could be used for anything more nefarious than denial of service (e.g., crashing your browser when you visit a site displaying a specially crafted PNG). Nevertheless, it's worth fixing, and versions **libpng 1.2.12** and **libpng 1.0.20**, released 27 June 2006, do just that. (Note that 1.2.11 and 1.0.19 erroneously claimed to include the fix, but in fact it had been inadvertently omitted.) MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-3334](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3334). The same releases (and their immediate predecessors) also fix an out-of-bounds (by one) memory read and a second buffer overrun, this one in the code that *writes* the sCAL ("physical scale of subject") chunk (which is rather rare in any case). | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

There have been other issues in older versions released in 2004:

| | **Crash Warning** Versions 1.2.7, 1.2.6, 1.0.17, and 1.0.16 have a bug that will cause applications that strip the alpha channel (while reading a PNG) to crash. The bug is fixed in versions **1.2.8** and **1.0.18**, which were released on 3 December 2004. MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-0481](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0481). | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

The release before that fixed another bug, this one in the PNG-writing code:

| | **Broken-Image Warning** Versions 1.2.6 and 1.0.16 can write an invalid zlib header within the PNG datastream. This is not quite as bad as it sounds since the two-byte header can be corrected fairly easily (e.g., use [pngcrush](http://pmt.sf.net/pngcrush/) to rewrite the images and, perhaps, compress them slightly better, or run the *png-fix-IDAT-windowsize* utility bundled with [pngcheck](apps/pngcheck.html) 2.1.0 or later), but some applications will display the images incorrectly. Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer are known to be affected. A [libpng patch](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/libpng-1.2.6-patch-pngwutil.txt) is available, and versions **1.2.7** and **1.0.17** (incorporating the fix) were released on 11 September 2004. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

Finally--and most important--there were several security vulnerabilities
present in versions of libpng prior to 1.2.6 and 1.0.16, one of which is
**quite dangerous**:

| | **Vulnerability Warning** On 4 August 2004 a new **jumbo security patch** was released to address several potential vulnerabilities in libpng, at least one of which is *quite serious*. It was followed on 15 August by the full **libpng 1.2.6** and **libpng 1.0.16** releases, which, like subsequent releases, incorporate the fix. All users are strongly urged to upgrade to the latest release of libpng or to patch any affected applications as soon as possible. *(Graphical browsers and e-mail clients are particularly at risk.)* Get the latest releases or an appropriate combo patch either from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624) (headings [1.2.5-security-patches](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624&package_id=5683&release_id=257244) and [1.2.5and-older-sec-patchs](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624&package_id=5683&release_id=258110)) or from Oregon State's Open Source Lab.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 104 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1618213.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1618213.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 37 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 35 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
