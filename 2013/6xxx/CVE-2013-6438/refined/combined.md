### important: Apache HTTP Server weakness in mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches filesystem path. ([CVE-2024-38475](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38475))

Improper escaping of output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.

Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream memory not reclaimed right away on RST ([CVE-2023-45802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45802))

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### important: HTTP request splitting with mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy ([CVE-2023-25690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25690))

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution.

For example, something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

### important: NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request ([CVE-2021-31618](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31618))

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected mod\_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

Acknowledgements: Apache HTTP server would like to thank LI ZHI XIN from NSFoucs for reporting this.

### important: Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header ([CVE-2020-9490](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9490))

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

### low: Limited cross-site scripting in mod\_proxy error page ([CVE-2019-10092](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10092))

A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod\_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

### low: Out of bound write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values ([CVE-2017-15710](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15710))

mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

### moderate: Tampering of mod\_session data for CGI applications ([CVE-2018-1283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283))

When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.

### low: Possible out of bound access after failure in reading the HTTP request ([CVE-2018-1301](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1301))

A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.33, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.

When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.33 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerabilty hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod\_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now added to prevent such attacks.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### low: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION denial of service ([CVE-2016-8740](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8740))

The HTTP/2 protocol implementation (mod\_http2) had an incomplete handling of the LimitRequestFields directive. This allowed an attacker to inject unlimited request headers into the server, leading to eventual memory exhaustion.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### low: ap\_some\_auth\_required API unusable ([CVE-2015-3185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3185))

A design error in the "ap\_some\_auth\_required" function renders the API unusuable in httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap\_some\_authn\_required API added in 2.4.16 instead.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

URL in the request line. [Stefan Fritsch]
\*) core: New directive RegisterHttpMethod for registering non-standard
HTTP methods. [Stefan Fritsch]

[Kaspar Brand]
\*) http: Make ap\_die() robust against any HTTP error code and not modify
response status (finally logged) when nothing is to be done. PR 56035.
[Yann Ylavic]
\*) core, modules: Avoid error response/document handling by the core if some
handler or input filter already did it while reading the request (causing
a double response body). [Yann Ylavic]
\*) FreeBSD: Disable IPv4-mapped listening sockets by default for versions
5+ instead of just for FreeBSD 5. PR 53824. [Jeff Trawick,
Olli Hauer ]
\*) mod\_proxy: use the original (non absolute) form of the request-line's URI
for requests embedded in CONNECT payloads used to connect SSL backends via
a ProxyRemote forward-proxy. PR 55892. [Hendrik Harms , William Rowe, Yann Ylavic]

internationalization. [William Rowe]
\*) mod\_log\_config: Implement logging for sub second timestamps and
request end time. [Rainer Jung]
\*) mod\_log\_config: Ensure that time data is consistent if multiple
duration patterns are used in combination, e.g. %D and %{ms}T.
[Rainer Jung]
\*) mod\_log\_config: Add "%{UNIT}T" format to output request duration in
seconds, milliseconds or microseconds depending on UNIT ("s", "ms", "us").
[Ben Reser, Rainer Jung]
\*) In alignment with RFC 7525, the default recommended SSLCipherSuite
and SSLProxyCipherSuite now exclude RC4 as well as MD5. Also, the

PR 57100. [Michael Kaufmann ,
Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_ssl: Improve handling of ephemeral DH and ECDH keys by
allowing custom parameters to be configured via SSLCertificateFile,
and by adding standardized DH parameters for 1024/2048/3072/4096 bits.
Unless custom parameters are configured, the standardized parameters
are applied based on the certificate's RSA/DSA key size. [Kaspar Brand]
\*) mod\_ssl: drop support for export-grade ciphers with ephemeral RSA
keys, and unconditionally disable aNULL, eNULL and EXP ciphers
(not overridable via SSLCipherSuite). [Kaspar Brand]
\*) mod\_ssl: Add support for configuring persistent TLS session ticket
encryption/decryption keys (useful for clustered environments).
[Paul Querna, Kaspar Brand]

ap\_get\_server\_name\_for\_url() and use it where appropriate. This
fixes mod\_rewrite generating invalid URLs for redirects to IPv6
literal addresses. PR 52831 [Stefan Fritsch]
\*) dav\_validate\_request: avoid validating locks and ETags when there are
no If headers providing them on a resource we aren't modifying.
[Ben Reser]
\*) mod\_ssl: New directive SSLSessionTickets (On|Off).
The directive controls the use of TLS session tickets (RFC 5077),
default value is "On" (unchanged behavior).
Session ticket creation uses a random key created during web
server startup and recreated during restarts. No other key
recreation mechanism is available currently. Therefore using session
tickets without restarting the web server with an appropriate frequency
(e.g. daily) compromises perfect forward secrecy. [Rainer Jung]
\*) mod\_deflate: Define APR\_INT32\_MAX when it is missing so to be able to
compile against APR-1.2.x (minimum required version). [Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_reqtimeout: Don't let pipelining checks interfere with the timeouts
computed for subsequent requests. PR 56729. [Eric Covener]
Changes with Apache 2.2.29
\*) Corrected docs/manual pages for new MergeTrailers directive and other
out of date documentation. [William Rowe]
Changes with Apache 2.2.28 (not released)
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2014-0118 (cve.mitre.org)
mod\_deflate: The DEFLATE input filter (inflates request bodies) now
limits the length and compression ratio of inflated request bodies to avoid
denial of service via highly compressed bodies. See directives
DeflateInflateLimitRequestBody, DeflateInflateRatioLimit,
and DeflateInflateRatioBurst. [Yann Ylavic, Eric Covener]
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2014-0231 (cve.mitre.org)
mod\_cgid: Fix a denial of service against CGI scripts that do
not consume stdin that could lead to lingering HTTPD child processes
filling up the scoreboard and eventually hanging the server. By
default, the client I/O timeout (Timeout directive) now applies to
communication with scripts. The CGIDScriptTimeout directive can be
used to set a different timeout for communication with scripts.
[Rainer Jung, Eric Covener, Yann Ylavic]
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2014-0226 (cve.mitre.org)
Fix a race condition in scoreboard handling, which could lead to
a heap buffer overflow. [Joe Orton, Eric Covener, Jeff Trawick]
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2013-5704 (cve.mitre.org)
core: HTTP trailers could be used to replace HTTP headers
late during request processing, potentially undoing or
otherwise confusing modules that examined or modified
request headers earlier. Adds "MergeTrailers" directive to restore
legacy behavior. [Edward Lu, Yann Ylavic, Joe Orton, Eric Covener]
\*) core: Detect incomplete request and response bodies, log an error and
forward it to the underlying filters. PR 55475. [Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_deflate: Handle Zlib header and validation bytes received in multiple
chunks. PR 46146. [Yann Ylavic]

differs. PR 55782. [Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_deflate: Fix inflation of files larger than 4GB. PR 56062.
[Lukas Bezdicka ]
\*) mod\_dav: Fix improper encoding in PROPFIND responses. PR 56480.
[Ben Reser]
\*) mod\_ssl: Extend the scope of SSLSessionCacheTimeout to sessions
resumed by TLS session resumption (RFC 5077). [Rainer Jung]
\*) mod\_proxy\_ajp: Forward local IP address as a custom request attribute
like we already do for the remote port. [Rainer Jung]
\*) mod\_deflate: Don't fail when flushing inflated data to the user-agent
and that coincides with the end of stream ("Zlib error flushing inflate
buffer"). PR 56196. [Christoph Fausak ]
\*) mod\_cache, mod\_disk\_cache: With CacheLock enabled, responses with a Vary
header might not get the benefit of the thundering herd protection due to
an incorrect internal cache key. PR 50317.
[Ruediger Pluem, Jan Kaluza, Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_rewrite: Support session cookies with the CO= flag when later
parameters are used. The doc for this implied the feature had been
backported for quite some time. PR56014 [Eric Covener]
\*) mod\_cache: Don't remove stale cache entries that cannot be conditionally
revalidated. This prevents the thundering herd protection from serving
stale responses during a revalidation. PR 50317.
[Eric Covener, Jan Kaluza, Ruediger Pluem]
\*) core: Increase TCP\_DEFER\_ACCEPT socket option to from 1 to 30 seconds.
PR 41270. [Dean Gaudet ]
Changes with Apache 2.2.27
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2014-0098 (cve.mitre.org)
Clean up cookie logging with fewer redundant string parsing passes.
Log only cookies with a value assignment. Prevents segfaults when
logging truncated cookies.
[William Rowe, Ruediger Pluem, Jim Jagielski]
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2013-6438 (cve.mitre.org)
mod\_dav: Keep track of length of cdata properly when removing
leading spaces. Eliminates a potential denial of service from
specifically crafted DAV WRITE requests
[Amin Tora ]

hopefully saves some hours of searching for typos. PR 12863.
[AndrÃ© Malo]
\*) mod\_actions: Propagate the handler name to the action script via
the REDIRECT\_HANDLER environment variable. [AndrÃ© Malo]
\*) mod\_actions: Introduce the "virtual" modifier to the Action directive,
which allows the use of handlers for virtual locations. PR 8431.

[Philipp Reisner ]
\*) Fix some broken log messages in WinNT MPM.
[Juan Rivera ]
\*) prefork MPM: Use the right permissions for the directory created
for gprof support. [Jim Carlson ]
\*) Fix a compile failure with recent OpenSSL and picky compilers
(e.g., OpenSSL 0.9.7a and xlc\_r on AIX). [Jeff Trawick]
\*) OpenSSL headers should be included as "openssl/ssl.h", and not rely on
the INCLUDE path to be defined properly.
PR 11310. [Geoff Thorpe ]
\*) Modify APACHE\_CHECK\_SSL\_TOOLKIT to detect SSL-C. [Madhusudan Mathihalli]
\*) Replace the APACHE\_CHECK\_SSL\_TOOLKIT method with a cleaner one, using
autoconf tools (AC\_CHECK\_HEADER, AC\_CHECK\_LIB etc).
[Geoff Thorpe ]
\*) change directive name from 'compressionlevel' to 'deflatecompressionlevel'
[Ian Holsman, AndrÃ© Malo]

the current locale. level values are now really parsed as integers.
PR 17564. [AndrÃ© Malo]
\*) Extend mod\_negotiation to evaluate the environment variables
no-gzip and gzip-only-text/html the same way as mod\_deflate does.
[AndrÃ© Malo]

\*) Add mod\_dav\_lock - a generic subset of the DAV locking implementation.
[Justin Erenkrantz]
\*) Replace some of the mutex locking in the worker MPM with
atomic operations for higher concurrency. [Brian Pane]
\*) Allow 'make depend' to work with non-GCC compilers.
[Justin Erenkrantz]

apxs -i -a will add an un-commented AddModule directive for
the new module, which breaks the config.
PR: 11212 [Joe Orton]
\*) Fix mod\_proxy handling of filtered input bodies. [Justin Erenkrantz]
\*) Move the check of the Expect request header field after the hook
for ap\_post\_read\_request, since that is the only opportunity for
modules to handle Expect extensions. [Justin Erenkrantz]
\*) Rewrite of aaa modules to an authn/authz model.

```
Add ap_normalize_path() to replace ap_getparents() (with options).

include/httpd.h: Declare ap_normalize_path() and flags.
    AP_NORMALIZE_ALLOW_RELATIVE:
        Don't require that the path be absolute as per RFC 7230.
        This is needed for lookup subrequests.
    AP_NORMALIZE_NOT_ABOVE_ROOT:
        Check that directory traversal ("..") don't go above root, or
        initial directory with relative paths.
    AP_NORMALIZE_DECODE_UNRESERVED:
        Decode unreserved characters (like '.') first since they have
        the same semantics encoded and decoded.
    AP_NORMALIZE_MERGE_SLASHES:
        Merge multiple slahes into a single one.
    AP_NORMALIZE_DROP_PARAMETERS:
        Ignore path parameters (";foo=bar"). Not used by httpd but since
        ap_normalize_path() is taken from mod_jk's jk_servlet_normalize()
        it can allow them to use the upstream version now.

server/util.c: Implement ap_normalize_path().

modules/dav/main/util.c: Replace call to ap_getparents() using
    ap_normalize_path() with AP_NORMALIZE_DECODE_UNRESERVED flag since
    the path comes from an obsolute URL (thus potentially %-encoded).

modules/generators/mod_autoindex.c: Replace call to ap_getparents() using
    ap_normalize_path() with AP_NORMALIZE_ALLOW_RELATIVE and
    AP_NORMALIZE_NOT_ABOVE_ROOT flags to be consistent with original code.

include/ap_mmn.h: MINOR bump for ap_normalize_path().

RFC 4918 which says that the lock token is only required on resources
that may be modified by the method.

If a specially crafted request was sent, it is possible to crash mod_dav,
mod_cache or mod_session, as they accessed a field that is set to NULL
by the URI parser, assuming that it always put in a valid string.

  FINALLY Correct ap_http_method()!  It is NOT a method, it's a SCHEME!

  Bumped mmn, and ap module cookie, for this function rename.

  It's not a deprecation, as ap_http_method would be a lovely function
  name sometime in the future: to determine what the function name implies.

Give mod_dav the ability to output both standard and customized
<D:error> responses.  It's crucial for marshalling svn error messages
back over to the client; and someday it will be needed to return
specific <DAV:> errors as dictated by the DeltaV spec.

* mod_dav.h (dav_error): add two new fields -- an optional error
    namespace, and an error-tag-name.  Remove the 'delayed computation'
    function and cxt ptrs in this struct;  they were never used.

  (dav_new_error_tag):  new alternative constructor that takes new
    fields.

* util.c (dav_new_error_tag):  implement constructor.

* mod_dav.c (dav_error_response_tag):  new function to output
    'standard' xml error response based on error struct.

  (dav_handle_err): if no multistatus response is passed in, and if an
    error-tag is defined, then call our new xml-output routine.

Moved util_uri to apr-util/uri/apr_uri, which means adding the apr_
prefix to all of the uri functions (yuck), changing some includes,
and using APR error codes instead of HTTP-specific error codes.

Other notes to test this patch:
- You need to delete the util_uri.h file - exports picks up on this.
- I'd like to remove the apr_uri.h from httpd.h, but that might
  increase the complexity of this patch even further.  Once this patch
  is accepted (in some form), then I can focus on removing apr_uri.h
  from httpd.h entirely.  I need baby steps (heh) right now.
- I imagine that this might break a bunch of stuff in Win32 or other OS
  builds with foreign dependency files.  Any help here is appreciated.

This is a start...  -- justin

Revamp the CHECKOUT method handling and various support functions for it.
Basically, the original CHECKOUT was based on a really old draft of the
DeltaV specification. This brings it up to date.

*) get_resource hook now takes an optional label name and/or a flag on
   whether to use the DAV:checked-in property; if either one is provided,
   then a version resource is looked up and returned.

   WARNING: the parameter types are now the same, but have very different
	    semantics. this means you won't get a compile error to figure
	    out that something needs to be changed here.

*) mod_dav.c::dav_get_resource no longer cahces the fetched resource in the
   request userdata. Some requests will call this function multiple times,
   for different resources -- we don't want to keep returning the same
   resource (no idea how this ended up working).

*) dav_get_resource()'s parameters have been updated. target_allowed is old
   terminology; it is now label_allowed. The target paramter is obsoleted by
   the simple use_checked_in flag.

*) dav_get_target_selector() is obsolete. XML element processing is done
   within the CHECKOUT method (i.e. only where it occurs). The other half of
   the old function was to simply fetch the Label: header.

*) DAV_TARGET_SELECTOR_HDR is now DAV_LABEL_HDR

*) dav_method_checkout() now processes all the various options for a
   CHECKOUT method and either modifies the initial resource lookup, or
   passes the data to the checkout hook function.

*) the checkout hook grew a bunch of new parameters

*) new utility function: dav_xml_get_cdata() to gather up all the CDATA from
   an XML element. this is used to extract DAV:href values.
   (probably move to util_xml.c at some point)

Provide a way to allow get_resource and get_parent_resource to return errors
that might occur during the parsing of the URI and/or the lookup of the
resource in the repository.

Specifically: return a dav_error* and move the returned dav_resource* to an
"out" parameter of the hook function.

Apply a patch from John Vasta for adding (some/more) DeltaV support to
mod_dav. The patch applied and compiled cleanly, so I'm committing. Any
necessary changes from a review will come later, so that we can easily track
what needed to change (and can be back-ported to mod_dav 1.1).

forward-port John Vasta's checkin to mod_dav 1.1.x (on Sep 25, 2000). this
begins some work to upgrade the versioning support to some of the more
recent drafts.

- get_resource hook has new params
- create_collection hook no longer takes a pool
- new dav_auto_version_info structure to group up autoversion
  rollback/commit handling data
- new functions for getting workspace, target-selector, etc
- supportedlock hook now takes the resource in question (since different
  resources may have different locks)
- new resource types; tweaks in props.c to support them
- some tweaks with resource creation, Location header, etc.

   a. VMware vCSA cross-site scripting vulnerability

      VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a vulnerability
      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter.

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Please refer to  [WebSphere Application Server Security bulletin for CVE-2014-0098](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21667526) for remediation information.

**CVE ID:** [**CVE-2014-0963**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963) **(PI17025)

DESCRIPTION:** IBM HTTP Server is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM HTTP Server and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex.

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM HTTP Server instances, or monitor the mod\_mpmstats output written to the ErrorLog.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are generally cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 113 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

Please note that on April 18, 2014, Oracle released a [Security Alert for CVE-2014-0160 OpenSSL "Heartbleed"](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2014-0160.html). This Critical Patch Update includes an update to MySQL Enterprise Server 5.6 and this update includes a fix for vulnerability CVE-2014-0160. Customers of other Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the [fixes](/security-alerts/opensslheartbleedcve-2014-0160.html)  that were announced in the Security Alert for CVE-2014-0160.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1666884.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4150&id=1666884.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 20 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4170&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

**CVE ID:** [**CVE-2014-0963**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963) **(PI17025)

DESCRIPTION:** IBM HTTP Server is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM HTTP Server and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex.

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM HTTP Server instances, or monitor the mod\_mpmstats output written to the ErrorLog.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.
