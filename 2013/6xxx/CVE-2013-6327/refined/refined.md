- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-frame scripting vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious code within the context of the user's browser session, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the HTTP interface of the IBM Sterling Connect:Enterprise HTTP Option, which are then executed when a victim views the affected web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script code into the affected web application or website. No specific information about the attacker's position is provided in the document.
