Package        : strongswan
Vulnerability  : Denial of service and authorization bypass
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6075

A vulnerability has been found in the ASN.1 parser of strongSwan, an IKE
daemon used to establish IPsec protected links.

By sending a crafted ID_DER_ASN1_DN ID payload to a vulnerable pluto or
charon daemon, a malicious remote user can provoke a denial of service
(daemon crash) or an authorization bypass (impersonating a different
user, potentially acquiring VPN permissions she doesn't have).

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.4.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u2.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.0-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.0-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.

## strongSwan Denial-of-Service Vulnerability and Potential Authorization Bypass (CVE-2013-6075)

Nov 01, 2013

A DoS vulnerability and potential authorization bypass triggered by a crafted ID\_DER\_ASN1\_DN ID payload was discovered in strongSwan. All versions since 4.3.3 are affected.

[4.x](/blog/tags/4.x)[5.0.x](/blog/tags/5.0.x)[5.1.x](/blog/tags/5.1.x)[security fix](/blog/tags/security%2Bfix)

A crash report from one of our partners lead to the discovery of a DoS vulnerability and potential authorization bypass in strongSwan ([CVE-2013-6075](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2013-6075)). Affected are strongSwan versions 4.3.3 and newer, up to 5.1.0.

The bug can be triggered by a crafted *ID\_DER\_ASN1\_DN* ID payload and is caused by an insufficient length check when comparing such identities. There are two possible attack vectors targeting this vulnerability.

### DoS Attack

A crafted ID payload may be sent to cause memory reads outside the specified boundaries or a NULL dereference. As a result the IKE daemon might crash. As no write operation is performed, it is unlikely that injecting code is possible through this attack.

### Authorization Bypass

With a crafted ID payload, an attacker might impersonate a different user and get access to VPN connection profiles it wouldn't have to. This requires, however, that a user gets successfully authenticated with appropriate credentials. It seems quite difficult to construct such an attack, but we can't rule out the possibility at this time.

### Fix

The just released [strongSwan 5.1.1](/blog/2013/11/01/strongswan-5.1.1-released.html) fixes this vulnerability. For older releases we [provide a patch](http://download.strongswan.org/security/CVE-2013-6075/) that fixes the vulnerability in versions 4.3.3 and newer and should apply to all version.
