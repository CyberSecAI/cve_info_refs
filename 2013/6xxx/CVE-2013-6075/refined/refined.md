Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the ASN.1 parser of strongSwan, specifically within the `compare_dn` function in `identification.c`.
- An insufficient length check occurs when comparing Distinguished Names (DNs) within `ID_DER_ASN1_DN` ID payloads. This happens during a binary comparison of the DNs using `memeq`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Length Check:** The `memeq` function (later corrected to `chunk_equals`) was used without properly verifying if the length of the provided DNs matched before performing a byte-by-byte comparison.
- **Improper Handling of ASN.1 DNs:** The vulnerability arises from how the strongSwan IKE daemon handles ASN.1 DER encoded DNs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted `ID_DER_ASN1_DN` ID payload can cause the IKE daemon to crash due to memory reads outside of allocated boundaries or NULL dereference.
- **Authorization Bypass:** By sending a specially crafted `ID_DER_ASN1_DN` ID payload, an attacker might impersonate another user, potentially gaining unauthorized access to VPN connections. The attacker needs to successfully authenticate before this is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted `ID_DER_ASN1_DN` ID payload to a vulnerable strongSwan IKE daemon (pluto or charon). The vulnerable function is used when processing IKE packets, specifically the ID payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send IKE packets to the vulnerable strongSwan daemon. This likely means being on the network or having some means of communicating with the VPN server.
- For the authorization bypass, the attacker needs a valid credential to establish a connection, but they could potentially assume the identity of a different user through the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects strongSwan versions 4.3.3 up to 5.1.0
- The fix involves properly checking the length of the DN before performing the binary comparison.
- The provided patch replaces the `memeq` function with `chunk_equals` function, which includes the length comparison to prevent the out-of-bounds read.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `compare_dn` function
- The issue was discovered because of a crash report from a partner.
