Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6922

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the Seagate BlackArmor NAS device's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF:** The web interface does not implement sufficient checks to verify that requests originate from a legitimate user session. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that are executed by the victim's browser while the victim is logged into the NAS device's web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to perform various actions on the NAS device without the user's knowledge or consent, including:
*   Adding a new user with administrative privileges.
*   Performing a factory reset of the device.
*   Rebooting the device.
*   Adding, editing, or removing users.
*   Adding, editing, or removing shares and volumes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is performed by luring a logged-in user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious email.
*   The malicious site or email contains crafted HTML or JavaScript that sends forged requests to the NAS device's web interface while the victim is logged in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the NAS device or the victim's network.
*   The attacker needs to be able to induce the victim to visit a malicious webpage or open an email containing the exploit.
*   The attacker has to know the IP address or URL of the target NAS device.

**Additional Information:**
* The vendor, Seagate, was notified in September 2013 but stated that the issue would not be fixed.
* The vulnerable firmware version is sg2000-2000.1331.
*   This exploit is listed as "EDB Verified" meaning that Exploit-DB has verified the exploit is valid.
