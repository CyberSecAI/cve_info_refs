  {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2013-6796",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SMTP server performs authentication against LDAP by default, and it does not check if the password is null when using Base64 encoding for authentication. This allows an attacker to connect with a user account without providing a password.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication bypass due to lack of password validation when using Base64 and LDAP authentication.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication and send emails using any existing user account, including the 'admin' account, on the SMTP server.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker connects to the SMTP server via telnet or similar, uses 'auth login' command, then provides a username in Base64, followed by an empty password also in Base64. This bypasses the authentication check.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the SMTP server and knowledge of a valid username on the system.  The attacker doesn't need any pre-existing account or password. They can use telnet or any other client to connect to the SMTP server."
