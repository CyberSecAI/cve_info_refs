Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6462:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `bdfReadCharacters()` function within the `libXfont` library. This occurs when parsing Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF) font files.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by using `sscanf` without field width limits which may crash with huge input data. This means that if the "STARTCHAR" string in the BDF file is too long, it will overflow the `charName` buffer on the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a malicious local user to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the X.Org server (which often runs as root).
*   **Denial of Service:** Even without arbitrary code execution, the overflow can crash the X server, leading to denial of service. Some sources mention that default compiler options may reduce the vulnerability to just a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local User:** The vulnerability is typically exploited by a local user who has the ability to open or influence the loading of BDF font files by the X server or a client using `libXfont`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable X server is running.
*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Font File:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted malicious BDF font file to the affected application (X Server or any client using the vulnerable libXfont).

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability has been present since X11R5.
*   A patch has been developed which limits the input given to `sscanf`.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by using stack protection mechanisms which will cause the server to crash instead of allowing arbitrary code execution.
