Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from an incomplete fix for a previous bug (bug 55332, related to fullwidth characters). The initial fix introduced a flaw in the CSS sanitization process. Specifically, it allowed the insertion of escaped CSS values containing fullwidth backslashes (U+FF3C), which were later converted to normal backslashes *after* the escape sequences were processed. This bypassed the CSS validation checks and enabled the injection of potentially malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient CSS Sanitization:** The core weakness was that the CSS sanitizer failed to properly handle fullwidth backslashes, leading to the bypass of blacklists intended to prevent malicious CSS injection.
*   **Escaped CSS values:** The vulnerability was triggered due to how escaped CSS values were processed after the normalization of fullwidth characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting crafted CSS, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSS Injection:** The primary attack vector was through the injection of specially crafted CSS code. This was achieved by using fullwidth backslashes in the escape sequences of CSS values.
*   **User-Controlled Input:** The vulnerability was exploitable in contexts where users could control or influence the CSS code being rendered in the application (e.g., user profiles, content editors, etc.).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need the ability to inject CSS code into a MediaWiki instance. This could occur where user-supplied CSS input is not properly sanitized by the application.
*   The attacker does not need elevated privileges on the application to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided bug report (T60088) contains a concrete example of the vulnerability, showing how a `background-image: url()` property could be manipulated using a fullwidth backslash (`urï¼¼l(...)`) to bypass the CSS sanitizer and load an external image.
* The issue affected MediaWiki versions 1.19, 1.21 and 1.22
* Patches were created to address the issue, which included not normalizing the U+FF3C (Fullwidth Reverse Solidus) character, therefore preventing its use as an escape sequence bypass.
