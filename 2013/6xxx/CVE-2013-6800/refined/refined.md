{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The KDC, when serving multiple realms, could dereference a null pointer in the `setup_server_realm()` function if a request was made that did not properly initialize the server principal, leading to a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The KDC crashes, interrupting Kerberos authentication services.",
    "attack_vectors": "A network request to the KDC.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a specially crafted request to the KDC. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The content also mentions a related but less critical vulnerability involving a third-party KDC database module that can dereference a null pointer. This second vulnerability requires authentication to exploit."
