Multi-realm KDC null deref [[CVE-2013-1418](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gfmf-37px-c964 "CVE-2013-1418")]

```
If a KDC serves multiple realms, certain requests can cause
setup_server_realm() to dereference a null pointer, crashing the KDC.

CVSSv2: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C

A related but more minor vulnerability requires authentication to
exploit, and is only present if a third-party KDC database module can
dereference a null pointer under certain conditions.
