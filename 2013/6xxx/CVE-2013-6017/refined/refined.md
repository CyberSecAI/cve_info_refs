Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-6017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code within email bodies. This injected script is then stored and executed when other users view the email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML content, including malicious scripts, into the email body, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing authentication cookies.
    - Stealing other sensitive information.
    - Performing unauthorized actions within the web application, depending on the context of the user viewing the email.
    - The ability to inject malicious Javascript to perform further actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious email containing XSS payload within the email body.
- The attacker sends this email to a user of the vulnerable webmail server.
- When the victim views the email, the stored XSS payload executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to users of the vulnerable Atmail webmail server.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this XSS vulnerability.
