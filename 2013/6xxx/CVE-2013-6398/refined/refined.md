Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-6398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the Apache CloudStack virtual router handles firewall rules during a stop/start cycle. Specifically, the source restrictions (source CIDR) of firewall rules are not preserved when a virtual router is stopped and subsequently restarted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Firewall Rules:** Upon restarting, the virtual router fails to retain the configured source CIDR, effectively nullifying the source restriction of firewall rules.
*   **Default to Open Access:** When the source CIDR is lost, the firewall rule defaults to `0.0.0.0/0`, which opens up the allowed port to all traffic from the internet, rather than the intended restricted source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Increased Attack Surface:** By removing source restrictions from firewall rules, attackers can gain unauthorized access to services that were intended to be protected by these rules. For example, if a firewall rule was in place to allow SSH access (port 22) from a specific network (e.g., 172.16.40.0/24) only, the vulnerability would grant SSH access from any source on the internet.
*   **Potential for Lateral Movement:**  If an attacker gains unauthorized access through a service exposed due to this vulnerability, they could potentially use this access to move laterally within the affected network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Virtual Router Stop/Start:** The attack vector is triggered when a virtual router instance in Apache CloudStack is stopped and subsequently started. This is part of the standard upgrade procedure.
*   **Network Access:** An attacker would need network connectivity to the exposed ports on the vulnerable CloudStack instance after the virtual router has been restarted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges within the CloudStack environment to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered by normal operation of the system.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker requires network access to the affected services on the virtual router that have become exposed due to the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Exposed Service:** The attacker benefits from awareness of services exposed due to the missing source restrictions, such as SSH or other services protected by firewall rules.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Apache CloudStack versions 4.1.0, 4.1.1, and 4.2.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Fix Version:** This issue was fixed in Apache CloudStack version 4.2.1 and higher.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is considered a critical issue with a low risk level, primarily because it requires a restart of the virtual router to manifest.
