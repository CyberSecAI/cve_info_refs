{
  "Root cause": "A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability exists in the way PyWBEM performs certificate validation.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "TOCTOU vulnerability during certificate validation.",
    "The certificate validation is performed in a separate probing connection from the actual server interaction."
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can perform man-in-the-middle attacks against applications that are using PyWBEM.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the PyWBEM client and the server."
