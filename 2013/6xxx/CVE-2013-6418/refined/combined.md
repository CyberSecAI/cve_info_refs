# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1039801#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-10 02:42:18 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer discovered a TOCTOU (time of check to time of use) vulnerability in the way PyWBEM, a Python library for making CIM (Common Information Model) operations over HTTP using the WBEM CIM-XML protocol, performed certificate validation. An attacker could use this flaw to perform man-in-the-middle attacks against applications that are using PyWBEM.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1039801#c1)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-10 02:51:58 UTC  ``` In depth information from Florian:  I noticed this code in cim_http.py:       124             try:      125                 from OpenSSL import SSL      126                 ctx = SSL.Context(SSL.SSLv3_METHOD)      127                 ctx.set_verify(SSL.VERIFY_PEER, verify_callback)      128                 # Add the key and certificate to the session      129                 if cert_file is not None and key_file is not None:      130                   ctx.use_certificate_file(cert_file)      131                   ctx.use_privatekey_file(key_file)      132                 s = SSL.Connection(ctx, socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,      133 socket.SOCK_STREAM))      134                 s.connect((host, port))      135                 s.do_handshake()      136                 s.shutdown()      137                 s.close()      138             except socket.error, arg:      139                 raise Error("Socket error: %s" % (arg,))      140             except socket.sslerror, arg:      141                 raise Error("SSL error: %s" % (arg,))         151         h = HTTPSConnection(host, port = port, key_file = key_file,      152                                             cert_file = cert_file)  verify_callback is only used for the probing connection, it is not used for the actual server interaction.  This means pywbem has a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability and man-in-the-middle attacks on the second HTTPS connection are possible.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1039801#c3)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-19 02:29:13 UTC  ``` Public now via a Fedora build.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
