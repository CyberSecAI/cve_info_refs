# Jenkins Security Advisory 2013-11-20

This advisory announces multiple security vulnerabilities that were found in several Jenkins plugins.

## Description

### SECURITY-58 / CVE-2013-6372

[Subversion plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/subversion) was not storing credentials by using the security mechanism Jenkins core provides to plugins. As a result people with local system access on the Jenkins controller can compromise passwords and SSH private key passphrases Jenkins uses to access Subversion repositories. Jenkins project would like to thank Lennart Starr for finding this issue.

### SECURITY-53 / CVE-2013-6373

[Exclusion-plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/Exclusion) wasn’t protecting itself from unauthorized access to list and release resource locks that on-going builds have held. Jenkins project would like to thank mwebber for finding this issue.

### SECURITY-96 / CVE-2013-6374

[build failure analyzer](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-failure-analyzer) plugin had a [Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/), where an attacker with certain pre-existing privileges on Jenkins can execute JavaScript in the browser of other users. We thank Sharif Nassar for finding this problem.

## Severity

SECURITY-58 is rated **low** as it requires an attacker to have local access to the Jenkins controller. Subversion itself does not store passwords securely anyway.

SECURITY-53 is rated **medium**, as it allows anyone with access to Jenkins to mount an attack. However, the impact of the attack is limited, as it can only cause builds to fail and leads to no privilege escalation nor data loss.

SECURITY-96 is rated **low**. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be granted access to a certain permission explicitly.

## Fix

* Subversion plugin 1.54 contains the fix for SECURITY-58.
* Exclusion plugin 0.9 contains the fix for SECURITY-53.
* Build failure analyzer plugin 1.5.1 contains the fix for SECURITY-96.

Please update your plugins to receive fixes. All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Introduction

This plugin is inspired by the [Port Allocator](https://plugins.jenkins.io/port-allocator/) plugin.

The purpose of this plugin is to manage conflicts between jobs.

The Exclusion plugin allows you to assign resource names to jobs on Jenkins. The plugin will ensure that jobs sharing a same resource will not be executed at the same time. The resource name is a semaphore.

With the second part of the plugin you can, in an administration panel, see the list of resources configured in each job, see when a resource is allocated and, thanks to the release button, you can release a resource currently used.

## Configuration

Firstly you have to activate the plugin by checking the box "Add resource to manage exclusion". It allows you to add resources. A resource is represented by a name (String). You can add as many resources as needed.

Secondly you have to determine the critical zone, delimited by a start (Critical Block Start) and an end (Critical Block End). All build steps included in a critical zone will be managed by Exclusion plugin.

[![firstscreen](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/exclusion-plugin@master/docs/images/firstscreen.JPG)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/exclusion-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/firstscreen.JPG)

If you don’t add a start block the plugin won’t do anything. If you don’t add an end block, resources will be release after the last build step.

## Administration Panel

[![screen4](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/exclusion-plugin@master/docs/images/screen4.JPG)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/exclusion-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/screen4.JPG)

When you are on the home page of Jenkins, you can access the Administration Panel.

In this page, you can see all resources configured. The status (Action) of a job is set to "Currently Used" when the job is running (if he has a resource configured). It means that the resource is currently allocated → the other jobs using the same resource can’t be run at this moment.

You can release a resource by selecting a resource name in the combo box (that displays only the resources currently used) and clicking on "Release resource button".
