Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-6373:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Exclusion plugin did not properly protect against unauthorized access to list and release resource locks held by ongoing builds.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The plugin lacked proper access control mechanisms, allowing users with general access to Jenkins to interact with the resource locking mechanism, which is intended to manage conflicts between jobs.
- **Unauthorized Resource Manipulation:** The vulnerability allowed unauthorized users to list and release resource locks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Build Failures:** By releasing resource locks prematurely, an attacker could cause builds to fail, disrupting the normal operation of Jenkins.
- **Denial of Service:**  Repeatedly releasing resources can prevent jobs that rely on these resources from executing properly, causing a form of denial of service.
- **No Privilege Escalation or Data Loss:** The vulnerability did not allow for privilege escalation or data loss.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability was exploitable through the Jenkins web interface, specifically the administration panel of the Exclusion plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needed to have general access to the Jenkins instance, meaning they were authenticated users.

**Additional Details:**
The advisory indicates that this vulnerability was rated as **medium** severity because it could be exploited by anyone with access to Jenkins but the impact was limited to build failures, without any privilege escalation or data loss. The fix was released in version 0.9 of the Exclusion plugin.
