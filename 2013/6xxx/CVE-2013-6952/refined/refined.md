Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-6952:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Belkin WeMo firmware contains a hard-coded cryptographic key and password. This key is intended to be used for signing firmware updates, but its presence within the firmware image itself undermines the security of the update mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321):** The primary vulnerability is the storage of the firmware signing key directly within the firmware image. This is a critical flaw because it allows anyone with access to the firmware to extract the key.
*   **Misuse of GPG:** Belkin incorrectly implemented GPG asymmetric encryption, which requires a private key to remain secret to be effective, by embedding the signing key into the firmware. They should have used symmetric encryption with a signature and a shared public key ring to validate firmware updates.
*   **Lack of Entropy:** The devices generate less-than-random GUIDs due to a lack of entropy. Although not directly related to the firmware signing key, it is listed as a related vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Firmware Updates:** An attacker can extract the hard-coded key, sign malicious firmware, and distribute it to vulnerable WeMo devices.
*   **Complete Device Access:** By installing malicious firmware, an attacker can gain complete control over the affected WeMo device. This includes remote control of the attached devices, remote monitoring, and internal LAN access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Spoofing Firmware Updates:** Attackers can spoof the RSS feed used to deliver firmware update notices and push malicious firmware updates to WeMo users.
*   **Direct Firmware Access:** An attacker can extract the signing key by obtaining a copy of the firmware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Firmware:** The attacker needs access to a WeMo firmware image to extract the signing key.
*   **Ability to Spoof RSS Feed:** The attacker needs to be able to spoof the RSS feed used for firmware update notifications.
*   **Knowledge of WeMo Update Mechanism:** The attacker needs to understand the WeMo firmware update process.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically tied to the misuse of GPG and the inclusion of the signing key in the firmware.
*   The advisory also mentions a lack of entropy on the device as a related issue, leading to less-than-random GUIDs.
*   The vendor has released firmware updates to address this and other vulnerabilities.
