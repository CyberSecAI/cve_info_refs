Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure storage of sensitive data within cache files of the Subway Ordering for California (ZippyYum) 3.4 iOS mobile application. The application stored sensitive information in a SQLite database located in the application's cache directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Data Storage:** The application stores sensitive data, including user credentials and payment information, in a SQLite database (Cache.db and Cache.db-wal) located in the application's cache directory without encryption.
- **Clear-Text Storage:** The sensitive data is stored in clear-text, making it easily readable with tools capable of accessing SQLite databases.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** A malicious user with access to the device's file system can read sensitive data, including passwords, email addresses, delivery information, and complete payment card details (card number, security code, expiration date).
- **Identity Theft:** The exposed user information could be used for identity theft.
- **Financial Fraud:** The exposed payment card information could be used for financial fraud.
- **Account takeover:** The exposed password can be used to take over the user's account

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs physical access to the user's device or access to the device's file system via other means (e.g. malware).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Device Access:** The attacker must be able to access the device's file system. This could be achieved through physical access to the device, malware infection, or a jailbroken/rooted device where the file system is more accessible.
- **SQLite Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of working with SQLite databases to extract the data.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in version 3.4 of the Subway CA Kiosk iOS application.
- The sensitive data stored included: password, encryption key, customerPassword, customerEmail, delivery address details, paymentMethod, paymentCardType, paymentCardNumber, paymentSecurityCode, paymentExpMonth, paymentExpYear, paymentBillingCode, customerPhone, latitude/longitude, and email.
- A remediation notification was sent to the vendor on September 20, 2013, and the current version (3.7.1) has reduced the amount of clear-text sensitive information in the database.
