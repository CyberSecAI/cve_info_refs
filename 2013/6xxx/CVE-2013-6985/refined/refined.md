Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw present in the Enorth Webpublisher CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The primary weakness is an SQL Injection vulnerability, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, potentially including user credentials, by exploiting the injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/pub/m_worklog/log_searchday.jsp` endpoint. The `thisday` parameter is where the malicious SQL injection is inserted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the exploit is targeting a publicly accessible endpoint.
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses a time-based SQL injection by leveraging `UTL_INADDR.get_host_name`.
- The injection is demonstrated in the `thisday` parameter of the POST request.
- The exploit attempts to extract the `USER_NAME` and `PASS_WORD` from the `TN_USER` table, where `USER_ID` is equal to 1.
