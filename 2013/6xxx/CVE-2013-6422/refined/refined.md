Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the libcurl GnuTLS backend. When digital signature verification is disabled, the code mistakenly skips verifying the Common Name (CN) and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) fields in the TLS/SSL certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Hostname Verification:** The core issue is the lack of proper hostname verification when signature verification is disabled. This check is critical to ensure that the server the client is connecting to is indeed the server it intends to connect to.
- **Conditional Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is triggered only when digital signature verification is disabled in libcurl using the GnuTLS backend, which is not the default configuration. This means it's not a vulnerability that affects all installations, but only those specifically configured to not verify signatures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can perform a MitM attack. By presenting a fraudulent certificate, an attacker can intercept, view, or alter encrypted communications between the client and the server.
- **Exposed Sensitive Information:** Sensitive data being transmitted over the connection could be exposed to the attacker.
- **Altered Communications:** Attackers could modify data in transit, potentially leading to further compromises or data manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based:** The attacker must be positioned on the network path between the client and the server. This could be on a local network or on the internet, depending on the client's connection.
- **Fraudulent Certificate:** The attacker needs a fraudulent TLS/SSL certificate that matches the target server’s hostname to exploit the vulnerability when signature verification is disabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** Attacker needs network access to intercept the client’s traffic.
- **Malicious Certificate:** The attacker needs to create or obtain a fraudulent TLS/SSL certificate which will be accepted by the client because host name validation is skipped.
- **Specific libcurl configuration:** The client's libcurl instance must have digital signature verification disabled.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to the GnuTLS backend of libcurl.
- The default configuration of curl enables digital signature verification which makes it not vulnerable.
-  The fix involves ensuring that the host is still verified even when `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` isn't set.
-  The Debian Security Advisory DSA-2824-1 and Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2058-1 provide information about the vulnerability and its fixes in various versions of curl.
