How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# TYPO3-EXT-SA-2013-009: Several vulnerabilities in extension Apache Solr for TYPO3 (solr)

It has been discovered that the extension "Apache Solr for TYPO3" (solr) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting and Insecure Unserialize.

**Release Date:** September 25, 2013

**Bulletin Update:** November 06, 2014 (added CVEs)

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:** Version 2.8.2 and below

**Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting and Insecure Unserialize

**Severity:** Medium

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**CVE:** CVE-2013-6288 (Insecure unserialize), CVE-2013-6289 (Cross-Site Scripting)

**Problem Description:** Failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input the extension is open to Cross-Site Scripting and Insecure Unserialize.

**Solution:** An updated version 2.8.3 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at [http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/solr/2.8.3/](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/solr/2.8.3/ "Opens external link in new window"). Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.

**Credits:** Credits go to Gerrit Venema, Michel Tremblay and TYPO3 Security Team Member Georg Ringer who discovered the issues.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide/ "Initiates file download"). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce "Opens external link in new window") to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.
