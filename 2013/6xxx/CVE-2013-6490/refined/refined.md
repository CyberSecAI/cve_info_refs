{
  "CVE-2013-6490": {
    "Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the SIMPLE protocol header parsing within Pidgin. A malicious server can exploit this by providing a Content-Length header of '-1', leading to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability could cause Pidgin to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with the user's permissions.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect handling of the Content-Length header within SIMPLE protocol parsing, specifically when a value of '-1' is provided.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution on the affected system, using the privileges of the user running Pidgin.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. A malicious server can send a specially crafted SIMPLE message to a vulnerable Pidgin client. The malicious message would contain a Content-Length header set to '-1'.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a malformed SIMPLE message to a Pidgin client. This could be achieved by controlling a SIMPLE server or through a man-in-the-middle attack."
