Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-6881:

**Root Cause:**

*   The web application of the Ditto Forensic FieldStation is vulnerable to OS command injection due to improper neutralization of input fields. Specifically, parameters like 'sector size' or 'skip count' used in forensic imaging tasks are not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-77):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
*   **Full System Access:** Due to the web server running with root privileges, command injection leads to full system access, allowing the attacker to read and modify any data, install malware, and completely compromise the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Application Input Fields:**  Attackers can inject malicious commands through vulnerable input fields accessible via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Ditto Forensic FieldStation's web interface over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication
*   **Basic understanding of command injection**: Attacker needs knowledge of OS command injection techniques to craft malicious input.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in multiple input fields of the web application.
*   The webserver and PHP engine run as root, exacerbating the impact of the injection vulnerability.
*   Example exploit payloads include commands to exfiltrate the web application's source code or copy a PHP shell to the webserver's document root to maintain persistent access.
*  The device is marketed for use in potentially hostile networks of suspects which increases the risk of exploitation.

This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to completely compromise the Ditto Forensic FieldStation and potentially alter or destroy evidence data.
