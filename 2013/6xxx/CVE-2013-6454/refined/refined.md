Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of CSS attributes within MediaWiki. Specifically, the `-o-link` CSS attribute, which is specific to older versions of the Opera browser, was not being filtered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient CSS Sanitization:** The core issue is that MediaWiki's CSS sanitization mechanism failed to block the `-o-link` attribute, which allows for the execution of JavaScript.
*   **Use of Legacy Browser Feature:** The vulnerability relies on the `-o-link` property, a feature specific to older Opera browser versions (primarily Opera 12). While not widely used, its presence created an attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious CSS containing `-o-link` into a MediaWiki page. When a user viewed this page with a vulnerable version of Opera, the JavaScript associated with the `-o-link` attribute would be executed. This would allow the attacker to perform actions as the victim user, steal cookies, or redirect the user to a malicious page.
*   **User Interaction Required**: The exploit required the user to click the malicious element.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CSS Injection:** The primary vector is through the injection of malicious CSS code into the MediaWiki environment. This could be done where CSS is allowed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Inject CSS:** The attacker needs the capability to add or modify CSS code on a MediaWiki instance. This might be through editing a page directly or using other methods if allowed by the MediaWiki configuration.
*   **Target User Using Opera 12:** The attacker needs to target users who are using a vulnerable version of the Opera browser (specifically Opera 12, which is the version where -o-link was supported).

**Technical Details:**
The provided example illustrates how the `-o-link` attribute is used:
```html
<div title="&#100;&#97;&#116;&#97;&#58;&#116;&#101;&#120;&#116;&#47;&#104;&#116;&#109;&#108;&#44;&#60;&#105;&#109;&#103;&#32;&#115;&#114;&#99;&#61;&#49;&#32;&#111;&#110;&#101;&#114;&#114;&#111;&#114;&#61;&#97;&#108;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#40;&#49;&#41;&#62;" style="-o-link:attr(title);-o-link-source:current">Click Me</div>
```

This div tag has:
* A title attribute containing HTML which executes javascript when the image is loaded.
* a style using `-o-link:attr(title);`, this makes the browser interpret the contents of the `title` attribute as a link.
*`-o-link-source:current;` which makes the browser load the data in the title.
When a user clicks this element in opera, the javascript will be executed.

The fix is to blacklist the `-o-link` and `-o-replace` attributes in the CSS sanitization code.
