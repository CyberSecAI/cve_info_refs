# Digital Ocean API is not told to scrub (securely delete) VM on destroy #2525

## Description

[![@sneak](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408977?v=4&size=48)](/sneak)[sneak](https://github.com/sneak)opened [on Dec 30, 2013](https://github.com/fog/fog/issues/2525#issue-24872891)

Major security issue: the Digital Ocean API has a parameter on the destroy call to securely scrub the root blockdev on VM destroy, preventing future customers from reading the data left on disk by your VM.

This is surely a digitalocean security issue, but they're passing it on to users by making it a parameter - rather shitty of them. This is documented in their API at <https://cloud.digitalocean.com/api_access> - see "scrub\_data".

Fog does not pass this parameter, leaving Fog-destroyed VMs vulnerable to later customers stealing the data contained on them.

## Security Vulnerabilities

### [CVE-2013-6480] Libcloud doesnât send scrub\_data query parameter when destroying a DigitalOcean node

**Severity**: Low

**Affected Versions**: Apache Libcloud **0.12.3** to **0.13.3** (version prior
to 0.12.3 donât include a DigitalOcean driver)

**Description**:

DigitalOcean recently changed the default API behavior from scrub to non-scrub
when destroying a VM.

Libcloud doesnât explicitly send âscrub\_dataâ query parameter when destroying a
node. This means nodes which are destroyed using Libcloud are vulnerable to
later customers stealing data contained on them.

Note: Only users who are using DigitalOcean driver are affected by this issue.

References:

* <https://digitalocean.com/blog_posts/transparency-regarding-data-security>
* <https://github.com/fog/fog/issues/2525>

**Mitigation**:

This vulnerability has been fixed in version 0.13.3. Users who use DigitalOcean
driver are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this release.

### [CVE-2012-3446] Possible SSL MITM due to invalid regular expression used to validate the target server hostname

**Severity**: Medium

**Affected Versions**: Apache Libcloud 0.4.2 to 0.11.1 (version prior to 0.4.2
donât preform any target SSL certificate validation)

**Description**:

When establishing a secure (SSL / TLS) connection to a target server an
invalid regular expression has been used for performing the hostname
verification. Subset instead of the full target server hostname has been
marked as an acceptable match for the given hostname.

For example, certificate with a hostname field of `aexample.com` was considered
a valid certificate for domain `example.com`.

**Mitigation**:

This vulnerability has been fixed in version 0.11.1 so all the users should
upgrade to version 0.11.1 or higher.

**Credits**:

This issue was discovered by researchers from the University of Texas at Austin
(Martin Georgiev, Suman Jana and Vitaly Shmatikov).

### [CVE-2010-4340] SSL MITM vulnerability

**Severity**: Medium

**Affected versions**: All the versions prior to **0.4.2**

**Description**:

Python SSL library doesnât validate a host SSL certificate and as a
consequence, versions prior to **0.4.2** are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle
attack.

**Mitigation**:

This vulnerability has been fixed in the version 0.4.2. You are strongly
encouraged to upgrade to this version and set
`libcloud.security.VERIFY_SSL_CERT` variable to `True`.
