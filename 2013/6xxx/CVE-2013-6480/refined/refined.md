Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `python-apache-libcloud` library did not include the `scrub_data` parameter when making API calls to destroy DigitalOcean virtual machines. DigitalOcean's API has a parameter to securely scrub the root block device on VM deletion, preventing data leaks to future customers. The `scrub_data` parameter was not being used by `libcloud` when deleting a VM, as DigitalOcean's API was changed to default to non-scrub behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `python-apache-libcloud` library failed to use the `scrub_data` parameter in its calls to the DigitalOcean API when destroying virtual machines.
- The lack of this parameter means that the disk data from the destroyed VM was not securely deleted, creating a risk of data exposure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive data stored on the virtual machine's disk could be exposed to subsequent customers who are assigned the same underlying infrastructure resources.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would be a subsequent customer provisioned on the same hardware used by a previous victim.
- The attacker does not need to actively exploit the vulnerability, the data is simply left on disk by the standard operation of the software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a customer who has had a VM provisioned by DigitalOcean on a resource where a previous customer has not securely destroyed a VM using the vulnerable `python-apache-libcloud` library.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability only affects users utilizing the DigitalOcean driver within the `python-apache-libcloud` library.
- The issue has been fixed in version 0.13.3 of the library.
- DigitalOcean changed the default API behavior to not scrub data upon VM deletion; this exposed the vulnerability.
