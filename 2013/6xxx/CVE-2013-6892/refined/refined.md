Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- WebSVN, a web viewer for Subversion repositories, would follow symlinks within a repository when presenting a file for download. This means if a user added a symbolic link to a file outside of the repository, WebSVN would follow the link and give access to the linked file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-  **Symlink Following:** The primary vulnerability is the application's failure to properly handle symbolic links, leading to unintended file access.
-   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the path of the file being requested for download, specifically allowing a symlink to point to a resource outside of the intended repository.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker could gain access to any file on the server's file system that is readable by the user under which the web server runs. This could include sensitive system files, configuration files, or other user data.
-   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can download the content of the files, leading to information disclosure

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Repository Write Access:** The attacker must have write access to the Subversion repository.
-   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a symbolic link within the repository.
-   **Download Functionality:** The WebSVN download functionality must be enabled.
-   **Web Access:** The attacker has to access the file via the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Authenticated user with write access to a Subversion repository being viewed by WebSVN.
- Ability to commit changes including symbolic links.
- Knowledge of the webserver's file system to create a symlink pointing to a file they wish to access.
