Package        : websvn
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6892
Debian Bug     : 775682

James Clawson discovered that websvn, a web viewer for Subversion
repositories, would follow symlinks in a repository when presenting a
file for download. An attacker with repository write access could
thereby access any file on disk readable by the user the webserver
runs as.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1.1+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your websvn packages.

Hi,

James Clawson reported:

"Arbitrary files with a known path can be accessed in websvn by committing a
symlink to a repository and then downloading the file (using the download
link).

An attacker must have write access to the repo, and the download option must
have been enabled in the websvn config file.

Example:
- Create a symlink to /etc/passwd and commit it to the repo.
- Access websvn and download the file.
- The downloaded file will be the web server's /etc/passwd (i.e. the symlink is
  resolved on the web server).

This will also work with symlinks to directories, but dlmode=zip must be added
to the download link manually. Zip must be installed manually to be able to
download directories."

I've assigned [CVE-2013-6892](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6892) to this issue. Please mention it in the changelog
when fixing the issue.

I've created attached patch which solves the bug.

Cheers,
Thijs

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
