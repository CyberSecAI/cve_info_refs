## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-heat security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0090)

## Topic

Updated openstack-heat packages that fix two security issues, several bugs,
and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-heat packages provide heat, a Python implementation of the
OpenStack Orchestration engine, to launch multiple composite cloud
applications based on templates.

It was found that heat did not properly enforce cloudformation-compatible
API policy rules. An in-instance attacker could use the CreateStack or
UpdateStack methods to create or update a stack, resulting in a violation
of the API policy. Note that only setups using Orchestration's
cloudformation-compatible API were affected. (CVE-2013-6426)

A flaw was found in the way Orchestration's REST API implementation handled
modified request paths. An authenticated remote user could use this flaw to
bypass the tenant-scoping restriction by modifying the request path,
resulting in privilege escalation. Note that only setups using
Orchestration's cloudformation-compatible API were affected.
(CVE-2013-6428)

Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for
reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Steven Hardy of Red Hat as
the original reporter.

The openstack-heat packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2013.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. The most notable fixes and enhancements are:

* Auto-scaling has been fixed when AdjustmentType was set to

PercentChangeInCapacity.

* A QPID broker restart no longer permanently disrupts subscribed clients.
* RPC requests are now only serviced by one server in a given topic group.
* Auto-scaling group growth or shrinkage has been fixed to utilize the full

available size, regardless of the scaling policy adjustment.

(BZ#1045430)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The outdated heat-db-setup tool, which only supported local installs, has

been removed. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4
Installation and Configuration Guide has been updated to show how to create
the necessary database and associated tables for Orchestration, allowing
the deployment of the database server on a local or remote system (see
Installing the OpenStack Orchestration Service). (BZ#1046326)

* The heat-engine source code had a hard-coded reference to a Fedora image

name in the implementation of the AWS-compatible LoadBalancer resource.
This meant that you could not specify an alternative LoadBalancer image
name in deployments (for example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux). A new option
has been added to the Orchestration configuration file,
/etc/heat/heat.conf, which is named loadbalancer\_template. The new
loadbalancer\_template option can now be used to specify an alternate
LoadBalancer template that contains a different image name. (BZ#1048215)

* Due to a packaging error, the heat-manage tool was not working properly

(which prohibited a successful database creation). This error has been
fixed by moving the parallel package selection code so that all
Orchestration tools now use the proper packages for use at runtime.
(BZ#1048335)

All openstack-heat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

### Bug Description

I've discovered a problem with the way the Heat cloudformation-compatible API enforces the policy defined in policy.json.

We provide a default policy which looks like:

"deny\_stack\_user": "not role:heat\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:ListStacks": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:CreateStack": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:DescribeStacks": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:DeleteStack": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:UpdateStack": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:ValidateTemplate": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:GetTemplate": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:EstimateTemplateCost": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:DescribeStackResource": "",

    "cloudformation:DescribeStackResources": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:ListStackResources": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

The intention is that in-instance users are denied access to all API actions except DescribeStackResource, which is used by in-instance agents (e.g cfn-hup and os-collect-config I think) to poll for updated resource metadata.

The bug I've discovered means that the CreateStack and UpdateStack actions are not correctly enforcing the policy, so in theory the in-instance users might be able to create or update a stack, which they should not be allowed to do.

This affects templates using the following resources:

AWS::IAM::User, which is used when using AWS::IAM::AccessKey

AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle,

OS::Heat::HARestarter

AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy

I have a patch with a fix and associated tests demonstrating the issue.

Note that we currently don't have any policy enforcement on the native ReST API, which I'm also looking at fixing, but this seems particularly worrisome because we aren't enforcing the policy we advertise, whereas we don't provide any rules related to the native API yet (and in instance agents don't yet expect to connect to it) so hopefully it's clear that functionality is not yet implemented.

Does this affect Havana as well? If so we'll want a stable/havana bugtask and backport of the patch.

+2 for this patch.

A couple of points to help evaluate the security implications of this:

\* in-instance users are created by the use who originally created the stack

\* an in-instance user can only call CreateStack and UpdateStack if the ec2 keypair for that user is known

\* practically speaking, this can probably only be exploited if a stack-launched nova server is compromised, or if the heat->server communication containing the ec2 keypair is intercepted.

@Jeremy Stanley: Yes, this will affect Havana and Grizzly stable branches, I'll add them as targets above.

@Steve Baker: Yep, good points, my approach has been treating instances as implicitly untrusted (since there's no way to know if they are compromised or not). If you feel this is not serious enough to warrant srt process, we can just use the normal workflow, but I wanted to discuss in a private bug before assuming that would be appropriate.

I'll provide patches for Havana and Grizzly later today.

I confirm the need for an OSSA on this. Note that the OSSA would only cover Havana since Grizzly is not security-supported (pre-integration). That doesn't prevent the fix from being produced and applied to stable/grizzly though :)

+2 looks good to me.

It seems like there ought to be a tidier way to do the unit tests, but let's litigate that (or not) after the fix is in.

@Zane: by tidier, do you mean that there's lots of repetition? If so then I agree, it can probably be reworked to use testscenarios which would reduce the repeated stuff a lot. I'll add it to my todo list ;)

Kurt: Probably. We're still looking for further consensus (one more vote) from Heat core security reviewers on the proposed fixes and need to draft an impact description summarizing this issue, but will then submit a formal request for a CVE once we have those in place.

Title: CFN policy rules not all enforced

Reporter: Steven Hardy (Red Hat)

Products: Heat

Affects: All supported releases

Description:

Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Heat's default API policy enforcement. By calling the CreateStack or UpdateStack methods, an in-instance user may be able to create or update a stack in violation of the default policy. Only setups using Heat's cloudformation-compatible API are affected.

What can we do to progress this?

Releasing milestone builds with known serious vulnerabilities makes no sense to me :(

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

ERROR: No module named sqlalchemy ERROR 1146 (42S02) at line 1: Table 'heat.migrate_version' doesn't exist Final sanity check failed. Please file a bug report on bugzilla.redhat.com against the openstack-heat package.  at this stage, there are 3 candidates for python-sqlalchemy:  - version 0.7 from epel6 that is actually installed - version 0.5 from rpm-updates. If installed conflicts with 0.7. - version 0.8 from epel6 that cannot be installed due to priority problems.  --- Additional comment from Pádraig Brady on 2014-01-03 12:47:23 EST ---  So this is an issue with low level heat-manage command needed in this work around situation.

### Bug Description

I've discovered a problem with the way the Heat cloudformation-compatible API enforces the policy defined in policy.json.

We provide a default policy which looks like:

"deny\_stack\_user": "not role:heat\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:ListStacks": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:CreateStack": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:DescribeStacks": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:DeleteStack": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:UpdateStack": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:ValidateTemplate": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:GetTemplate": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:EstimateTemplateCost": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:DescribeStackResource": "",

    "cloudformation:DescribeStackResources": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

    "cloudformation:ListStackResources": "rule:deny\_stack\_user",

The intention is that in-instance users are denied access to all API actions except DescribeStackResource, which is used by in-instance agents (e.g cfn-hup and os-collect-config I think) to poll for updated resource metadata.

The bug I've discovered means that the CreateStack and UpdateStack actions are not correctly enforcing the policy, so in theory the in-instance users might be able to create or update a stack, which they should not be allowed to do.

This affects templates using the following resources:

AWS::IAM::User, which is used when using AWS::IAM::AccessKey

AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle,

OS::Heat::HARestarter

AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy

I have a patch with a fix and associated tests demonstrating the issue.

Note that we currently don't have any policy enforcement on the native ReST API, which I'm also looking at fixing, but this seems particularly worrisome because we aren't enforcing the policy we advertise, whereas we don't provide any rules related to the native API yet (and in instance agents don't yet expect to connect to it) so hopefully it's clear that functionality is not yet implemented.

+2 for this patch.

A couple of points to help evaluate the security implications of this:

\* in-instance users are created by the use who originally created the stack

\* an in-instance user can only call CreateStack and UpdateStack if the ec2 keypair for that user is known

\* practically speaking, this can probably only be exploited if a stack-launched nova server is compromised, or if the heat->server communication containing the ec2 keypair is intercepted.

@Jeremy Stanley: Yes, this will affect Havana and Grizzly stable branches, I'll add them as targets above.

@Steve Baker: Yep, good points, my approach has been treating instances as implicitly untrusted (since there's no way to know if they are compromised or not). If you feel this is not serious enough to warrant srt process, we can just use the normal workflow, but I wanted to discuss in a private bug before assuming that would be appropriate.

I'll provide patches for Havana and Grizzly later today.

I confirm the need for an OSSA on this. Note that the OSSA would only cover Havana since Grizzly is not security-supported (pre-integration). That doesn't prevent the fix from being produced and applied to stable/grizzly though :)

It seems like there ought to be a tidier way to do the unit tests, but let's litigate that (or not) after the fix is in.

@Zane: by tidier, do you mean that there's lots of repetition? If so then I agree, it can probably be reworked to use testscenarios which would reduce the repeated stuff a lot. I'll add it to my todo list ;)

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
