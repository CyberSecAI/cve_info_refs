Based on the content provided, here's an analysis related to CVE-2013-6357:

**Analysis:**

The provided content describes a potential CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) exploit that could be used to undeploy an application. While the CVE description is a placeholder, this content is potentially related as CSRF is a common web vulnerability.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper CSRF protection in the web application. This allows an attacker to induce an authenticated user's browser to make an unwanted request to the server.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the absence or insufficient implementation of CSRF tokens or other anti-CSRF mechanisms. This enables an attacker to craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will be executed by the server as if it came from the user.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to the unauthorized undeployment of an application. This could disrupt services and cause denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted malicious link, image, form, or script hosted on a website controlled by the attacker, or via email or other means. When a logged-in user visits this malicious resource, their browser automatically includes their session cookies which can be used to undeploy an application by a request to the vulnerable server.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting the malicious resource while the user still has an active, valid session with the target application. They also need knowledge of the target application's undeployment URL or API endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content doesn't offer specifics regarding the application's programming language, framework, or server.
* The provided content gives details of a CSRF attack in a general web application.

**Summary**

The provided information describes a CSRF vulnerability that could be used to undeploy an application. This vulnerability occurs due to a lack of CSRF protection. An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious resource. This is a common web vulnerability.
