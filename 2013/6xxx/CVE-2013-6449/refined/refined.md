```
  - **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in OpenSSL's TLS 1.2 implementation leads to the use of an incorrect hashing algorithm during the handshake process.
  - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from the way OpenSSL determines which hashing algorithm to use when the TLS 1.2 protocol is enabled.
  - **Impact of exploitation**: This could cause OpenSSL to use an incorrect hashing algorithm leading to an application crash.
  - **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker could trigger the flaw by initiating a TLS 1.2 connection.
  - **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TLS 1.2 connection with the vulnerable system.
