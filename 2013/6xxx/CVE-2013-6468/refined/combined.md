at <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/Red_Hat_JBoss_BPM_Suite/>

The following security issues are fixed with this release:

It was discovered that JBoss BPM Suite allowed remote authenticated users
to submit arbitrary Java code in MVFLEX Expression Language (MVEL) or JBoss
Rules expressions, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the
security context of the application server. Refer to the Solution section
for details on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2013-6468)

It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
attacks. If a remote attacker submitted a request containing an external
XML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing
the attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
(Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2011-5245, CVE-2012-0818)

It was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when
decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding
oracle. (CVE-2013-1624)

It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in
XML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker
able to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read
files accessible to the user running the application server and,
potentially, perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
(CVE-2014-0002)

The CVE-2014-0002 and CVE-2014-0003 issues were discovered by David Jorm of
the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the CVE-2013-6468 issue was
discovered by Marc Schoenefeld of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

Red Hat would like to thank Grégory Draperi for independently reporting
CVE-2013-6468.

All users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains download links (you must
log in to download the updates). Before applying the update, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update, and then after installing the
update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The fix for CVE-2013-6468 enables the Java Security Manager (JSM) to
sandbox the evaluation of MVEL expressions. This introduces performance
degradation in high load environments. The following ways of running Red
Hat JBoss BPM Suite are considered secure while mitigating performance
degradation:

1. In high load environments where performance is critical, it is
recommended to only deploy applications that have been developed on other
systems and properly reviewed. It is also recommended not to create any
users with the Analyst role on such systems. If these safeguards are
followed, it is safe to leave JSM disabled on these systems so it does not
introduce any performance degradation.

2. In testing and development environments without high loads, or in
environments where rule authoring is exposed to external networks, it is
recommended to have JSM enabled in order to achieve security benefits of
properly sandboxed evaluation of MVEL expressions.

Allowing users with the Analyst role to log in to the Business Central
console when JSM is disabled is not secure and not recommended.

# RHSA-2014:0372 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1, which fixes multiple security issues, various
bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat Customer
Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business rules management system for the
management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss Rules.

This release of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 serves as a replacement for Red
Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the
Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 Release Notes for information on the most
significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly
at <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BRMS/>

The following security issues are fixed with this release:

It was discovered that JBoss BRMS allowed remote authenticated users to
submit arbitrary Java code in MVFLEX Expression Language (MVEL) or JBoss
Rules expressions, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the
security context of the application server. Refer to the Solution section
for details on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2013-6468)

It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
attacks. If a remote attacker submitted a request containing an external
XML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing
the attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
(Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2011-5245, CVE-2012-0818)

It was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when
decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding
oracle. (CVE-2013-1624)

It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in
XML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker
able to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read
files accessible to the user running the application server and,
potentially, perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
(CVE-2014-0002)

The CVE-2014-0002 and CVE-2014-0003 issues were discovered by David Jorm of
the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the CVE-2013-6468 issue was
discovered by Marc Schoenefeld of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

Red Hat would like to thank Grégory Draperi for independently reporting
CVE-2013-6468.

All users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains download links (you must
log in to download the updates). Before applying the update, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update, and then after installing the
update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The fix for CVE-2013-6468 enables the Java Security Manager (JSM) to
sandbox the evaluation of MVEL expressions. This introduces performance
degradation in high load environments. The following ways of running Red
Hat JBoss BRMS are considered secure while mitigating performance
degradation:

1. In high load environments where performance is critical, it is
recommended to only deploy applications that have been developed on other
systems and properly reviewed. It is also recommended not to create any
users with the Analyst role on such systems. If these safeguards are
followed, it is safe to leave JSM disabled on these systems so it does not
introduce any performance degradation.

2. In testing and development environments without high loads, or in
environments where rule authoring is exposed to external networks, it is
recommended to have JSM enabled in order to achieve security benefits of
properly sandboxed evaluation of MVEL expressions.

Allowing users with the Analyst role to log in to the Business Central
console when JSM is disabled is not secure and not recommended.
