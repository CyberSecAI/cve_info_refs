{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability of Drools to evaluate arbitrary Java code within MVEL or Drools expressions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote code execution vulnerability due to insecure handling of MVEL and Drools expressions."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker with the ability to submit malicious code via MVEL or Drools expressions can achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the application server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation requires an authenticated remote user capable of submitting malicious code."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the capability to insert or manipulate MVEL or Drools expressions."
  },
   "affected_products": [
        "Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite",
        "Red Hat JBoss BRMS"
    ],
  "additional_notes": "The fix involves enabling Java Security Manager to sandbox the evaluation of MVEL expressions, which might introduce performance degradation in high load environments. Workarounds include disabling the JSM in secure environments where code review and controls are in place."
