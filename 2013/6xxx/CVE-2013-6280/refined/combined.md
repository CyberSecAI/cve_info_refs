### [Sets traking cookies](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sets-traking-cookies/)

I don’t remeber when I chose this plugin, but I was looking for for one with no third pard cookies, because of the silly EU cookie law (and the worst italian implementation). After a couple a year, I discover it is seeding a tracking cookie form some too curoius 3rd party (scorecardresearch.com). Sure I updated, and one update put me this surprise. So, thank you, I do not need it
non ricordo quando, ma lo scelsi perché non installava cookie (così mi sembrava). dopo un po’ faccio una verifica generale e… installa cookie, per di più traccianti di una terza parte invasiva(scorecardresearch.com)! L’avrò aggiornato, certamente. comunque grazie, non mi serve così.

It’s not working in IE, it just opens the plugin creator page.

Linksalpha slows down the load time of my site dramatically. It is a terrible performance drain. I have no choice but to remove this plugin.

Adds nasty adware to your site.

### [Injects ads, breaks JavaScript](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/injects-ads-breaks-javascript/)

Went to troubleshoot some JavaScript issues on a client’s website, and found this plugin as the culprit. Not only does it attempt to inject ads into the site, but it also was triggering numerous JavaScript errors in other plugins.
