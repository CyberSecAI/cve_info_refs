  "CVE-2013-6233": {
    "description": "SpagoBI contains a flaw that allows persistent script insertion. This may allow a remote attacker to inject HTML code including forms that load on a remote site, which can allow the attacker to conduct a phishing attack on a user and capture their credentials.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML code.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Persistent HTML Script Insertion",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can inject HTML code, including forms that load on a remote site. This allows the attacker to conduct phishing attacks, potentially capturing user credentials or redirecting users to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious user can inject HTML code into input fields, like the 'Description' field of 'Short document metadata'. When an unaware user views this data, the injected HTML is executed.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a low-privileged user account and some level of user interaction to trigger the execution of the injected code.",
     "additional_details": "The exploit-db entry notes that this is not the only way to inject malicious HTML code within the SpagoBI web application, implying other injection points might be present."
