Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Belkin WeMo Home Automation devices do not have a local certificate store to verify the integrity of SSL connections. This means that the device does not properly validate the SSL/TLS certificates used during communication, particularly during firmware updates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of SSL Certificate Validation:** The core vulnerability is the absence of proper certificate validation on the WeMo devices. This means that the device does not check if the SSL/TLS certificate presented by a server is valid, signed by a trusted authority, or corresponds to the expected server.
*   **Cleartext Firmware Update Channel:**  Although not directly related to certificate validation, the firmware update channel is delivered via an RSS-like mechanism over a non-encrypted channel, making it vulnerable to spoofing attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker positioned between a WeMo device and the update server could intercept communications and provide a malicious update to the device.
*   **Malicious Firmware Updates:** Because the device doesn't properly validate the SSL certificate and the update mechanism is unencrypted, an attacker could push a malicious firmware update to the device, potentially gaining full control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attack is performed by intercepting the network traffic between the WeMo device and the update server, or by spoofing the update server.
*   **Spoofed Update Server:** An attacker can set up a rogue update server, mimicking the legitimate server used by the WeMo devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the network communication between the WeMo device and the legitimate update server.
*   **Spoofing/DNS Manipulation:** The attacker can also achieve this by manipulating DNS or spoofing the update server to redirect the device to their malicious server.

**Additional Details:**
* The advisory also mentions that the firmware update notices are delivered through an RSS-like mechanism to the paired device rather than the WeMo device itself over a non-encrypted channel which makes the update mechanism more vulnerable to attack.
* The firmware updates are GPG encrypted however the encryption key is included in the firmware image, enabling attackers to sign malicious firmware updates.
