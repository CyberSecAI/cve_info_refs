The provided content relates to CVE-2013-6994.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application sends unique session identifiers in cleartext, allowing an attacker eavesdropping on TCP traffic to hijack an authenticated user session. This occurs even if the proxy server has enabled SSL encryption because the session identifier is sent before the SSL handshake.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of session identifiers.
- Session identifiers are sent before SSL handshake, even if SSL is enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking, allowing an attacker to gain access to an authenticated user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack by eavesdropping on TCP traffic between the EoD client and EoD Proxy.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to eavesdrop on and modify TCP traffic between the EoD client and the EoD Proxy server.

The content provides more technical detail than the standard CVE description, explaining the exact process of the attack and providing details such as the session ID format, the timing window of the attack, and example exploit code. It also details the interaction with other security measures such as SSL encryption.
