  "CVE-2013-6420": {
    "Description": "A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the openssl_x509_parse() function of the PHP openssl extension parsed X.509 certificates. A remote attacker could use this flaw to provide a malicious self-signed certificate or a certificate signed by a trusted authority to a PHP application using the aforementioned function, causing the application to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the PHP interpreter.",
    "Root cause": "Memory corruption flaw in the openssl\_x509\_parse() function of the PHP openssl extension when parsing X.509 certificates, due to improper handling of NUL bytes in ASN1 timestamp strings.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption",
      "Improper handling of null bytes"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a PHP application to crash, leading to denial of service. Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the PHP interpreter user may also be possible.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker provides a malicious self-signed certificate, or one signed by a trusted authority, to a PHP application using the openssl\_x509\_parse() function.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a malicious x509 certificate to a PHP application that uses the vulnerable openssl\_x509\_parse() function. If the function is used to verify a certificate from a trusted CA, then the attacker needs a malicious or compromised certificate signed by such CA."
