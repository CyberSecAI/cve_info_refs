Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-6410:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The nbd-server incorrectly parses access control lists (ACLs) when determining which clients are allowed to connect. It uses `strncmp()` incorrectly, leading to improper matching of IP addresses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect use of `strncmp()` in the parser for the ACL file. This function compares the beginning of the IP address string and doesn't check for complete matches.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation. Attackers can bypass access restrictions and connect to the nbd-server even if their full IP address is not explicitly listed in the ACL file.
- The issue allows clients to connect if their IP address shares a prefix with an allowed address. For example, if `198.51.100.1` is allowed, `198.51.100.12` would also be allowed to connect.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote. An attacker connects to the nbd-server over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate a connection to the nbd-server.
- The attacker's IP address needs to share a prefix with an allowed IP address listed in the server's access control list.
