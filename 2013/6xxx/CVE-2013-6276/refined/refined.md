- **Root cause of vulnerability**: During the firmware build process, authorized SSH keys were not properly removed, leading to the inclusion of default or test keys in the final firmware images. Specifically, keys for `rsa-key-20020513` and `rudy@mars` were present in some images, while others contained those keys plus keys for `hugo@localhost.localdomain`, `jasper@localhost.localdomain`, and `meiji@localhost.localdomain`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code**: The presence of the extra `authorized_keys` entries is a result of not cleaning up debug or testing artifacts from the firmware image.
    - **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials**: The hardcoded SSH keys in the `authorized_keys` file act as a form of hard-coded credentials.
    - **CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password**: The hardcoded private keys associated with the public keys found in authorized_keys are akin to hardcoded passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in possession of the private keys corresponding to the public keys present in the `authorized_keys` file could gain unauthorized remote access to the affected devices. This would essentially act as a "backdoor".
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote network access using SSH with the compromised private keys.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have the private keys that match the public keys listed in the `authorized_keys` files found on the affected firmware images and network access to the target device.
