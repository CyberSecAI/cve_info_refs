Author:
    Andrei Costin of "FIRMWARE.RE" project
    andrei@firmware.re
    andrei@andreicostin.com
    Vulnerability discovered using "FIRMWARE.RE" platform/service

Security advisory numbering:
    ACSA-2013-002

    CVE-2013-6276 (a procedure for building an image
sometimes results in the rsa-key-20020513 and rudy@mars keys remaining
in authorized_keys)

    CVE-2013-6277 (a different procedure for
building an image sometimes results in those keys plus three
@localhost.localdomain keys remaining in authorized_keys)

Vendor:
    QNAP / QNAP Security
    http://www.qnapsecurity.com/PressContact.asp
    http://www.qnap.com/

Product(s):
    VioCard-30 MPEG-4 Network DVR Card - Home, SOHO, Enterprise Video Surveillance Solutions
    VioGate-340(340A) - 4-channel network DVR server using the advanced MPEG-4 image encoding video chip to support 4-channel
    VioCard-100/300 - Digital network surveillance server

Product version(s) affected:
    F_VioCard30_2312_2.1.0.img
    F_VioGate340_2308_2.1.0.img
    VioCard300-RS_B4631/VioCard300-RS_B3722
    NOTE: Potentially other products affected as well. This list should be updated afterwards.

CWE categories:
    CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
    CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
    CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password

Vulnerability details:
    'authorized_keys' present in multiple QNAP products. This exposes the device users to the risk of being accessed in a 'backdoor' fashion by the owners of the private keys associated with the public keys listed in the 'authorized_keys' files. This also makes the owners of those keys good targets for private key theft.

    It is advised to remove the authorized_keys in a fixed update firmware. Also, it is advised for the private_key owners to change associated private keys and destroy all copies of private keys that might be of potential use to access the devices in a 'backdoor' fashion.

    Also, consult CWE listed above for more solutions advise.

    1) F_VioCard30_2312_2.1.0.img contains the following authorized_keys entries:
'80:aa:ed:ee:c0:63:68:09:eb:18:64:15:9d:d7:bf:03', '(RSA1)', 'rsa-key-20020513'
'ee:79:7c:6c:79:b7:9c:06:9d:fe:6c:e7:b2:c0:55:47', '(RSA1)', 'rudy@mars'

    2) F_VioGate340_2308_2.1.0.img contains the following authorized_keys entries:
'80:aa:ed:ee:c0:63:68:09:eb:18:64:15:9d:d7:bf:03', '(RSA1)', 'rsa-key-20020513'
'ee:79:7c:6c:79:b7:9c:06:9d:fe:6c:e7:b2:c0:55:47', '(RSA1)', 'rudy@mars'

    3) VioCard300-RS_B4631/VioCard300-RS_B3722 contains the following authorized_keys entries:
'80:aa:ed:ee:c0:63:68:09:eb:18:64:15:9d:d7:bf:03', '(RSA1)', 'rsa-key-20020513'
'ee:79:7c:6c:79:b7:9c:06:9d:fe:6c:e7:b2:c0:55:47', '(RSA1)', 'rudy@mars'
'40:1b:39:07:e5:92:ec:b2:b0:b0:14:a5:85:22:2b:f0', '(RSA1)', 'hugo@localhost.localdomain'
'98:a8:62:1c:35:67:c1:41:88:a9:b9:39:e5:54:e5:93', '(RSA1)', 'jasper@localhost.localdomain'
'04:86:8a:40:19:2d:4b:91:5f:c1:d3:c1:bf:5c:4c:2e', '(RSA1)', 'meiji@localhost.localdomain'
'80:aa:ed:ee:c0:63:68:09:eb:18:64:15:9d:d7:bf:03', '(RSA1)', 'rsa-key-20020513'
'ee:79:7c:6c:79:b7:9c:06:9d:fe:6c:e7:b2:c0:55:47', '(RSA1)', 'rudy@mars'

    Even thought vendor dismissed as "will not fix", we still thinkg there
    might be user who can be exposed, hence will find this report helpful
    Please consider upgrading from affected models.

Vendor comments:
    1. The issues only happened in the the specific old models (7 year ago).
    All the other models (at least for the recent 5 years) do not have this
    kind of issues.

    2. We no longer keep the authorized keys.  We conducted a check to make
    sure these keys are not kept on any of our servers. And we did not find
    any of these keys.

    3. QNAP attaches great importance to information security and network
    security. We would value it highly if customer still has security concern.
    They can contact us by nvr@qnap.com.

CVE@MITRE comments:
A single CVE can be used for multiple firmware images only if the
observed security problem is identical. We cannot assign a CVE for a
general business-process problem such as "QNAP does not clear out
authorized_keys files as part of their release engineering." Here,
item 3 is different. For purposes of CVE, we will model this as two
issues. The first issue is that a procedure for building an image
sometimes results in the rsa-key-20020513 and rudy@mars keys remaining
in authorized_keys. The second issue is that a different procedure for
building an image sometimes results in those keys plus three
@localhost.localdomain keys remaining in authorized_keys. Please see
the two CVE assignments below.

In the future, if you find additional images with different
combinations of keys, please ask for separate CVEs for those also.
