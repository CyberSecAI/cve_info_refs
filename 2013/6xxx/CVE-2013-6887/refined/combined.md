How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Fwd: [vs] multiple issues in openjpeg

Hi,

This was unembargoed yesterday, so here's a copy of the messages sent
to the distros list.
There were no responses, so no messages are missing.

In the meantime I've received a response from one of upstream authors,
Mathieu Malaterre, saying he would be reviewing the patches at a later
time.

This work was done as part of a review of openjpeg for EDF.

Cheers,
Raphael

Subject: [vs] multiple issues in openjpeg
To: distros () vs openwall org

Hi everyone,

During a review for EDF, I discovered multiple kinds of
vulnerabilities in openjpeg (different than CVE-2013-4289 and
CVE-2013-4290).

Summary:
* multiple denial of service (null ptr deref, high resource
consumption - in the order of 20GBs, division by zero, etc),
* invalid free()s (didn't check impact),
* out of bounds array reads and writes (similar to CVE-2012-3358, so
possibly exploitable to run arbitrary code),
* a format string bug (didn't check impact, at least DoS, ileak), and
* the use of uninitialized memory for all sorts of things.

Notice that this does not constitute a full review and that there
surely are more issues left in the code base.

Versions reviewed:
* 1.3 (with Debian's patches, as found in Debian squeeze and wheezy), and
* 1.5.1 (as found in Debian experimental).
Other versions might also be affected.

Upstream was contacted but got no response.

CVE-wise, I've classified the issues as following:

1. heap OOB reads, information leaks
2. ditto, but only affecting 1.5.1
3. heap OOB writes (CVE-2013-6045)
4. ditto but only affecting 1.3
5. null pointer dereferences, division by zero, and anything that
would just fit as DoS (CVE-2013-1447)
6. ditto, but only affecting 1.5.1

The two CVE ids above come from Debian's pool, but given the above
classification more ids are going to be needed. If there's an
agreement to the above, could somebody please assign some other ids?

Now, as for the vulnerabilities themselves, they are best described by
the attached patches. If details for any specific patch are desired
don't hesitate to ask. They should apply to both versions almost
as-is, if they don't, prod me.

Patches by categories defined above:

1.
shifting_too_much.patch
2.
segfault3.patch
3.
segfault0.patch
segfault1.patch
segfault2.patch
segfault5.patch
segfault7.patch
4.
qcx_backport.patch
5.
bloop1.patch
bloop2.patch
divbyzero.patch
null-ptr-deref.patch
segfault4.patch
segfault6.patch
segfault8.patch
segfault10.patch
uint_overflow.patch
6.
ifree1.patch

The patch that replaces malloc with calloc (segfault4.patch) is surely
enough just a workaround, but there are too many problems with the
code to spend further time on it.

Desired CDR: 3rd of December, 07:00 UTC

Cheers,
