  ## vBulletin Install System Exploit (vBulletin 4.1+, vBulletin 5+)

  Tue 27 Aug '13, 1:23pm

  Anexploit vector has been found in the vBulletin 4.1+ and 5+ installation directories. Our developers are investigating this issue at this time. If deemed necessary we will release the necessary patches. In order to prevent this issue on your vBulletin sites, it is recommended that you delete the install directory for your installation. The directories that should be deleted are:

  4.X - /install/

  5.X - /core/install

  After deleting these directories your sites can not be affected by the issues that we‚Äôre currently investigating.

  vBulletin 3.X and pre-4.1 would not be affected by these issues. However if you want the best security precautions, you can delete your install directory as well.

  There are four steps to securing your site. If you don't do them all or you do them in the wrong order than you're still susceptible to being attacked again.

  **Close the hole... This has three subparts in this instance.**
  1. Delete your install folder
  2. Review your admin users and delete any that don't belong. Don't ban them. Don't make them regular users. Delete them.
  3. Close access to your AdminCP using .htaccess. Use either user authorization with a different username and password or IP address restrictions.**Fill the Hole... There are seven subparts in this instance.**
  1. Review your files for changes. You can do this under Maintenance -> Diagnostics.
  2. Delete any Suspect Files.
  3. Replace any files marked as "Does not contain expected contents"
  4. Scan your plugins for malicious code (exec, base64, system, pass\_thru, iframe are all suspect keywords). Delete any you find.
  5. Repair any templates. Any templates that you don't have notes on changing, you need to revert. If you're using a custom style, it is best to delete your existing style and reimport from a fresh download.
  6. Update your Addon Products.
  7. Rebuild your datastores. You can use tools.php in the "do not upload" folder to do this. Upload it to your admincp directory, delete when done.**Secure the Hole**

  Parts of this were done by closing the hole but there are still things to do here.
  1. Keep notes of all changes you make to the system - what templates and phrases you change, what files belong to which addons, what plugins do the addons install.
  2. Consider using a separate Super Admin who has access to admin logs in the AdminCP. There should be only one Super Admin.
  3. Create a lower permission Administrator for every day use.
  4. Review your permissions in the system.
  5. Block off access to the includes, modcp, packages and vb folders via .htaccess. Deny All can work here, unless you use the ModCP. You need user authorization there.
  6. Move your attachments outside the forum root directory.
  7. Create a complete backup of your site. Make database backups weekly.**Vigilance**

  You need to keep active on the security of the site.
  1. Give out the fewest permissions necessary for anyone to do their job
  2. Make sure your hosting provider updates the software.
  3. Update to the latest vBulletin when it is released.
  4. Make sure your addons are always up to date.

  While this exploit is not possible in vBulletin 4.2.2 and 5.0.5, we still recommend that you delete your install folder in order to make your site as secure as possible.

# Dangerous vBulletin exploit in the wild

![](https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/articles/fire3.jpg)vBulletin is a popular proprietary CMS that was recently reported to be vulnerable to an unspecified attack vector. vBulletin is currently positioned 4th in the list of installed CMS sites on the Internet. Hence, the threat potential is huge.

Although vBulletin has not disclosed the root cause of the vulnerability or its impact, we determined the attacker‚Äôs methods. The identified vulnerability allows an attacker to abuse the vBulletin configuration mechanism in order to create a secondary administrative account. Once the attacker creates the account, they will have full control over the exploited vBulletin application, and subsequently the supported site.

**Initial analysis**

Although vBulletin has not disclosed the root cause of the vulnerability or the impact on customers, they did provide a workaround in a [blog](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/forum/vbulletin-announcements/vbulletin-announcements_aa/3991423-potential-vbulletin-exploit-vbulletin-4-1-vbulletin-5) post encouraging customers to delete the /install, /core/install in vBulleting 4.x and 5.x respectively.

Additionally, on vBulletin internal forums a victimized user [shared](http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?p=2443431) his server‚Äôs Apache log, providing some visibility into the attacker‚Äôs procedure:

![](https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/articles/vbulletin-imperva.jpg)

This log indicates that the attacker continuously scans, using ‚ÄúGET‚Äù requests, for the ‚Äú/install/upgrade.php‚Äù vulnerable resource. Once successful , indicated by the ‚Äú200‚Äùresponse code, as opposed to ‚Äú404‚Äù response code for non-existing resources, the attacker issues a ‚ÄúPOST‚Äù request to the same resource with the attack payload. Since the Apache logger does not log the parameters of POST requests, the details of the attack are not yet revealed.

Once we had access to some concrete technical details on the vulnerability, we were able to effectively scan hacker forums in search of an exploit code. Soon after, we found PHP code that implements the attack.

![](https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/articles/vbulletin-imperva2.jpg)

Next, we carefully installed the code in our lab. The interface clearly states the goal of the attack: injecting a new admin. In order to exploit the vulnerability and inject a new Admin user, the attacker needs to provide the following details:

* The vulnerable vBulletin upgrade.php exact URL
* The customer ID.

To get these details, the attackers created an additional auxiliary PHP script. The script scans a site for the vulnerable path, exactly as shown above in the reported Apache log, and extracts the customer ID from the vulnerable upgrade.php page, as it‚Äôs embedded within the page‚Äôs source code.

Consequently, the attacker now knows both the vBulletin‚Äôs upgarde.php vulnerable URL and the customer ID. With this information, the attack can be launched.

Here is an example of the POST request with the attack payload (the red fields match to the information the attacker needed to enter in the PHP interface above).

![](https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/articles/vbulletin-imperva3.jpg)

The result of the attack was exactly what the exploit package described. A new admin user was created (‚Äúeviladmin‚Äù) that is under the control of the attacker. The site has been successfully compromised.

Recommendations:

* vBulletin has advised its customers to delete /install and /core/install directories in versions 4.x and 5.x respectively.
* For vBulletin users not able to delete these directories ‚Äì it is advised to block access or redirect requests that hit upgrade.php through via either a WAF, or via web server access configuration.
