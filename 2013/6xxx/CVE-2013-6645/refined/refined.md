Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6645:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **use-after-free** issue related to speech input within the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** A memory location is freed and then later accessed, leading to undefined behavior and potential exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The provided content does not specify the precise impact, but use-after-free vulnerabilities can often be exploited for:
    *   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker could potentially overwrite memory after it has been freed, allowing them to execute code on the user's system.
    *   **Denial of service:** The use-after-free could cause the browser to crash.
    *   **Information disclosure:** The attacker could potentially read sensitive data that was previously stored in the freed memory.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when using speech input within the Chromium browser. The content does not provide details on specific methods for triggering.
*   An attacker would likely need to craft a malicious webpage or find other means to force the browser to use speech input in a specific way to trigger the use-after-free.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker would need the ability to influence a user's browsing activity or inject malicious content into a website the user visits, specifically targeting Chromium browser speech input.

**Additional notes:**

*   The content indicates that the vulnerability was discovered by Khalil Zhani.
*   The issue was fixed in Chromium version 32.0.1700.123-1 in Debian and 32.0.1700.102 in openSUSE.
