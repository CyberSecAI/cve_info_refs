## Details

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when inotify is used

to monitor the /dev/ptmx device. A local user could exploit this flaw to

discover keystroke timing and potentially discover sensitive information

like password length. ([CVE-2013-0160](/security/CVE-2013-0160))

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the Linux Kernel's kvm\_vm\_ioctl\_create\_vcpu

function of the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem. A local user could

exploit this flaw to gain privileges on the host machine. ([CVE-2013-4587](/security/CVE-2013-4587))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the apic\_get\_tmcct function of the Kernel

Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem if the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or host OS system crash.

([CVE-2013-6367](/security/CVE-2013-6367))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the

implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. ([CVE-2013-6382](/security/CVE-2013-6382))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7266](/security/CVE-2013-7266))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local

user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information

from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7267](/security/CVE-2013-7267))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](/security/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](/security/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](/security/CVE-2013-7270))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](/security/CVE-2013-7271))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM

driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](/security/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

([CVE-2014-1874](/security/CVE-2014-1874))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0284)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-4387, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite

implementation handled sending of certain UDP packets over sockets that
used the UDP\_CORK option when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) feature
was enabled on the output device. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4470, Important)

* A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the apic\_get\_tmcct() function in KVM's

Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (LAPIC) implementation.
A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2013-6367, Important)

* A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the way KVM handled virtual

APIC accesses that crossed a page boundary. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-6368, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the qeth\_snmp\_command()

function in the Linux kernel's QETH network device driver implementation
handled SNMP IOCTL requests with an out-of-bounds length. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-6381, Important)

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-2375 released via RHSA-2012:1580

accidentally removed a check for small-sized result buffers. A local,
unprivileged user with access to an NFSv4 mount with ACL support could use
this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
the system. (CVE-2013-4591, Moderate)

* A format string flaw was found in the Linux kernel's block layer.

A privileged, local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their
privileges to kernel level (ring0). (CVE-2013-2851, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Hannes Frederic Sowa for reporting
CVE-2013-4470, Andrew Honig of Google for reporting CVE-2013-6367 and
CVE-2013-6368, and Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2013-2851.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7265](/security/CVE-2013-7265))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7266](/security/CVE-2013-7266))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local

user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information

from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7267](/security/CVE-2013-7267))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](/security/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](/security/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](/security/CVE-2013-7270))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](/security/CVE-2013-7271))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-239-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-239.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-239.55)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](/security/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](/security/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](/security/CVE-2013-7270))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](/security/CVE-2013-7271))

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area

Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7281](/security/CVE-2013-7281))

halfdog reported an error in the AMD K7 and K8 platform support in the

Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw on AMD

based systems to cause a denial of service (task kill) or possibly gain

privileges via a crafted application. ([CVE-2014-1438](/security/CVE-2014-1438))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM

driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](/security/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

([CVE-2014-1874](/security/CVE-2014-1874))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1443-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1443.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1443.62)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# RHSA-2013:1801 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1801)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite

implementation handled sending of certain UDP packets over sockets that
used the UDP\_CORK option when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) feature
was enabled on the output device. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4470, Important)

* A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the apic\_get\_tmcct() function in KVM's

Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (LAPIC) implementation.
A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2013-6367, Important)

* A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the way KVM handled virtual

APIC accesses that crossed a page boundary. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-6368, Important)

* An information leak flaw in the Linux kernel could allow a local,

unprivileged user to leak kernel memory to user space. (CVE-2013-2141, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Hannes Frederic Sowa for reporting
CVE-2013-4470, and Andrew Honig of Google for reporting CVE-2013-6367 and
CVE-2013-6368.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds two enhancements.
Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
Technical Notes document linked to in the References section

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when inotify is used

to monitor the /dev/ptmx device. A local user could exploit this flaw to

discover keystroke timing and potentially discover sensitive information

like password length. ([CVE-2013-0160](/security/CVE-2013-0160))

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the Linux Kernel's kvm\_vm\_ioctl\_create\_vcpu

function of the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem. A local user could

exploit this flaw to gain privileges on the host machine. ([CVE-2013-4587](/security/CVE-2013-4587))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the apic\_get\_tmcct function of the Kernel

Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem if the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or host OS system crash.

([CVE-2013-6367](/security/CVE-2013-6367))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the

implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. ([CVE-2013-6382](/security/CVE-2013-6382))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7266](/security/CVE-2013-7266))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local

user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information

from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7267](/security/CVE-2013-7267))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](/security/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](/security/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](/security/CVE-2013-7270))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](/security/CVE-2013-7271))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM

driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](/security/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

([CVE-2014-1874](/security/CVE-2014-1874))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-362-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-362.75](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-362.75)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Important: kvm security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0163)

## Topic

Updated kvm packages that fix two security issues are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the apic\_get\_tmcct() function in KVM's
Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (LAPIC) implementation.
A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2013-6367)

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the way KVM handled virtual APIC
accesses that crossed a page boundary. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
the system. (CVE-2013-6368)

Red Hat would like to thank Andrew Honig of Google for reporting these
issues.

All kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. Note: the procedure in
the Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

The following procedure must be performed before this update will take
effect:

1) Stop all KVM guest virtual machines.

2) Either reboot the hypervisor machine or, as the root user, remove (using
"modprobe -r [module]") and reload (using "modprobe [module]") all of the
following modules which are currently running (determined using "lsmod"):
kvm, ksm, kvm-intel or kvm-amd.

3) Restart the KVM guest virtual machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-17.31~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-17.31~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](/security/CVE-2013-7271))

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area

Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7281](/security/CVE-2013-7281))

A flaw was discovered in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol

implementation in the Linux kernel for systems that lack RDS transports. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-7339](/security/CVE-2013-7339))

halfdog reported an error in the AMD K7 and K8 platform support in the

Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw on AMD

based systems to cause a denial of service (task kill) or possibly gain

privileges via a crafted application. ([CVE-2014-1438](/security/CVE-2014-1438))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM

driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](/security/CVE-2014-1446))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-17.31)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-17.31)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

KVM: x86: Fix potential divide by 0 in lapic ([CVE-2013-6367](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-57mh-hm58-7p4m "CVE-2013-6367"))

```
Under guest controllable circumstances apic_get_tmcct will execute a
divide by zero and cause a crash.  If the guest cpuid support
tsc deadline timers and performs the following sequence of requests
the host will crash.
- Set the mode to periodic
- Set the TMICT to 0
- Set the mode bits to 11 (neither periodic, nor one shot, nor tsc deadline)
- Set the TMICT to non-zero.
Then the lapic_timer.period will be 0, but the TMICT will not be.  If the
guest then reads from the TMCCT then the host will perform a divide by 0.

This patch ensures that if the lapic_timer.period is 0, then the division
does not occur.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-47.71~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

mmc: block: fix a bug of error handling in MMC driver
commit c8760069627ad3b0dbbea170f0c4c58b16e18d3d upstream.
Current MMC driver doesn't handle generic error (bit19 of device
status) in write sequence. As a result, write data gets lost when
generic error occurs. For example, a generic error when updating a
filesystem management information causes a loss of write data and
corrupts the filesystem. In the worst case, the system will never
boot.
This patch includes the following functionality:
1. To enable error checking for the response of CMD12 and CMD13
in write command sequence
2. To retry write sequence when a generic error occurs
Messages are added for v2 to show what occurs.

ftrace: Fix function graph with loading of modules
commit 8a56d7761d2d041ae5e8215d20b4167d8aa93f51 upstream.
Commit 8c4f3c3fa9681 "ftrace: Check module functions being traced on reload"
fixed module loading and unloading with respect to function tracing, but
it missed the function graph tracer. If you perform the following
# cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
# echo function\_graph > current\_tracer
# modprobe nfsd
# echo nop > current\_tracer
You'll get the following oops message:

The above mentioned commit didn't go far enough. Well, it covered the
function tracer by adding checks in \_\_register\_ftrace\_function(). The
problem is that the function graph tracer circumvents that (for a slight
efficiency gain when function graph trace is running with a function
tracer. The gain was not worth this).
The problem came with ftrace\_startup() which should always be called after
\_\_register\_ftrace\_function(), if you want this bug to be completely fixed.
Anyway, this solution moves \_\_register\_ftrace\_function() inside of
ftrace\_startup() and removes the need to call them both.

ftrace: Check module functions being traced on reload

---[ end trace 793179526ee09b2c ]---
It was finally narrowed down to unloading a module that was being traced.
It was actually more than that. When functions are being traced, there's
a table of all functions that have a ref count of the number of active
tracers attached to that function. When a function trace callback is
registered to a function, the function's record ref count is incremented.
When it is unregistered, the function's record ref count is decremented.
If an inconsistency is detected (ref count goes below zero) the above
warning is shown and the function tracing is permanently disabled until
reboot.
The ftrace callback ops holds a hash of functions that it filters on
(and/or filters off). If the hash is empty, the default means to filter
all functions (for the filter\_hash) or to disable no functions (for the
notrace\_hash).
When a module is unloaded, it frees the function records that represent
the module functions. These records exist on their own pages, that is
function records for one module will not exist on the same page as
function records for other modules or even the core kernel.
Now when a module unloads, the records that represents its functions are
freed. When the module is loaded again, the records are recreated with
a default ref count of zero (unless there's a callback that traces all
functions, then they will also be traced, and the ref count will be
incremented).
The problem is that if an ftrace callback hash includes functions of the
module being unloaded, those hash entries will not be removed. If the
module is reloaded in the same location, the hash entries still point
to the functions of the module but the module's ref counts do not reflect
that.
With the help of Steve and Joern, we found a reproducer:
Using uinput module and uinput\_release function.
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
modprobe uinput
echo uinput\_release > set\_ftrace\_filter
echo function > current\_tracer
rmmod uinput
modprobe uinput
# check /proc/modules to see if loaded in same addr, otherwise try again
echo nop > current\_tracer
[BOOM]
The above loads the uinput module, which creates a table of functions that
can be traced within the module.
We add uinput\_release to the filter\_hash to trace just that function.
Enable function tracincg, which increments the ref count of the record
associated to uinput\_release.
Remove uinput, which frees the records including the one that represents
uinput\_release.
Load the uinput module again (and make sure it's at the same address).
This recreates the function records all with a ref count of zero,
including uinput\_release.
Disable function tracing, which will decrement the ref count for uinput\_release
which is now zero because of the module removal and reload, and we have
a mismatch (below zero ref count).
The solution is to check all currently tracing ftrace callbacks to see if any
are tracing any of the module's functions when a module is loaded (it already does
that with callbacks that trace all functions). If a callback happens to have
a module function being traced, it increments that records ref count and starts
tracing that function.
There may be a strange side effect with this, where tracing module functions
on unload and then reloading a new module may have that new module's functions
being traced. This may be something that confuses the user, but it's not
a big deal. Another approach is to disable all callback hashes on module unload,
but this leaves some ftrace callbacks that may not be registered, but can
still have hashes tracing the module's function where ftrace doesn't know about
it. That situation can cause the same bug. This solution solves that case too.
Another benefit of this solution, is it is possible to trace a module's

ftrace: Create ftrace\_hash\_empty() helper routine
commit 06a51d9307380c78bb5c92e68fc80ad2c7d7f890 upstream.
There are two types of hashes in the ftrace\_ops; one type
is the filter\_hash and the other is the notrace\_hash. Either
one may be null, meaning it has no elements. But when elements
are added, the hash is allocated.
Throughout the code, a check needs to be made to see if a hash
exists or the hash has elements, but the check if the hash exists
is usually missing causing the possible "NULL pointer dereference bug".
Add a helper routine called "ftrace\_hash\_empty()" that returns
true if the hash doesn't exist or its count is zero. As they mean
the same thing.

ftrace: Fix ftrace hash record update with notrace
commit c842e975520f8ab09e293cc92f51a1f396251fd5 upstream.
When disabling the "notrace" records, that means we want to trace them.
If the notrace\_hash is zero, it means that we want to trace all
records. But to disable a zero notrace\_hash means nothing.
The check for the notrace\_hash count was incorrect with:
if (hash && !hash->count)
return
With the correct comment above it that states that we do nothing
if the notrace\_hash has zero count. But !hash also means that
the notrace hash has zero count. I think this was done to
protect against dereferencing NULL. But if !hash is true, then
we go through the following loop without doing a single thing.
Fix it to:
if (!hash || !hash->count)
return;

aacraid: prevent invalid pointer dereference
commit b4789b8e6be3151a955ade74872822f30e8cd914 upstream.
It appears that driver runs into a problem here if fibsize is too small
because we allocate user\_srbcmd with fibsize size only but later we
access it until user\_srbcmd->sg.count to copy it over to srbcmd.
It is not correct to test (fibsize < sizeof(\*user\_srbcmd)) because this
structure already includes one sg element and this is not needed for
commands without data. So, we would recommend to add the following
(instead of test for fibsize == 0).

this doesn't work at all for two reasons(The orignal transformed packet has
bad IPv4 checksum value, as well as wrong auth value, reported by wireshark)
- After transpormation, IPv4 header total length needs update,
because encrypted payload's length is NOT same as that of plain text.
- After transformation, IPv4 checksum needs re-caculate because of payload
has been changed.
With this patch, armmed pktgen with below cofiguration, Wireshark is able to

packet: fix use after free race in send path when dev is released
[ Upstream commit e40526cb20b5ee53419452e1f03d97092f144418 ]
Salam reported a use after free bug in PF\_PACKET that occurs when
we're sending out frames on a socket bound device and suddenly the
net device is being unregistered. It appears that commit 827d9780
introduced a possible race condition between {t,}packet\_snd() and
packet\_notifier(). In the case of a bound socket, packet\_notifier()
can drop the last reference to the net\_device and {t,}packet\_snd()
might end up suddenly sending a packet over a freed net\_device.
To avoid reverting 827d9780 and thus introducing a performance
regression compared to the current state of things, we decided to
hold a cached RCU protected pointer to the net device and maintain
it on write side via bind spin\_lock protected register\_prot\_hook()
and \_\_unregister\_prot\_hook() calls.
In {t,}packet\_snd() path, we access this pointer under rcu\_read\_lock
through packet\_cached\_dev\_get() that holds reference to the device
to prevent it from being freed through packet\_notifier() while
we're in send path. This is okay to do as dev\_put()/dev\_hold() are
per-cpu counters, so this should not be a performance issue. Also,
the code simplifies a bit as we don't need need\_rls\_dev anymore.

The reason is that when the bridge dev's address is changed, the

the bridge was removed, the address entry in the fdb did not free,
the bridge\_fdb\_cache still has objects when destroy the cache, Fix
this by flushing the bridge address entry when removing the bridge.
v2: according to the Toshiaki Makita and Vlad's suggestion, I only
delete the vlan0 entry, it still have a leak here if the vlan id
is other number, so I need to call fdb\_delete\_by\_port(br, NULL, 1)
to flush all entries whose dst is NULL for the bridge.

net: core: Always propagate flag changes to interfaces
[ Upstream commit d2615bf450694c1302d86b9cc8a8958edfe4c3a4 ]
The following commit:
b6c40d68ff6498b7f63ddf97cf0aa818d748dee7
net: only invoke dev->change\_rx\_flags when device is UP
tried to fix a problem with VLAN devices and promiscuouse flag setting.
The issue was that VLAN device was setting a flag on an interface that
was down, thus resulting in bad promiscuity count.
This commit blocked flag propagation to any device that is currently
down.
A later commit:
deede2fabe24e00bd7e246eb81cd5767dc6fcfc7
vlan: Don't propagate flag changes on down interfaces
fixed VLAN code to only propagate flags when the VLAN interface is up,
thus fixing the same issue as above, only localized to VLAN.
The problem we have now is that if we have create a complex stack
involving multiple software devices like bridges, bonds, and vlans,
then it is possible that the flags would not propagate properly to
the physical devices. A simple examle of the scenario is the
following:
eth0----> bond0 ----> bridge0 ---> vlan50
If bond0 or eth0 happen to be down at the time bond0 is added to
the bridge, then eth0 will never have promisc mode set which is
currently required for operation as part of the bridge. As a
result, packets with vlan50 will be dropped by the interface.
The only 2 devices that implement the special flag handling are
VLAN and DSA and they both have required code to prevent incorrect
flag propagation. As a result we can remove the generic solution
introduced in b6c40d68ff6498b7f63ddf97cf0aa818d748dee7 and leave
it to the individual devices to decide whether they will block
flag propagation or not.

net: add BUG\_ON if kernel advertises msg\_namelen > sizeof(struct sockaddr\_storage)
[ Upstream commit 68c6beb373955da0886d8f4f5995b3922ceda4be ]
In that case it is probable that kernel code overwrote part of the
stack. So we should bail out loudly here.
The BUG\_ON may be removed in future if we are sure all protocols are
conformant.

net: rework recvmsg handler msg\_name and msg\_namelen logic
[ Upstream commit f3d3342602f8bcbf37d7c46641cb9bca7618eb1c ]
This patch now always passes msg->msg\_namelen as 0. recvmsg handlers must
set msg\_namelen to the proper size <= sizeof(struct sockaddr\_storage)
to return msg\_name to the user.
This prevents numerous uninitialized memory leaks we had in the
recvmsg handlers and makes it harder for new code to accidentally leak
uninitialized memory.
Optimize for the case recvfrom is called with NULL as address. We don't
need to copy the address at all, so set it to NULL before invoking the
recvmsg handler. We can do so, because all the recvmsg handlers must
cope with the case a plain read() is called on them. read() also sets
msg\_name to NULL.
Also document these changes in include/linux/net.h as suggested by David
Miller.
Changes since RFC:
Set msg->msg\_name = NULL if user specified a NULL in msg\_name but had a
non-null msg\_namelen in verify\_iovec/verify\_compat\_iovec. This doesn't
affect sendto as it would bail out earlier while trying to copy-in the
address. It also more naturally reflects the logic by the callers of
verify\_iovec.
With this change in place I could remove "
if (!uaddr || msg\_sys->msg\_namelen == 0)
msg->msg\_name = NULL
".
This change does not alter the user visible error logic as we ignore
msg\_namelen as long as msg\_name is NULL.
Also remove two unnecessary curly brackets in \_\_\_sys\_recvmsg and change
comments to netdev style.

inet: prevent leakage of uninitialized memory to user in recv syscalls
[ Upstream commit bceaa90240b6019ed73b49965eac7d167610be69 ]
Only update \*addr\_len when we actually fill in sockaddr, otherwise we
can return uninitialized memory from the stack to the caller in the
recvfrom, recvmmsg and recvmsg syscalls. Drop the the (addr\_len == NULL)
checks because we only get called with a valid addr\_len pointer either
from sock\_common\_recvmsg or inet\_recvmsg.
If a blocking read waits on a socket which is concurrently shut down we
now return zero and set msg\_msgnamelen to 0.

connector: improved unaligned access error fix
[ Upstream commit 1ca1a4cf59ea343a1a70084fe7cc96f37f3cf5b1 ]
In af3e095a1fb4, Erik Jacobsen fixed one type of unaligned access
bug for ia64 by converting a 64-bit write to use put\_unaligned().
Unfortunately, since gcc will convert a short memset() to a series
of appropriately-aligned stores, the problem is now visible again
on tilegx, where the memset that zeros out proc\_event is converted
to three 64-bit stores, causing an unaligned access panic.
A better fix for the original problem is to ensure that proc\_event
is aligned to 8 bytes here. We can do that relatively easily by
arranging to start the struct cn\_msg aligned to 8 bytes and then
offset by 4 bytes. Doing so means that the immediately following
proc\_event structure is then correctly aligned to 8 bytes.
The result is that the memset() stores are now aligned, and as an
added benefit, we can remove the put\_unaligned() calls in the code.

6lowpan: Uncompression of traffic class field was incorrect
[ Upstream commit 1188f05497e7bd2f2614b99c54adfbe7413d5749 ]
If priority/traffic class field in IPv6 header is set (seen when
using ssh), the uncompression sets the TC and Flow fields incorrectly.
Example:
This is IPv6 header of a sent packet. Note the priority/TC (=1) in
the first byte.
00000000: 61 00 00 00 00 2c 06 40 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000010: 02 02 72 ff fe c6 42 10 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000020: 02 1e ab ff fe 4c 52 57
This gets compressed like this in the sending side
00000000: 72 31 04 06 02 1e ab ff fe 4c 52 57 ec c2 00 16
00000010: aa 2d fe 92 86 4e be c6 ....
In the receiving end, the packet gets uncompressed to this
IPv6 header
00000000: 60 06 06 02 00 2a 1e 40 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000010: 02 02 72 ff fe c6 42 10 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000020: ab ff fe 4c 52 57 ec c2
First four bytes are set incorrectly and we have also lost
two bytes from destination address.
The fix is to switch the case values in switch statement
when checking the TC field.

random32: fix off-by-one in seeding requirement
[ Upstream commit 51c37a70aaa3f95773af560e6db3073520513912 ]
For properly initialising the Tausworthe generator [1], we have
a strict seeding requirement, that is, s1 > 1, s2 > 7, s3 > 15.
Commit 697f8d0348 ("random32: seeding improvement") introduced
a \_\_seed() function that imposes boundary checks proposed by the
errata paper [2] to properly ensure above conditions.
However, we're off by one, as the function is implemented as:
"return (x < m) ? x + m : x;", and called with \_\_seed(X, 1),
\_\_seed(X, 7), \_\_seed(X, 15). Thus, an unwanted seed of 1, 7, 15
would be possible, whereas the lower boundary should actually
be of at least 2, 8, 16, just as GSL does. Fix this, as otherwise
an initialization with an unwanted seed could have the effect
that Tausworthe's PRNG properties cannot not be ensured.
Note that this PRNG is \*not\* used for cryptography in the kernel.

NULL, that means that overriding will not happen, because those default
routers were added without flag RTF\_ROUTEINFO in rt6\_add\_dflt\_router().

net: Fix "ip rule delete table 256"

When trying to delete a table >= 256 using iproute2 the local table
will be deleted.
The table id is specified as a netlink attribute when it needs more then
8 bits and iproute2 then sets the table field to RT\_TABLE\_UNSPEC (0).
Preconditions to matching the table id in the rule delete code
doesn't seem to take the "table id in netlink attribute" into condition
so the frh\_get\_table helper function never gets to do its job when
matching against current rule.
Use the helper function twice instead of peaking at the table value directly.

sched: Avoid throttle\_cfs\_rq() racing with period\_timer stopping
commit f9f9ffc237dd924f048204e8799da74f9ecf40cf upstream.
throttle\_cfs\_rq() doesn't check to make sure that period\_timer is running,
and while update\_curr/assign\_cfs\_runtime does, a concurrently running
period\_timer on another cpu could cancel itself between this cpu's
update\_curr and throttle\_cfs\_rq(). If there are no other cfs\_rqs running
in the tg to restart the timer, this causes the cfs\_rq to be stranded
forever.
Fix this by calling \_\_start\_cfs\_bandwidth() in throttle if the timer is
inactive.
(Also add some sched\_debug lines for cfs\_bandwidth.)
Tested: make a run/sleep task in a cgroup, loop switching the cgroup
between 1ms/100ms quota and unlimited, checking for timer\_active=0 and
throttled=1 as a failure. With the throttle\_cfs\_rq() change commented out
this fails, with the full patch it passes.

selinux: handle TCP SYN-ACK packets correctly in selinux\_ip\_postroute()
commit 446b802437f285de68ffb8d6fac3c44c3cab5b04 upstream.
In selinux\_ip\_postroute() we perform access checks based on the
packet's security label. For locally generated traffic we get the
packet's security label from the associated socket; this works in all
cases except for TCP SYN-ACK packets. In the case of SYN-ACK packet's
the correct security label is stored in the connection's request\_sock,
not the server's socket. Unfortunately, at the point in time when
selinux\_ip\_postroute() is called we can't query the request\_sock
directly, we need to recreate the label using the same logic that
originally labeled the associated request\_sock.

selinux: handle TCP SYN-ACK packets correctly in selinux\_ip\_output()
commit 47180068276a04ed31d24fe04c673138208b07a9 upstream.
In selinux\_ip\_output() we always label packets based on the parent
socket. While this approach works in almost all cases, it doesn't
work in the case of TCP SYN-ACK packets when the correct label is not
the label of the parent socket, but rather the label of the larval
socket represented by the request\_sock struct.
Unfortunately, since the request\_sock isn't queued on the parent
socket until \*after\* the SYN-ACK packet is sent, we can't lookup the
request\_sock to determine the correct label for the packet; at this
point in time the best we can do is simply pass/NF\_ACCEPT the packet.
It must be said that simply passing the packet without any explicit
labeling action, while far from ideal, is not terrible as the SYN-ACK
packet will inherit any IP option based labeling from the initial
connection request so the label \*should\* be correct and all our
access controls remain in place so we shouldn't have to worry about
information leaks.

dm bufio: initialize read-only module parameters
commit 4cb57ab4a2e61978f3a9b7d4f53988f30d61c27f upstream.
Some module parameters in dm-bufio are read-only. These parameters
inform the user about memory consumption. They are not supposed to be
changed by the user.
However, despite being read-only, these parameters can be set on
modprobe or insmod command line, for example:
modprobe dm-bufio current\_allocated\_bytes=12345
The kernel doesn't expect that these variables can be non-zero at module
initialization and if the user sets them, it results in BUG.
This patch initializes the variables in the module init routine, so that
user-supplied values are ignored.

UEFI time services are often broken once we're in virtual mode. We were
already refusing to use them on 64-bit systems, but it turns out that
they're also broken on some 32-bit firmware, including the Dell Venue.
Disable them for now, we can revisit once we have the 1:1 mappings code

dm snapshot: avoid snapshot space leak on crash
commit 230c83afdd9cd384348475bea1e14b80b3b6b1b8 upstream.
There is a possible leak of snapshot space in case of crash.
The reason for space leaking is that chunks in the snapshot device are
allocated sequentially, but they are finished (and stored in the metadata)
out of order, depending on the order in which copying finished.
For example, supposed that the metadata contains the following records
SUPERBLOCK
METADATA (blocks 0 ... 250)
DATA 0
DATA 1
DATA 2
...
DATA 250
Now suppose that you allocate 10 new data blocks 251-260. Suppose that
copying of these blocks finish out of order (block 260 finished first
and the block 251 finished last). Now, the snapshot device looks like
this:
SUPERBLOCK
METADATA (blocks 0 ... 250, 260, 259, 258, 257, 256)
DATA 0
DATA 1
DATA 2
...
DATA 250
DATA 251
DATA 252
DATA 253
DATA 254
DATA 255
METADATA (blocks 255, 254, 253, 252, 251)
DATA 256
DATA 257
DATA 258
DATA 259
DATA 260
Now, if the machine crashes after writing the first metadata block but
before writing the second metadata block, the space for areas DATA 250-255
is leaked, it contains no valid data and it will never be used in the
future.
This patch makes dm-snapshot complete exceptions in the same order they
were allocated, thus fixing this bug.
Note: when backporting this patch to the stable kernel, change the version
field in the following way:
\* if version in the stable kernel is {1, 11, 1}, change it to {1, 12, 0}
\* if version in the stable kernel is {1, 10, 0} or {1, 10, 1}, change it
to {1, 10, 2}
Userspace reads the version to determine if the bug was fixed, so the
version change is needed.

ALSA: memalloc.h - fix wrong truncation of dma\_addr\_t
commit 932e9dec380c67ec15ac3eb073bb55797d8b4801 upstream.
When running a 32bit kernel the hda\_intel driver is still reporting
a 64bit dma\_mask if the HW supports it.
From sound/pci/hda/hda\_intel.c:
/\* allow 64bit DMA address if supported by H/W \*/
if ((gcap & ICH6\_GCAP\_64OK) && !pci\_set\_dma\_mask(pci, DMA\_BIT\_MASK(64)))
pci\_set\_consistent\_dma\_mask(pci, DMA\_BIT\_MASK(64));
else {
pci\_set\_dma\_mask(pci, DMA\_BIT\_MASK(32));
pci\_set\_consistent\_dma\_mask(pci, DMA\_BIT\_MASK(32));
}
which means when there is a call to dma\_alloc\_coherent from
snd\_malloc\_dev\_pages a machine address bigger than 32bit can be returned.
This can be true in particular if running the 32bit kernel as a pv dom0
under the Xen Hypervisor or PAE on bare metal.
The problem is that when calling setup\_bdle to program the BLE the
dma\_addr\_t returned from the dma\_alloc\_coherent is wrongly truncated
from snd\_sgbuf\_get\_addr if running a 32bit kernel:
static inline dma\_addr\_t snd\_sgbuf\_get\_addr(struct snd\_dma\_buffer \*dmab,
size\_t offset)
{
struct snd\_sg\_buf \*sgbuf = dmab->private\_data;
dma\_addr\_t addr = sgbuf->table[offset >> PAGE\_SHIFT].addr;
addr &= PAGE\_MASK;
return addr + offset % PAGE\_SIZE;
}
where PAGE\_MASK in a 32bit kernel is zeroing the upper 32bit af addr.
Without this patch the HW will fetch the 32bit truncated address,
which is not the one obtained from dma\_alloc\_coherent and will result
to a non working audio but can corrupt host memory at a random location.
The current patch apply to v3.13-rc3-74-g6c843f5

In checkin
5551a34e5aea x86-64, build: Always pass in -mno-sse
we unconditionally added -mno-sse to the main build, to keep newer
compilers from generating SSE instructions from autovectorization.
However, this did not extend to the special environments
(arch/x86/boot, arch/x86/boot/compressed, and arch/x86/realmode/rm).
Add -mno-sse to the compiler command line for these environments, and
add -mno-mmx to all the environments as well, as we don't want a
compiler to generate MMX code either.
This patch also removes a $(cc-option) call for -m32, since we have
long since stopped supporting compilers too old for the -m32 option,
and in fact hardcode it in other places in the Makefiles.

ARM: 7912/1: check stack pointer in get\_wchan
commit 1b15ec7a7427d4188ba91b9bbac696250a059d22 upstream.
get\_wchan() is lockless. Task may wakeup at any time and change its own stack,
thus each next stack frame may be overwritten and filled with random stuff.
/proc/$pid/stack interface had been disabled for non-current tasks, see [1]
But 'wchan' still allows to trigger stack frame unwinding on volatile stack.
This patch fixes oops in unwind\_frame() by adding stack pointer validation on
each step (as x86 code do), unwind\_frame() already checks frame pointer.
Also I've found another report of this oops on stackoverflow (irony).

powerpc/gpio: Fix the wrong GPIO input data on MPC8572/MPC8536
commit 1aeef303b5d9e243c41d5b80f8bb059366514a10 upstream.
For MPC8572/MPC8536, the status of GPIOs defined as output
cannot be determined by reading GPDAT register, so the code
use shadow data register instead. But the code may give the
wrong status of GPIOs defined as input under some scenarios:
1. If some pins were configured as inputs and were asserted
high before booting the kernel, the shadow data has been
initialized with those pin values.
2. Some pins have been configured as output first and have
been set to the high value, then reconfigured as input.
The above cases will make the shadow data for those input
pins to be set to high. Then reading the pin status will
always return high even if the actual pin status is low.
The code should eliminate the effects of the shadow data to
the input pins, and the status of those pins should be
read directly from GPDAT.

To test the patch it's sufficient to call

hpsa: return 0 from driver probe function on success, not 1
commit 88bf6d62db4393fa03a58bada9d746312d5b496f upstream.
A return value of 1 is interpreted as an error. See pci\_driver.
in local\_pci\_probe(). If you're wondering how this ever could
have worked, it's because it used to be the case that only return
values less than zero were interpreted as failure. But even in
the current kernel if the driver registers its various entry
points with the kernel, and then returns a value which is
interpreted as failure, those registrations aren't undone, so
the driver still mostly works. However, the driver's remove
function wouldn't be called on rmmod, and pci power management
functions wouldn't work. In the case of Smart Array, since it
has a battery backed cache (or else no cache) even if the driver
is not shut down properly as long as there is no outstanding
i/o, nothing too bad happens, which is why it took so long to
notice.
Requesting backport to stable because the change to pci-driver.c
which requires driver probe functions to return 0 occurred between
2.6.35 and 2.6.36 (the pci power management breakage) and again
between 3.7 and 3.8 (pci\_dev->driver getting set to NULL in
local\_pci\_probe() preventing driver remove function from being
called on rmmod.)

ARM: footbridge: fix VGA initialisation
commit 43659222e7a0113912ed02f6b2231550b3e471ac upstream.
It's no good setting vga\_base after the VGA console has been
initialised, because if we do that we get this:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 000b8000
pgd = c0004000

net: update consumers of MSG\_MORE to recognize MSG\_SENDPAGE\_NOTLAST
commit d3f7d56a7a4671d395e8af87071068a195257bf6 upstream.
Commit 35f9c09fe (tcp: tcp\_sendpages() should call tcp\_push() once)
added an internal flag MSG\_SENDPAGE\_NOTLAST, similar to
MSG\_MORE.
algif\_hash, algif\_skcipher, and udp used MSG\_MORE from tcp\_sendpages()
and need to see the new flag as identical to MSG\_MORE.
This fixes sendfile() on AF\_ALG.

Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
This is because the macro operations in smc91x.h defined
for Versatile are missing SMC\_outsw() as used in this
commit.
The Versatile needs and uses the same accessors as the other
platforms in the first if(...) clause, just switch it to using
that and we have one problem less to worry about.
This includes a hunk of a patch from Will Deacon fixin
the other 32bit platforms as well: Innokom, Ramses, PXA,
PCM027.
Checkpatch complains about spacing, but I have opted to
follow the style of this .h-file.

crypto: ccm - Fix handling of zero plaintext when computing mac
commit 5638cabf3e4883f38dfb246c30980cebf694fbda upstream.
There are cases when cryptlen can be zero in crypto\_ccm\_auth():
-encryptiom: input scatterlist length is zero (no plaintext)
-decryption: input scatterlist contains only the mac
plus the condition of having different source and destination buffers
(or else scatterlist length = max(plaintext\_len, ciphertext\_len)).
These are not handled correctly, leading to crashes like:

crypto: s390 - Fix aes-xts parameter corruption
commit 9dda2769af4f3f3093434648c409bb351120d9e8 upstream.
Some s390 crypto algorithms incorrectly use the crypto\_tfm structure to
store private data. As the tfm can be shared among multiple threads, this
can result in data corruption.
This patch fixes aes-xts by moving the xts and pcc parameter blocks from
the tfm onto the stack (48 + 96 bytes).

crypto: scatterwalk - Set the chain pointer indication bit
commit 41da8b5adba77e22584f8b45f9641504fa885308 upstream.
The scatterwalk\_crypto\_chain function invokes the scatterwalk\_sg\_chain
function to chain two scatterlists, but the chain pointer indication
bit is not set. When the resulting scatterlist is used, for example,
by sg\_nents to count the number of scatterlist entries, a segfault occurs
because sg\_nents does not follow the chain pointer to the chained scatterlist.
Update scatterwalk\_sg\_chain to set the chain pointer indication bit as is
done by the sg\_chain function.

Which reports that we take mems\_allowed\_seq with interrupts enabled. A
little digging found that this can only be from
cpuset\_change\_task\_nodemask().
This is an actual deadlock because an interrupt doing an allocation will
hit get\_mems\_allowed()->...->\_\_read\_seqcount\_begin(), which will spin
forever waiting for the write side to complete.

to ata\_tf\_to\_fis(). Praveen reports that eSATA attached drives do not
discover correctly. His investigation found that the BIOS was passing
pmp=0 while Linux was passing pmp=1 and failing to discover the drives.
Update libsas to follow the libata example of pulling the pmp setting
from the ata\_link and correct is\_cmd to be 1 since all tf's submitted
through ->qc\_issue are commands. Presumably libsas lldds do not care
about is\_cmd as they have sideband mechanisms to perform link
management.

to check for NULL and if it is, it will assign "(null)" to it instead
(similar to what glibc printf does).

irq: Enable all irqs unconditionally in irq\_resume
commit ac01810c9d2814238f08a227062e66a35a0e1ea2 upstream.
When the system enters suspend, it disables all interrupts in
suspend\_device\_irqs(), including the interrupts marked EARLY\_RESUME.
On the resume side things are different. The EARLY\_RESUME interrupts
are reenabled in sys\_core\_ops->resume and the non EARLY\_RESUME
interrupts are reenabled in the normal system resume path.
When suspend\_noirq() failed or suspend is aborted for any other
reason, we might omit the resume side call to sys\_core\_ops->resume()
and therefor the interrupts marked EARLY\_RESUME are not reenabled and
stay disabled forever.
To solve this, enable all irqs unconditionally in irq\_resume()
regardless whether interrupts marked EARLY\_RESUMEhave been already
enabled or not.
This might try to reenable already enabled interrupts in the non
failure case, but the only affected platform is XEN and it has been
confirmed that it does not cause any side effects.

commit 46a51c80216cb891f271ad021f59009f34677499 upstream.
This patch fixes the bug in reset\_store caused by accessing NULL pointer.
The bdev gets its value from bdget\_disk() which could fail when memory
pressure is severe and hence can return NULL because allocation of
inode in bdget could fail.
Hence, this patch introduces a check for bdev to prevent reference to a
NULL pointer in the later part of the code. It also removes unnecessary
check of bdev for fsync\_bdev().

USB: serial: fix race in generic write
commit 6f6485463aada1ec6a0f3db6a03eb8e393d6bb55 upstream.
Fix race in generic write implementation, which could lead to
temporarily degraded throughput.
The current generic write implementation introduced by commit
27c7acf22047 ("USB: serial: reimplement generic fifo-based writes") has
always had this bug, although it's fairly hard to trigger and the
consequences are not likely to be noticed.
Specifically, a write() on one CPU while the completion handler is
running on another could result in only one of the two write urbs being
utilised to empty the remainder of the write fifo (unless there is a
second write() that doesn't race during that time).

reorder them. Trying to do so would cause the reorder to stop
working correctly since multicast QoS frames (as transmitted by

powerpc/signals: Improved mark VSX not saved with small contexts fix
commit ec67ad82814bee92251fd963bf01c7a173856555 upstream.
In a recent patch:
commit c13f20ac48328b05cd3b8c19e31ed6c132b44b42
Author: Michael Neuling
powerpc/signals: Mark VSX not saved with small contexts
We fixed an issue but an improved solution was later discussed after the patch
was merged.
Firstly, this patch doesn't handle the 64bit signals case, which could also hit
this issue (but has never been reported).
Secondly, the original patch isn't clear what MSR VSX should be set to. The
new approach below always clears the MSR VSX bit (to indicate no VSX is in the
context) and sets it only in the specific case where VSX is available (ie. when
VSX has been used and the signal context passed has space to provide the
state).
This reverts the original patch and replaces it with the improved solution. It
also adds a 64 bit version.

configfs: fix race between dentry put and lookup
commit 76ae281f6307331aa063288edb6422ae99f435f0 upstream.
A race window in configfs, it starts from one dentry is UNHASHED and end
before configfs\_d\_iput is called. In this window, if a lookup happen,
since the original dentry was UNHASHED, so a new dentry will be
allocated, and then in configfs\_attach\_attr(), sd->s\_dentry will be
updated to the new dentry. Then in configfs\_d\_iput(),
BUG\_ON(sd->s\_dentry != dentry) will be triggered and system panic.
sys\_open: sys\_close:
... fput
dput
dentry\_kill
\_\_d\_drop <--- dentry unhashed here,
but sd->dentry still point
to this dentry.
lookup\_real
configfs\_lookup
configfs\_attach\_attr---> update sd->s\_dentry
to new allocated dentry here.
d\_kill
configfs\_d\_iput <--- BUG\_ON(sd->s\_dentry != dentry)
triggered here.
To fix it, change configfs\_d\_iput to not update sd->s\_dentry if
sd->s\_count > 2, that means there are another dentry is using the sd
beside the one that is going to be put. Use configfs\_dirent\_lock in
configfs\_attach\_attr to sync with configfs\_d\_iput.
With the following steps, you can reproduce the bug.
1. enable ocfs2, this will mount configfs at /sys/kernel/config and
fill configure in it.
2. run the following script.
while [ 1 ]; do cat /sys/kernel/config/cluster/$your\_cluster\_name/idle\_timeout\_ms > /dev/null; done &
while [ 1 ]; do cat /sys/kernel/config/cluster/$your\_cluster\_name/idle\_timeout\_ms > /dev/null; done &

e.g. "usernameXXXXX" will be permitted to match "username".
Just check one more byte so the trailing null char is also matched.

powerpc/signals: Mark VSX not saved with small contexts
commit c13f20ac48328b05cd3b8c19e31ed6c132b44b42 upstream.
The VSX MSR bit in the user context indicates if the context contains VSX
state. Currently we set this when the process has touched VSX at any stage.
Unfortunately, if the user has not provided enough space to save the VSX state,
we can't save it but we currently still set the MSR VSX bit.
This patch changes this to clear the MSR VSX bit when the user doesn't provide
enough space. This indicates that there is no valid VSX state in the user
context.
This is needed to support get/set/make/swapcontext for applications that use
VSX but only provide a small context. For example, getcontext in glibc
provides a smaller context since the VSX registers don't need to be saved over
the glibc function call. But since the program calling getcontext may have
used VSX, the kernel currently says the VSX state is valid when it's not. If
the returned context is then used in setcontext (ie. a small context without
VSX but with MSR VSX set), the kernel will refuse the context. This situation
has been reported by the glibc community.
Based on patch from Carlos O'Donell.

The problem is in scan\_dispatch\_log() where we call dtl\_consumer()
but bail out before incrementing the index.
To fix this I moved dtl\_consumer() after the timebase comparison.

commit e7cc5cf74544d97d7b69e2701595037474db1f96 upstream.
The pcie\_portdrv .probe() method calls pci\_enable\_device() once, in
pcie\_port\_device\_register(), but the .remove() method calls
pci\_disable\_device() twice, in pcie\_port\_device\_remove() and in
pcie\_portdrv\_remove().
That causes a "disabling already-disabled device" warning when removing a
PCIe port device. This happens all the time when removing Thunderbolt
devices, but is also easy to reproduce with, e.g.,
"echo 0000:00:1c.3 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pcieport/unbind"
This patch removes the disable from pcie\_portdrv\_remove().

NFSv4: Update list of irrecoverable errors on DELEGRETURN
commit c97cf606e43b85a6cf158b810375dd77312024db upstream.
If the DELEGRETURN errors out with something like NFS4ERR\_BAD\_STATEID
then there is no recovery possible. Just quit without returning an error.
Also, note that the client must not assume that the NFSv4 lease has been
renewed when it sees an error on DELEGRETURN.

NFSv4 wait on recovery for async session errors
commit 4a82fd7c4e78a1b7a224f9ae8bb7e1fd95f670e0 upstream.
When the state manager is processing the NFS4CLNT\_DELEGRETURN flag, session
draining is off, but DELEGRETURN can still get a session error.
The async handler calls nfs4\_schedule\_session\_recovery returns -EAGAIN, and
the DELEGRETURN done then restarts the RPC task in the prepare state.
With the state manager still processing the NFS4CLNT\_DELEGRETURN flag with
session draining off, these DELEGRETURNs will cycle with errors filling up the
session slots.
This prevents OPEN reclaims (from nfs\_delegation\_claim\_opens) required by the
NFS4CLNT\_DELEGRETURN state manager processing from completing, hanging the
state manager in the \_\_rpc\_wait\_for\_completion\_task in nfs4\_run\_open\_task
as seen in this kernel thread dump:

avr32: fix out-of-range jump in large kernels
commit d617b338bbfdd77e9cbd8e7dc949cee3dd73d575 upstream.
This patch fixes following error (for big kernels):
---8<---
arch/avr32/boot/u-boot/head.o: In function `no\_tag\_table':
(.init.text+0x44): relocation truncated to fit: R\_AVR32\_22H\_PCREL against symbol `panic' defined in .text.unlikely section in kernel/built-in.o
arch/avr32/kernel/built-in.o: In function `bad\_return':
(.ex.text+0x236): relocation truncated to fit: R\_AVR32\_22H\_PCREL against symbol `panic' defined in .text.unlikely section in kernel/built-in.o
--->8---
It comes up when the kernel increases and 'panic()' is too far away to fit in
the +/- 2MiB range. Which in turn issues from the 21-bit displacement in
'br{cond4}' mnemonic which is one of the two ways to do jumps (rjmp has just
10-bit displacement and therefore a way smaller range). This fact was stated
before in 8d29b7b9f81d6b83d869ff054e6c189d6da73f1f.
One solution to solve this is to add a local storage for the symbol address
and just load the $pc with that value.

nfsd4: fix xdr decoding of large non-write compounds
commit 365da4adebb1c012febf81019ad3dc5bb52e2a13 upstream.
This fixes a regression from 247500820ebd02ad87525db5d9b199e5b66f6636
"nfsd4: fix decoding of compounds across page boundaries". The previous
code was correct: argp->pagelist is initialized in
nfs4svc\_deocde\_compoundargs to rqstp->rq\_arg.pages, and is therefore a
pointer to the page \*after\* the page we are currently decoding.
The reason that patch nevertheless fixed a problem with decoding
compounds containing write was a bug in the write decoding introduced by
5a80a54d21c96590d013378d8c5f65f879451ab4 "nfsd4: reorganize write
decoding", after which write decoding no longer adhered to the rule that
argp->pagelist point to the next page.

ipc, msg: fix message length check for negative values
commit 4e9b45a19241354daec281d7a785739829b52359 upstream.
On 64 bit systems the test for negative message sizes is bogus as the
size, which may be positive when evaluated as a long, will get truncated
to an int when passed to load\_msg(). So a long might very well contain a
positive value but when truncated to an int it would become negative.
That in combination with a small negative value of msg\_ctlmax (which will
be promoted to an unsigned type for the comparison against msgsz, making
it a big positive value and therefore make it pass the check) will lead to
two problems: 1/ The kmalloc() call in alloc\_msg() will allocate a too
small buffer as the addition of alen is effectively a subtraction. 2/ The
copy\_from\_user() call in load\_msg() will first overflow the buffer with
userland data and then, when the userland access generates an access
violation, the fixup handler copy\_user\_handle\_tail() will try to fill the
remainder with zeros -- roughly 4GB. That almost instantly results in a
system crash or reset.

|
| return 0;
| }
'---
Fix the issue by preventing msgsz from getting truncated by consistently
using size\_t for the message length. This way the size checks in
do\_msgsnd() could still be passed with a negative value for msg\_ctlmax but
we would fail on the buffer allocation in that case and error out.
Also change the type of m\_ts from int to size\_t to avoid similar nastiness
in other code paths -- it is used in similar constructs, i.e. signed vs.
unsigned checks. It should never become negative under normal
circumstances, though.
Setting msg\_ctlmax to a negative value is an odd configuration and should
be prevented. As that might break existing userland, it will be handled
in a separate commit so it could easily be reverted and reworked without
reintroducing the above described bug.
Hardening mechanisms for user copy operations would have catched that bug
early -- e.g. checking slab object sizes on user copy operations as the
usercopy feature of the PaX patch does. Or, for that matter, detect the
long vs. int sign change due to truncation, as the size overflow plugin
of the very same patch does.

devpts: plug the memory leak in kill\_sb
commit 66da0e1f9034140ae2f571ef96e254a25083906c upstream.
When devpts is unmounted, there may be a no-longer-used IDR tree hanging
off the superblock we are about to kill. This needs to be cleaned up
before destroying the SB.
The leak is usually not a big deal because unmounting devpts is typically
done when shutting down the whole machine. However, shutting down an LXC
container instead of a physical machine exposes the problem (the garbage
is detectable with kmemleak).

exec/ptrace: fix get\_dumpable() incorrect tests
commit d049f74f2dbe71354d43d393ac3a188947811348 upstream.
The get\_dumpable() return value is not boolean. Most users of the
function actually want to be testing for non-SUID\_DUMP\_USER(1) rather than
SUID\_DUMP\_DISABLE(0). The SUID\_DUMP\_ROOT(2) is also considered a
protected state. Almost all places did this correctly, excepting the two
places fixed in this patch.
Wrong logic:
if (dumpable == SUID\_DUMP\_DISABLE) { /\* be protective \*/ }
or
if (dumpable == 0) { /\* be protective \*/ }
or
if (!dumpable) { /\* be protective \*/ }
Correct logic:
if (dumpable != SUID\_DUMP\_USER) { /\* be protective \*/ }
or
if (dumpable != 1) { /\* be protective \*/ }
Without this patch, if the system had set the sysctl fs/suid\_dumpable=2, a
user was able to ptrace attach to processes that had dropped privileges to
that user. (This may have been partially mitigated if Yama was enabled.)
The macros have been moved into the file that declares get/set\_dumpable(),
which means things like the ia64 code can see them too.

vsprintf: check real user/group id for %pK
commit 312b4e226951f707e120b95b118cbc14f3d162b2 upstream.
Some setuid binaries will allow reading of files which have read
permission by the real user id. This is problematic with files which
use %pK because the file access permission is checked at open() time,
but the kptr\_restrict setting is checked at read() time. If a setuid
binary opens a %pK file as an unprivileged user, and then elevates
permissions before reading the file, then kernel pointer values may be
leaked.
This happens for example with the setuid pppd application on Ubuntu 12.04:
$ head -1 /proc/kallsyms
00000000 T startup\_32

pppd: In file /proc/kallsyms: unrecognized option 'c1000000'
This will only leak the pointer value from the first line, but other
setuid binaries may leak more information.
Fix this by adding a check that in addition to the current process having
CAP\_SYSLOG, that effective user and group ids are equal to the real ids.
If a setuid binary reads the contents of a file which uses %pK then the
pointer values will be printed as NULL if the real user is unprivileged.
Update the sysctl documentation to reflect the changes, and also correct
the documentation to state the kptr\_restrict=0 is the default.
This is a only temporary solution to the issue. The correct solution is
to do the permission check at open() time on files, and to replace %pK
with a function which checks the open() time permission. %pK uses in
printk should be removed since no sane permission check can be done, and
instead protected by using dmesg\_restrict.

mtd: gpmi: fix kernel BUG due to racing DMA operations
commit 7b3d2fb92067bcb29f0f085a9fa9fa64920a6646 upstream.
[1] The gpmi uses the nand\_command\_lp to issue the commands to NAND chips.
The gpmi issues a DMA operation with gpmi\_cmd\_ctrl when it handles
a NAND\_CMD\_NONE control command. So when we read a page(NAND\_CMD\_READ0)
from the NAND, we may send two DMA operations back-to-back.
If we do not serialize the two DMA operations, we will meet a bug when
1.1) we enable CONFIG\_DMA\_API\_DEBUG, CONFIG\_DMADEVICES\_DEBUG,
and CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SG.
1.2) Use the following commands in an UART console and a SSH console:
cmd 1: while true;do dd if=/dev/mtd0 of=/dev/null;done
cmd 1: while true;do dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/null;done
The kernel log shows below:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
kernel BUG at lib/scatterlist.c:28!
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000

-----------------------------------------------------------------
1.3) Assume the two DMA operations is X (first) and Y (second).
The root cause of the bug:
Assume process P issues DMA X, and sleep on the completion
@this->dma\_done. X's tasklet callback is dma\_irq\_callback. It firstly
wake up the process sleeping on the completion @this->dma\_done,
and then trid to unmap the scatterlist S. The waked process P will
issue Y in another ARM core. Y initializes S->sg\_magic to zero
with sg\_init\_one(), while dma\_irq\_callback is unmapping S at the same
time.
See the diagram:
ARM core 0 | ARM core 1
-------------------------------------------------------------
(P issues DMA X, then sleep) --> |
|
(X's tasklet wakes P) --> |
|
| <-- (P begin to issue DMA Y)
|
(X's tasklet unmap the |
scatterlist S with dma\_unmap\_sg) --> | <-- (Y calls sg\_init\_one() to init
| scatterlist S)
|
[2] This patch serialize both the X and Y in the following way:
Unmap the DMA scatterlist S firstly, and wake up the process at the end
of the DMA callback, in such a way, Y will be executed after X.
After this patch:
ARM core 0 | ARM core 1
-------------------------------------------------------------
(P issues DMA X, then sleep) --> |
|
(X's tasklet unmap the |
scatterlist S with dma\_unmap\_sg) --> |
|
(X's tasklet wakes P) --> |
|
| <-- (P begin to issue DMA Y)
|
| <-- (Y calls sg\_init\_one() to init
| scatterlist S)

rtlwifi: Fix endian error in extracting packet type
commit 0c5d63f0ab6728f05ddefa25aff55e31297f95e6 upstream.
All of the rtlwifi drivers have an error in the routine that tests if
the data is "special". If it is, the subsequant transmission will be
at the lowest rate to enhance reliability. The 16-bit quantity is
big-endian, but was being extracted in native CPU mode. One of the
effects of this bug is to inhibit association under some conditions
as the TX rate is too high.
Based on suggestions by Joe Perches, the entire routine is rewritten.
One of the local headers contained duplicates of some of the ETH\_P\_XXX
definitions. These are deleted.

qib\_user\_sdma\_queue\_pkts() gets called with mmap\_sem held for

more interestingly the function qib\_user\_sdma\_queue\_pkts() (and also

which can hit a page fault and we deadlock on trying to get mmap\_sem
when handling that fault.
So just make qib\_user\_sdma\_pin\_pages() use get\_user\_pages\_fast() and
leave mmap\_sem locking for mm.
This deadlock has actually been observed in the wild when the node
is under memory pressure.

SUNRPC: Fix a data corruption issue when retransmitting RPC calls
commit a6b31d18b02ff9d7915c5898c9b5ca41a798cd73 upstream.
The following scenario can cause silent data corruption when doing
NFS writes. It has mainly been observed when doing database writes
using O\_DIRECT.
1) The RPC client uses sendpage() to do zero-copy of the page data.
2) Due to networking issues, the reply from the server is delayed,
and so the RPC client times out.
3) The client issues a second sendpage of the page data as part of
an RPC call retransmission.
4) The reply to the first transmission arrives from the server
\_before\_ the client hardware has emptied the TCP socket send
buffer.
5) After processing the reply, the RPC state machine rules that
the call to be done, and triggers the completion callbacks.
6) The application notices the RPC call is done, and reuses the
pages to store something else (e.g. a new write).
7) The client NIC drains the TCP socket send buffer. Since the
page data has now changed, it reads a corrupted version of the
initial RPC call, and puts it on the wire.
This patch fixes the problem in the following manner:
The ordering guarantees of TCP ensure that when the server sends a
reply, then we know that the \_first\_ transmission has completed. Using
zero-copy in that situation is therefore safe.
If a time out occurs, we then send the retransmission using sendmsg()
(i.e. no zero-copy), We then know that the socket contains a full copy of
the data, and so it will retransmit a faithful reproduction even if the
RPC call completes, and the application reuses the O\_DIRECT buffer in
the meantime.

This causes a crash if we simulate disk allocation failure and run
less -f /dev/loop0 because the negative number is interpreted as a pointer:

loop: fix crash if blk\_alloc\_queue fails
commit 3ec981e30fae1f3c8728a05c730acaa1f627bcfb upstream.
loop: fix crash if blk\_alloc\_queue fails
If blk\_alloc\_queue fails, loop\_add cleans up, but it doesn't clean up the
identifier allocated with idr\_alloc. That causes crash on module unload in
idr\_for\_each(&loop\_index\_idr, &loop\_exit\_cb, NULL); where we attempt to
remove non-existed device with that id.

RIP [] blk\_requeue\_request+0x94/0xa0
RSP
The RIP is this line:
BUG\_ON(blk\_queued\_rq(rq));
After digging through the code, I think there may be a race between the
request completion and the timer handler running.
A timer is started for each request put on the device's queue (see
blk\_start\_request->blk\_add\_timer). If the request does not complete
before the timer expires, the timer handler (blk\_rq\_timed\_out\_timer)
will mark the request complete atomically:
static inline int blk\_mark\_rq\_complete(struct request \*rq)
{
return test\_and\_set\_bit(REQ\_ATOM\_COMPLETE, &rq->atomic\_flags);
}
and then call blk\_rq\_timed\_out. The latter function will call
scsi\_times\_out, which will return one of BLK\_EH\_HANDLED,
BLK\_EH\_RESET\_TIMER or BLK\_EH\_NOT\_HANDLED. If BLK\_EH\_RESET\_TIMER is
returned, blk\_clear\_rq\_complete is called, and blk\_add\_timer is again
called to simply wait longer for the request to complete.
Now, if the request happens to complete while this is going on, what
happens? Given that we know the completion handler will bail if it
finds the REQ\_ATOM\_COMPLETE bit set, we need to focus on the completion
handler running after that bit is cleared. So, from the above
paragraph, after the call to blk\_clear\_rq\_complete. If the completion
sets REQ\_ATOM\_COMPLETE before the BUG\_ON in blk\_add\_timer, we go boom
there (I haven't seen this in the cores). Next, if we get the
completion before the call to list\_add\_tail, then the timer will
eventually fire for an old req, which may either be freed or reallocated
(there is evidence that this might be the case). Finally, if the
completion comes in \*after\* the addition to the timeout list, I think
it's harmless. The request will be removed from the timeout list,
req\_atom\_complete will be set, and all will be well.
This will only actually explain the coredumps \*IF\* the request
structure was freed, reallocated \*and\* queued before the error handler
thread had a chance to process it. That is possible, but it may make
sense to keep digging for another race. I think that if this is what
was happening, we would see other instances of this problem showing up
as null pointer or garbage pointer dereferences, for example when the
request structure was not re-used. It looks like we actually do run
into that situation in other reports.
This patch moves the BUG\_ON(test\_bit(REQ\_ATOM\_COMPLETE,
&req->atomic\_flags)); from blk\_add\_timer to the only caller that could
trip over it (blk\_start\_request). It then inverts the calls to
blk\_clear\_rq\_complete and blk\_add\_timer in blk\_rq\_timed\_out to address
the race. I've boot tested this patch, but nothing more.

x86/apic: Disable I/O APIC before shutdown of the local APIC

In reboot and crash path, when we shut down the local APIC, the I/O APIC is
still active. This may cause issues because external interrupts
can still come in and disturb the local APIC during shutdown process.
To quiet external interrupts, disable I/O APIC before shutdown local APIC.

mtd: m25p80: fix allocation size
commit 778d226a1462572b51d6777cdb1d611543410cb4 upstream.
This patch fixes two memory errors:
1. During a probe failure (in mtd\_device\_parse\_register?) the command
buffer would not be freed.
2. The command buffer's size is determined based on the 'fast\_read'
boolean, but the assignment of fast\_read is made after this
allocation. Thus, the buffer may be allocated "too small".
To fix the first, just switch to the devres version of kzalloc.
To fix the second, increase MAX\_CMD\_SIZE unconditionally. It's not worth
saving a byte to fiddle around with the conditions here.
This problem was reported by Yuhang Wang a while back.

mtd: map: fixed bug in 64-bit systems
commit a4d62babf988fe5dfde24437fa135ef147bc7aa0 upstream.
Hardware:
CPU: XLP832,the 64-bit OS
NOR Flash:S29GL128S 128M
Software:
Kernel:2.6.32.41
Filesystem:JFFS2
When writing files, errors appear:
Write len 182 but return retlen 180
Write of 182 bytes at 0x072c815c failed. returned -5, retlen 180
Write len 186 but return retlen 184
Write of 186 bytes at 0x072caff4 failed. returned -5, retlen 184
These errors exist only in 64-bit systems,not in 32-bit systems. After analysis, we
found that the left shift operation is wrong in map\_word\_load\_partial. For instance:
unsigned char buf[3] ={0x9e,0x3a,0xea};
map\_bankwidth(map) is 4;
for (i=0; i < 3; i++) {
int bitpos;
bitpos = (map\_bankwidth(map)-1-i)\*8;
orig.x[0] &= ~(0xff << bitpos);
orig.x[0] |= buf[i] << bitpos;
}
The value of orig.x[0] is expected to be 0x9e3aeaff, but in this situation(64-bit
System) we'll get the wrong value of 0xffffffff9e3aeaff due to the 64-bit sign
extension:
buf[i] is defined as "unsigned char" and the left-shift operation will convert it
to the type of "signed int", so when left-shift buf[i] by 24 bits, the final result
will get the wrong value: 0xffffffff9e3aeaff.
If the left-shift bits are less than 24, then sign extension will not occur. Whereas
the bankwidth of the nor flash we used is 4, therefore this BUG emerges.

mtd: nand: hack ONFI for non-power-of-2 dimensions
commit 4355b70cf48363c50a9de450b01178c83aba8f6a upstream.
Some bright specification writers decided to write this in the ONFI spec
(from ONFI 3.0, Section 3.1):
"The number of blocks and number of pages per block is not required to
be a power of two. In the case where one of these values is not a
power of two, the corresponding address shall be rounded to an
integral number of bits such that it addresses a range up to the
subsequent power of two value. The host shall not access upper
addresses in a range that is shown as not supported."
This breaks every assumption MTD makes about NAND block/chip-size
dimensions -- they \*must\* be a power of two!
And of course, an enterprising manufacturer has made use of this lovely
freedom. Exhibit A: Micron MT29F32G08CBADAWP
"- Plane size: 2 planes x 1064 blocks per plane

PM / hibernate: Avoid overflow in hibernate\_preallocate\_memory()
commit fd432b9f8c7c88428a4635b9f5a9c6e174df6e36 upstream.
When system has a lot of highmem (e.g. 16GiB using a 32 bits kernel),
the code to calculate how much memory we need to preallocate in
normal zone may cause overflow. As Leon has analysed:
It looks that during computing 'alloc' variable there is overflow:
alloc = (3943404 - 1970542) - 1978280 = -5418 (signed)
And this function goes to err\_out.
Fix this by avoiding that overflow.

audit: use nlmsg\_len() to get message payload length
commit 4d8fe7376a12bf4524783dd95cbc00f1fece6232 upstream.
Using the nlmsg\_len member of the netlink header to test if the message
is valid is wrong as it includes the size of the netlink header itself.
Thereby allowing to send short netlink messages that pass those checks.
Use nlmsg\_len() instead to test for the right message length. The result
of nlmsg\_len() is guaranteed to be non-negative as the netlink message
already passed the checks of nlmsg\_ok().
Also switch to min\_t() to please checkpatch.pl.

audit: printk USER\_AVC messages when audit isn't enabled
commit 0868a5e150bc4c47e7a003367cd755811eb41e0b upstream.
When the audit=1 kernel parameter is absent and auditd is not running,
AUDIT\_USER\_AVC messages are being silently discarded.
AUDIT\_USER\_AVC messages should be sent to userspace using printk(), as
mentioned in the commit message of 4a4cd633 ("AUDIT: Optimise the
audit-disabled case for discarding user messages").
When audit\_enabled is 0, audit\_receive\_msg() discards all user messages
except for AUDIT\_USER\_AVC messages. However, audit\_log\_common\_recv\_msg()
refuses to allocate an audit\_buffer if audit\_enabled is 0. The fix is to
special case AUDIT\_USER\_AVC messages in both functions.
It looks like commit 50397bd1 ("[AUDIT] clean up audit\_receive\_msg()")
introduced this bug.

crypto: s390 - Fix aes-cbc IV corruption
commit f262f0f5cad0c9eca61d1d383e3b67b57dcbe5ea upstream.
The cbc-aes-s390 algorithm incorrectly places the IV in the tfm
data structure. As the tfm is shared between multiple threads,
this introduces a possibility of data corruption.
This patch fixes this by moving the parameter block containing
the IV and key onto the stack (the block is 48 bytes long).
The same bug exists elsewhere in the s390 crypto system and they
will be fixed in subsequent patches.

KVM: IOMMU: hva align mapping page size
commit 27ef63c7e97d1e5dddd85051c03f8d44cc887f34 upstream.
When determining the page size we could use to map with the IOMMU, the
page size should also be aligned with the hva, not just the gfn. The
gfn may not reflect the real alignment within the hugetlbfs file.
Most of the time, this works fine. However, if the hugetlbfs file is
backed by non-contiguous huge pages, a multi-huge page memslot starts at
an unaligned offset within the hugetlbfs file, and the gfn is aligned
with respect to the huge page size, kvm\_host\_page\_size() will return the
huge page size and we will use that to map with the IOMMU.
When we later unpin that same memslot, the IOMMU returns the unmap size
as the huge page size, and we happily unpin that many pfns in
monotonically increasing order, not realizing we are spanning
non-contiguous huge pages and partially unpin the wrong huge page.
Ensure the IOMMU mapping page size is aligned with the hva corresponding
to the gfn, which does reflect the alignment within the hugetlbfs file.

dm mpath: fix race condition between multipath\_dtr and pg\_init\_done
commit 954a73d5d3073df2231820c718fdd2f18b0fe4c9 upstream.
Whenever multipath\_dtr() is happening we must prevent queueing any
further path activation work. Implement this by adding a new
'pg\_init\_disabled' flag to the multipath structure that denotes future
path activation work should be skipped if it is set. By disabling
pg\_init and then re-enabling in flush\_multipath\_work() we also avoid the
potential for pg\_init to be initiated while suspending an mpath device.
Without this patch a race condition exists that may result in a kernel
panic:
1) If after pg\_init\_done() decrements pg\_init\_in\_progress to 0, a call
to wait\_for\_pg\_init\_completion() assumes there are no more pending path
management commands.
2) If pg\_init\_required is set by pg\_init\_done(), due to retryable
mode\_select errors, then process\_queued\_ios() will again queue the
path activation work.
3) If free\_multipath() completes before activate\_path() work is called a
NULL pointer dereference like the following can be seen when
accessing members of the recently destructed multipath:
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000090

dm: allocate buffer for messages with small number of arguments using GFP\_NOIO
commit f36afb3957353d2529cb2b00f78fdccd14fc5e9c upstream.
dm-mpath and dm-thin must process messages even if some device is
suspended, so we allocate argv buffer with GFP\_NOIO. These messages have
a small fixed number of arguments.
On the other hand, dm-switch needs to process bulk data using messages
so excessive use of GFP\_NOIO could cause trouble.
The patch also lowers the default number of arguments from 64 to 8, so
that there is smaller load on GFP\_NOIO allocations.

The reason is that current detection code doesn't follow AHCI spec:
First,the port multiplier detection process look like this:
ahci\_hardreset(link, class, deadline)
if (class == ATA\_DEV\_PMP) {
sata\_pmp\_attach(dev) /\* will enable FBS \*/
sata\_pmp\_init\_links(ap, nr\_ports);
ata\_for\_each\_link(link, ap, EDGE) {
sata\_std\_hardreset(link, class, deadline);
if (link\_is\_online) /\* do soft reset \*/
ahci\_softreset(link, class, deadline);
}
}
But, according to chapter 9.3.9 in AHCI spec: Prior to issuing software
reset, software shall clear PxCMD.ST to '0' and then clear PxFBS.EN to
'0'.
The patch test ok with kernel 3.11.1.
tj: Patch white space contaminated, applied manually with trivial
updates.

6.0 Gbps link speed was not decoded properly:
speed was reported at 3.0 Gbps only.
Tested: On a machine where libata reports 6.0 Gbps in

alarmtimer: return EINVAL instead of ENOTSUPP if rtcdev doesn't exist
commit 98d6f4dd84a134d942827584a3c5f67ffd8ec35f upstream.
Fedora Ruby maintainer reported latest Ruby doesn't work on Fedora Rawhide
on ARM. (http://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9008)
Because of, commit 1c6b39ad3f (alarmtimers: Return -ENOTSUPP if no
RTC device is present) intruduced to return ENOTSUPP when
clock\_get{time,res} can't find a RTC device. However this is incorrect.
First, ENOTSUPP isn't exported to userland (ENOTSUP or EOPNOTSUP are the
closest userland equivlents).
Second, Posix and Linux man pages agree that clock\_gettime and
clock\_getres should return EINVAL if clk\_id argument is invalid.
While the arugment that the clockid is valid, but just not supported
on this hardware could be made, this is just a technicality that
doesn't help userspace applicaitons, and only complicates error
handling.
Thus, this patch changes the code to use EINVAL.

usb: hub: Clear Port Reset Change during init/resume
commit e92aee330837e4911553761490a8fb843f2053a6 upstream.
This patch adds the Port Reset Change flag to the set of bits that are
preemptively cleared on init/resume of a hub. In theory this bit should
never be set unexpectedly... in practice it can still happen if BIOS,
SMM or ACPI code plays around with USB devices without cleaning up
correctly. This is especially dangerous for XHCI root hubs, which don't
generate any more Port Status Change Events until all change bits are
cleared, so this is a good precaution to have (similar to how it's
already done for the Warm Port Reset Change flag).

usb: Disable USB 2.0 Link PM before device reset.
commit dcc01c0864823f91c3bf3ffca6613e2351702b87 upstream.
Before the USB core resets a device, we need to disable the L1 timeout
for the roothub, if USB 2.0 Link PM is enabled. Otherwise the port may
transition into L1 in between descriptor fetches, before we know if the
USB device descriptors changed. LPM will be re-enabled after the
full device descriptors are fetched, and we can confirm the device still
supports USB 2.0 LPM after the reset.
We don't need to wait for the USB device to exit L1 before resetting the
device, since the xHCI roothub port diagrams show a transition to the
Reset state from any of the Ux states (see Figure 34 in the 2012-08-14
xHCI specification update).
This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, that contain
the commit 65580b4321eb36f16ae8b5987bfa1bb948fc5112 "xHCI: set USB2

selinux: correct locking in selinux\_netlbl\_socket\_connect)
commit 42d64e1add3a1ce8a787116036163b8724362145 upstream.
The SELinux/NetLabel glue code has a locking bug that affects systems
with NetLabel enabled, see the kernel error message below. This patch
corrects this problem by converting the bottom half socket lock to a
more conventional, and correct for this call-path, lock\_sock() call.

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-239-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-239.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-239.55)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the

implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. ([CVE-2013-6382](/security/CVE-2013-6382))

mpd reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

system calls in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7263](/security/CVE-2013-7263))

mpb reported an information leak in the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (l2tp)

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7264](/security/CVE-2013-7264))

mpb reported an information leak in the Phone Network protocol (phonet) in

the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7265](/security/CVE-2013-7265))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7266](/security/CVE-2013-7266))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local

user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information

from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7267](/security/CVE-2013-7267))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](/security/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](/security/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](/security/CVE-2013-7270))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](/security/CVE-2013-7271))

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area

Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-37-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-37.53~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-37.53~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
