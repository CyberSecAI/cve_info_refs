Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is related to CVE-2013-6837:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `jquery.prettyPhoto.js` file of the "WP-Pretty Photo" WordPress plugin. The vulnerability arises because user-supplied input from the URL's hash is not properly sanitized before being used to manipulate the DOM, specifically in the line  `$("a[rel^='" + hashRel + "']:eq(" + hashIndex + ")").trigger('click');`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability occurs entirely on the client-side, within the JavaScript code. The user-controlled data within the URL's hash fragment is directly used to construct a jQuery selector that modifies the page's DOM structure, without proper sanitization.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `getHashtag()` function extracts the value after `#!` from the URL, but doesn't sanitize it.
- **Dangerous Sink:** The jQuery `$("a[rel^='" + hashRel + "']:eq(" + hashIndex + ")").trigger('click');` line is a dangerous sink because it takes unsanitized user input (`hashRel`) and uses it to directly modify the DOM, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution if the input contains malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL's hash fragment. When a user visits the crafted URL, the vulnerable JavaScript code will execute this injected script within the user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking/Data Theft:** By executing arbitrary JavaScript code, an attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- **Malicious Redirects:** The attacker could redirect users to a malicious website.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the website's appearance or functionality.
- **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker could use the vulnerability to display fake login forms or other phishing content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the hash fragment (`#!`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Generate Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that contains the XSS payload within the hash.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious link for the XSS to execute. This could be achieved through phishing emails, social media, or other means.
- **No Server-Side Interaction Required:** Since the vulnerability is DOM-based, no direct interaction with the server is needed. This bypasses server-side security measures.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable code was identified in `jquery.prettyPhoto.js` at line 79.
- The vulnerability is triggered by including `#!` in the URL followed by the malicious payload.
- The vulnerability affects versions of prettyPhoto plugin prior to 3.1.6
- The fix includes sanitizing the `hashRel` input using `hashRel.replace(/([ #;&,.+\*~\':"!^$[\]()=>|\/])/g,'\\$1');`
