Root cause of vulnerability:
RPM writes file contents to the target installation directory under a temporary name, and verifies its cryptographic signature only after the temporary file has been written completely.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Race condition:  System interprets the unverified temporary file contents and extracts commands from it, creating a race window before signature validation
- Insufficient Verification:  Cryptographic signature check is done after file is written.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can modify signed RPM files to execute code chosen by them during package installation. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

Attack vectors:
- By modifying signed RPM files.
- Enticing a user to install a malicious rpm file

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to modify RPM files
- Ability to deliver the malicious RPM file to a target user
