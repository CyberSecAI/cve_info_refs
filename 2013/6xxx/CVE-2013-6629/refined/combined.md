## Details

Ben Turner, Bobby Holley, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler and Christoph

Diehl discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5609](/security/CVE-2013-5609), [CVE-2013-5610](/security/CVE-2013-5610))

Myk Melez discovered that the doorhanger notification for web app

installation could persist between page navigations. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2013-5611](/security/CVE-2013-5611))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that pages with missing character set encoding

information can inherit character encodings across navigations from

another domain. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct

cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2013-5612](/security/CVE-2013-5612))

Daniel Veditz discovered that a sandboxed iframe could use an object

element to bypass its own restrictions. ([CVE-2013-5614](/security/CVE-2013-5614))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free in

event listeners. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5616](/security/CVE-2013-5616))

A use-after-free was discovered in the table editing interface. An

attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5618](/security/CVE-2013-5618))

Dan Gohman discovered that binary search algorithms in Spidermonkey

used arithmetic prone to overflow in several places. However, this

is issue not believed to be exploitable. ([CVE-2013-5619](/security/CVE-2013-5619))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a crash when inserting

an ordered list in to a document using script. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-6671](/security/CVE-2013-6671))

Vincent Lefevre discovered that web content could access clipboard data

under certain circumstances, resulting in information disclosure.

([CVE-2013-6672](/security/CVE-2013-6672))

Sijie Xia discovered that trust settings for built-in EV root certificates

were ignored under certain circumstances, removing the ability for a user

to manually untrust certificates from specific authorities.

([CVE-2013-6673](/security/CVE-2013-6673))

Tyson Smith, Jesse Schwartzentruber and Atte Kettunen discovered a

use-after-free in functions for synthetic mouse movement handling. An

attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5613](/security/CVE-2013-5613))

Eric Faust discovered that GetElementIC typed array stubs can be generated

outside observed typesets. An attacker could possibly exploit this to

cause undefined behaviour with a potential security impact.

([CVE-2013-5615](/security/CVE-2013-5615))

Michal Zalewski discovered several issues with JPEG image handling. An

attacker could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information.

([CVE-2013-6629](/security/CVE-2013-6629), [CVE-2013-6630](/security/CVE-2013-6630))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-12-20 18:02:47 UTC  ``` libpng 1.6.8 was released [1] and notes the following fix:  Handle zero-length PLTE chunk or NULL palette with png_error() instead of png_chunk_report(), which by default issues a warning rather than an error, leading to later reading from a NULL pointer (png_ptr->palette) in png_do_expand_palette(). This is [CVE-2013-6954](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-6954) and VU#650142.  The git commit to fix is available [3].

Then memory is malloced for png_ptr->palette structure at:   477    png_ptr->palette = (png_colorp)png_calloc(png_ptr,  478       PNG_MAX_PALETTE_LENGTH * png_sizeof(png_color));  This mallocs 256 * 3 bytes of memory into png_ptr->palette structure, Later at:    479    png_memcpy(png_ptr->palette, palette, num_palette * png_sizeof(png_color));  Here zero bytes are copied into png_ptr->palette because num_palette = 0, so this memcpy looks like:  png_memcpy(png_ptr->palette, palette, 0)  So png_ptr->palette is filled with 256 * 3 zeros, (due to calloc)  Later when this structure is references in png_do_expand_palette(), the output is zero and there is no crash.   libpng 1.6: ===========  Here in png_set_PLTE() there is a check for num_palette = 0 at:   523    if ((num_palette > 0 && palette == NULL) ||  524       (num_palette == 0  525 #        ifdef PNG_MNG_FEATURES_SUPPORTED  526             && (png_ptr->mng_features_permitted & PNG_FLAG_MNG_EMPTY_PLTE) == 0  527 #        endif  528       ))  529    {  530       png_chunk_report(png_ptr, "Invalid palette", PNG_CHUNK_ERROR);  531       return;  532    }  So when num_palette is zero, a warning is printed and the function exits, However no memory is malloced for the  png_ptr->palette structure, and its pointing to zero.  Later when its referenced in png_do_expand_palette(), there is a null pointer deref and it crashes.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-17 09:30:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0413 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0413.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-17 09:33:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0412 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0412.html>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c27)  Stefan Cornelius    2014-04-17 10:27:23 UTC  ``` OpenJDK upstream commit: <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/rev/df3f9871ee6f>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-17 11:42:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0414 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0414.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-05-13 19:48:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0486 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0486.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-05-15 17:29:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0508 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0508.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c31)  Tomas Hoger    2014-06-09 09:07:33 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1106391](show_bug.cgi?id=1106391 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2014-2405 OpenJDK: libpng unhandled zero-length PLTE chunk or NULL palette (AWT, 8031352)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-06-10 13:12:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2014:0705 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0705.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1045561#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-07-29 15:41:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.4   Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.5   Red Hat Satellite Server v 5.6  Via RHSA-2014:0982 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0982.html>   ``` |  |

# libjpeg-turbo: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201606-03**

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in libjpeg-turbo, the
worse of which could allow remote attackers access to sensitive
information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libjpeg-turbo** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.2** |

### Background

libjpeg-turbo is a MMX, SSE, and SSE2 SIMD accelerated JPEG library

### Description

libjpeg-turbo does not check for certain duplications of component data
during the reading of segments that follow Start Of Scan (SOS) JPEG
markers.

### Impact

Remote attackers could obtain sensitive information from uninitialized
memory locations via a crafted JPEG images.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libjpeg-turbo users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libjpeg-turbo-1.4.2"

```

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1803)

## Topic

Updated libjpeg-turbo packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libjpeg-turbo package contains a library of functions for manipulating
JPEG images. It also contains simple client programs for accessing the
libjpeg functions.

An uninitialized memory read issue was found in the way libjpeg-turbo
decoded images with missing Start Of Scan (SOS) JPEG markers or Define
Huffman Table (DHT) JPEG markers. A remote attacker could create a
specially crafted JPEG image that, when decoded, could possibly lead to a
disclosure of potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-6629,
CVE-2013-6630)

All libjpeg-turbo users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Synopsis

Moderate: libjpeg security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1804)

## Topic

An updated libjpeg package that fixes one security issue is now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The libjpeg package contains a library of functions for manipulating JPEG
images. It also contains simple client programs for accessing the
libjpeg functions.

An uninitialized memory read issue was found in the way libjpeg decoded
images with missing Start Of Scan (SOS) JPEG markers. A remote attacker

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=11658#c0)  David Walser    2013-11-12 19:39:37 CET  ``` The latest Chromium browser update announcement [1] lists two read of uninitialized memory security issues that they have fixed in libjpeg-turbo.  Specific details about these vulnerabilities were made available today on the full-disclosure mailing list [2], including PoCs.  [1] <http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2013/11/stable-channel-update.html> [2] <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.full-disclosure/90919>  Reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: ```  David Walser    2013-11-12 19:39:43 CET   Whiteboard: (none) => MGA3TOO, MGA2TOO  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=11658#c1)  David Walser    2013-11-12 20:20:17 CET  ``` Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 2, Mageia 3, and Cauldron.  For those interested, the one patch has two hunks, the first of which fixes CVE-2013-6629 and the second of which fixes CVE-2013-6630.  Note to QA, see the full-disclosure list reference for PoC information.  Advisory: ========================  Updated libjpeg packages fix security vulnerabilities:  libjpeg 6b and libjpeg-turbo will use uninitialized memory when decoding images with missing SOS data for the luminance component (Y) in presence of valid chroma data (Cr, Cb) (CVE-2013-6629).  libjpeg-turbo will use uninitialized memory when handling Huffman tables (CVE-2013-6630).

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 104 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1618213.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1618213.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 37 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 35 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=686980#c0)  Jack Moffitt    2003-07-31 08:56:39 UTC  ``` The attached customer file has stripes when viewed with the display device or with tiff24nc.  I have reproduced with CVS HEAD with the following commandlines: gs 64_agony_lay.pdf gs -sDEVICE=tiff24nc -r180 -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sOutputFile=test.tiff 64_agony_lay.pdf ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=686980#c1)  Jack Moffitt    2003-07-31 08:57:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 242](attachment.cgi?id=242) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=242&action=edit) 64_agony_lay.pdf ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=686980#c2)  Alex Cherepanov    2004-05-11 12:23:22 UTC  ``` This problem was introduced with the new JPEG library, v.6b . Before we figure out how to fix it the customer can downgrade to the v.6a , which compiles without any changed in the latest versions.  ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=686980#c3)  Raph Levien    2004-06-17 12:56:33 UTC  ``` Additional testing notes: GS HEAD renders correctly with jpeg6a statically linked, incorrectly with jpeg6b (Linux). xpdf segfaults. OSX Preview renders with similar artifacts. Test file appears to be an example of a transparency-flattened file from InDesign 2.  ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=686980#c4)  Raph Levien    2004-06-18 09:20:50 UTC  ``` Proposed patch to libjpeg posted here:  <http://www.ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-code-review/2004-June/004547.html>  The file is invalid, so this can't be considered a high priority patch. It will probably suffice to document it and make it available to users. Of course, it should go into the next release of libjpeg if there is one.  ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=686980#c5)  Ralph Giles    2005-01-24 19:33:28 UTC  ``` The archive url broke. See       <http://ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-code-review/2004-June/004579.html>  instead.  Dropping priority to correspond with the current triage scheme. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=686980#c6)  Ray Johnston    2005-03-18 15:12:15 UTC  ``` No longer a customer issue ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=686980#c7)  Raph Levien    2005-03-30 08:36:29 UTC  ``` Since this is an issue in libjpeg rather than Ghostscript, we are closing it here. A note has been added to  Issues.htm:  <http://ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-cvs/2005-March/005363.html>  Linux distributions in particular are encouraged to apply the patch to their system libjpeg packages. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1031749#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-18 17:02:02 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that libjpeg-turbo would use uninitialized memory when handling Huffman tables (an issue similar to [CVE-2013-6629](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-6629)).  An example proof of concept is also available [3].  This was reported and fixed initially in Google Chrome/Chromium; it does not appear to be fixed in upstream libjpeg-turbo yet.  A patch to the third party source in Chromium for libjpeg-turbo [4] however is available.  Interestingly, the report at [2] indicates that libjpeg does not appear to be affected and indicates that a "simple fix for this is to locate get_dht in jdmarker.c and make sure that the huffval[] table is zeroed before use" however looking at a diff of jdmarker.c in libjpeg vs libjpeg-turbo doesn't seem to back that up (as a result this needs to be checked a little more closely as this zeroing of the huffval[] table does look applicable to libjpeg as well).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Ben Turner, Bobby Holley, Jesse Ruderman and Christian Holler discovered

multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5609](/security/CVE-2013-5609))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free in

event listeners. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5616](/security/CVE-2013-5616))

A use-after-free was discovered in the table editing interface. An

attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5618](/security/CVE-2013-5618))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a crash when inserting

an ordered list in to a document using script. If a user had enabled

scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2013-6671](/security/CVE-2013-6671))

Sijie Xia discovered that trust settings for built-in EV root certificates

were ignored under certain circumstances, removing the ability for a user

to manually untrust certificates from specific authorities.

([CVE-2013-6673](/security/CVE-2013-6673))

Tyson Smith, Jesse Schwartzentruber and Atte Kettunen discovered a

use-after-free in functions for synthetic mouse movement handling. If a

user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5613](/security/CVE-2013-5613))

Eric Faust discovered that GetElementIC typed array stubs can be generated

outside observed typesets. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker

could possibly exploit this to cause undefined behaviour with a potential

security impact. ([CVE-2013-5615](/security/CVE-2013-5615))

Michal Zalewski discovered several issues with JPEG image handling. An

attacker could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information.

([CVE-2013-6629](/security/CVE-2013-6629), [CVE-2013-6630](/security/CVE-2013-6630))

[Component:](/describecomponents.cgi?product=Core&component=Graphics%3A%20ImageLib#Graphics%3A%20ImageLib)

Graphics: ImageLib
▾

Core :: Graphics: ImageLib
ImageLib decodes GIF, JPEG and PNG images, and provides the decoded data to the Compositor for display. If Firefox or Seamonkey can display an image when loaded separately from the page, ImageLib is working, and the actual imaging bug exists elsewhere within Firefox or Seamonkey.

Examples of appropriate bugs: PNG gAMA chunk ignored; Crashes on GIF w/corrupted frame(merr-01.gif); or PNGs and JPEGs aren't displayed on FreeBSD.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c0)• 12 years ago |

This page contains an alternating pattern of kitty.jpg (a legit hello kitty image) and 55.jpg, an image that is 'decoded' to what looks like uninitialized memory:
<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/jpeg_leak/>
In most browsers, reloading this page a couple of times eventually causes a distorted version of 'hello kitty' to appear in one of the 55.jpg squares. In Firefox, it's relatively difficult to hit that condition, but it still happens every now and then.
At the bare minimum, this + <canvas> seems like a way to steal images across domains, although I suspect that the memory may contain non-image stuff, too.
Safari & others are also affected.

We trigger the "bad Huffman code" warning in jdhuff.c; I assume it's related:
/\* With garbage input we may reach the sentinel value l = 17. \*/
if (l > 16) {
WARNMS(state->cinfo, JWRN\_HUFF\_BAD\_CODE);
return 0; /\* fake a zero as the safest result \*/
}

I think it's probbly not jdhuff.c; the file contains a SOS record for component 2 or 3, but not for component 1. A closer look at get\_sos() in jdmarker.c is probably a better starting point.
(Just started looking into it, take this with a grain of salt.)

Yeah, I think it's that. We have Cr and Cb (chroma), but not Y (luma). The library doesn't notice that and applies chroma info over uninitialized memory?

If it's happening in Safari, then it sounds like an issue that is endemic to libjpeg in general, not just -turbo. Can someone confirm that?

I see no indication that it's intentionally fixed, but there are some differences in the code that make it a bit hard to tell.
They do accept a slightly modified version (<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/jpeg_leak/55-jpeg9-variant.jpg>), but I didn't get any non-deterministic behavior. Didn't put a lot of effort into it because the use of jpeg8/jpeg9 seems to be minimal.
As for the reasons, I suspect that everybody is fuzzing for crashes and working from that. And IJG jpeg doesn't crash ;p

I'm afraid I might have another one that may be separate from the IJG issue above. It has a different SOS and it only seems to decode non-deterministically in Chrome, Firefox, and with djpeg from libjpeg-turbo when malloc() is tweaked to randomly memset the returned buffers:

I'll be OOO for three weeks, so just a quick update:
1) Chrome folks have a tentative fix that bans SOS markers with repeated component IDs. I am not 100% sure this is bulletproof - I'm not sure if there are earlier checks int he code that would prevent, for example, a two-component JPEG with non-repeated components 2 and 3, but not 1. Perhaps?
2) In addition to the SOS issue that appears to be shared by jpeg6b and libjpeg-turbo, there is also a separate issue in turbo that appears to be related to the DHT marker:
<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/jpeg_leak/turbo-dht.jpg>
Here's the non-error-causing parent from which it's derived:
<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/jpeg_leak/turbo-dht-orig.jpg>
Shift-reload a couple of times in Firefox to see the problem.

Thanks. Note by 'conservative' we meant it might be rated too highly and were similarly thinking that displaying garbage is not too harmful on its own.

The PoC allows cross-domain image theft.
Unless demonstrated otherwise, I would caution against assuming that it's just "garbage": images can be large, and browsers can be made to use and free lots of memory for very specific things, which often makes the distinction between "read arbitrary address" and "read a specific address" fairly insignificant.

This is a patch from [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak"). It does fix the SOS problem for me. Unsure how to proceed and who to have review this and if there are any upstream implications. Jeff?

I don't really understand the ramifications of this fully and haven't had enough time to dig into it, but since you're mentioning jdmarker.c, one difference in libjpeg-turbo relative to jpeg-6b is that libjpeg-turbo handles JPEG images with duplicate component IDs. Specifically, some commercial software generates CMYK/YCCK JPEG images in which the K component has the same ID as the first component (C or Y.) Such images are out of spec, but apparently Adobe Reader handles them without error, and SumatraPDF requested that we do likewise. The specific patch relative to jpeg-6b is as follows:
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
\*\*\* 323,333 \*\*\*\*

for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {

! for (ci = 0, compptr = cinfo->comp\_info; ci < cinfo->num\_components;
ci++, compptr++) {
! if (cc == compptr->component\_id)
goto id\_found;
}

INPUT\_BYTE(cinfo, cc, return FALSE);
INPUT\_BYTE(cinfo, c, return FALSE);

! ci < cinfo->num\_components && ci < MAX\_COMPS\_IN\_SCAN;
ci++, compptr++) {
! if (cc == compptr->component\_id && !cinfo->cur\_comp\_info[ci])
goto id\_found;
}
I don't think that the patch you're proposing affects the above, but I'd love it if someone could confirm that for me.

Hey all,
A simple fix for the DHT issue appears to be to make sure that huffval in jdmarker.c gets zeroed before use:
--- a/jdmarker.c

Hope this helps. I'd like to publish the test cases and the tool used to generate them, so if there is a desire to ship libjpeg-turbo and / or Firefox with the fixes ahead of the time, it would be good to make it happen very soon :-)

Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to fix the problem for me (OS X 10.8.4), I can still see the corruption in the browser. Your suggestion from [Comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak") does fix the problem for me, seemingly with or without the zeroing.

To be clear, there are two related info leak bugs. One is fixed by [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak") (<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/jpeg_leak/>), the other should be fixed by that last one (<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/jpeg_leak/turbo-dht.jpg>).

FYI, I will release proof-of-concept images and the associated fuzzer on Oct 31. It's probably good for Firefox to make progress toward shipping the fixes around that time.
DRC: It would probably be good to include the fixes upstream, too, even if just to avoid confusion.

I absolutely agree. I would ask that someone submit each fix separately into our SourceForge tracker along with a test case that demonstrates the issue outside of Mozilla. If that isn't possible, then please explain further. Honestly, I've been having trouble following much of this discussion thus far, so any explanation at this point is appreciated.

Review of [attachment 800490](/attachment.cgi?id=800490 "Ban  SOS with repeated components IDs") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=800490&action=edit "Ban  SOS with repeated components IDs") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=800490&action=diff "Ban  SOS with repeated components IDs") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=891693&attachment=800490):
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I don't see any issues with this, although I would love it if someone could explain exactly the mechanism by which this prevents a memory leak and why the existing code in libjpeg-turbo that handles duplicate component IDs doesn't also handle this.

Sorry to bug everyone about this, but it's been driving me nuts and is making it difficult for me to participate in this forum. I can't seem to figure out how to make Bugzilla "accept" my reviews. Despite having published a review on a couple of different bugs, it keeps e-mailing me and telling me I still need to review them. If there's a way to do what I'm trying to do, it is very non-obvious.

In the review view, there will be a list of flags below the navigation/comment/review area. It'll look like this:
milan: review ? jmuizelaar@mozilla.com
milan: review ? dcommander@users.sourceforge.net
For the review with your email on it, you should be able to change the "?" to " ", "-", or "+", depending on what you want to do ("clear", "review-", or "review+" in this case). Then hit "publish".

You didn't have "editbugs" permissions so I gave you that. I think without that large parts of bugzilla UI is turned off.

Just for the record, after several delays, Chrome is going to release the fixes on Nov 12. I will probably post an advisory around that time.

Ban SOS with repeated components IDs
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The PoC allows cross-domain image theft.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This is a libjpeg change. The patch is trivial to port, but anything in libjpeg effects a lot, so from that point of view, there is risk.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely, but if anything, it would be false positives, where an image is tagged as invalid, but it's actually valid. Or, that the invalid images are used already:
"... some commercial software generates CMYK/YCCK JPEG images in which the K component has the same ID as the first component (C or Y.) Such images are out of spec, but apparently Adobe Reader handles them without error, and SumatraPDF requested that we do likewise..."

Ban SOS with repeated components IDs
sec-approval+ for trunk.
You should probably create and nominate Aurora, Beta, and ESR24 patches since this is a sec-high and a tiny patch.

OK, I really need an executive roll-up on this bug, because I'm having difficulty understanding how banning repeated component ID's solves the issue of handling JPEGs that have no SOS for the Y component. Was not the original issue that libjpeg assumes that images always have a Y SOS?

| [Comment 40](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c40)• 11 years ago |
|  | |

I think that there are other locations that enforce 1 or 3 components, and an earlier check that requires component IDs to be within that range.
So, AFAICT, BW images can only have a single component in SOS and the ID must be 1. RGB images need to have three components in SOS and the IDs must be some combination of 1, 2, and 3.
Because of this, the only way to trigger the bug is to have duplicate components in an RGB image (e.g., 1-1-3, 2-3-3, etc) and backporting the duplicate-component check from jpeg9 is good enough, even though it's not an intuitive fix.

Checkin-needed for trunk only. While it's a tiny patch, it is jpeg, so I would like it on trunk alone for a couple of days.Flags: needinfo?(jmuizelaar)Keywords: [checkin-needed](/buglist.cgi?keywords=checkin-needed&resolution=---)

Michal, can you comment on why you posted details of this bug to
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/83>
?? I thought the idea was to keep this under wraps until Mozilla agreed on a fix, so as not to encourage people to exploit it? Seems like posting it on an external site subverts the whole "secure bug" process.
I got blindsided by one of my users who stumbled upon the above post and was asking me why I hadn't checked in the fixes yet. Well, because I was waiting for someone to post the "approved" Mozilla patches upstream or at least give me a high sign that they were final. I assume that the repeated SOS issue is resolved, but I was never asked to review the DHT patch, so I don't know whether that issue was fully resolved yet or not.

DRC, in [comment 24](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak"), I noted that I'm aiming to release the details on October 4. In [comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c29 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak"), I moved this to October 31; and in [comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak"), I finally proposed November 12. I had no feedback on any of the proposed deadlines, so I proceeded with the plan.

I am not a Mozilla developer, but if I were, I would have expected that you would have waited until the fixes were integrated into Mozilla and this bug was made public. You can't just set your own arbitrary deadlines on a security patch. The purpose of keeping this private is to not encourage exploitation of the issue before a fix is available to end users.
Has the DHT issue also been fully resolved? It is unclear from reading the above comments.

DRC, it's generally a two-way street, i.e., developers ask for a reasonable advance notice, and researchers expect a timely resolution of the underlying issue. There is no single rule, but in general, very few people in the OSS community support indefinite secrecy for security bugs.

I didn't say indefinite, but the idea of making it private in the first place is so that an end user patch is available before the details of the bug are disclosed. That is, in case someone were to discover a way to exploit this, all a user would have to do to guard against the exploit is to update Firefox.
And you still are not answering my direct question regarding the DHT bug.

The patch landed in [comment 43](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c43 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak") applies cleanly all the way down to b2g18. Just need the approvals to land.

The DHT patch from [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak")
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The comment talks about "info leak", so it does identify that there is an issue.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
n/a
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This is a libjpeg change. The patch is trivial to port, but anything in libjpeg effects a lot, so from that point of view, there is risk.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely to cause a regression.

The DHT patch from [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak")
The fix for the info leak came in two parts. This is the second part, same reasoning for uplifting.

Please note that the DHT patch needs to be reformatted for spacing. The spacing in [Comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak") was correct, but it was changed for some reason before it got rolled into a patch.
Also note that these patches have been checked in upstream.

Sorry about that. I've attached a modified patch with the correct white space.

Couldn't verify the first issue because the right-hand images don't get loaded in builds with the fix ("The image cannot be displayed because it contains errors"). They get loaded every time in pre-fix builds.

Ioana, regarding the first image - try the same URL in Safari 6.0 for a comparison. Currently, Safari (for me) displays the cross-domain image as image data in the bad JPG, which is something we want to prevent.
I think that it is OK if the new behavior is to block the bad image.
To verify the fix, confirm that the image either a) doesn't load or b) loads, but does not display as it does in Safari.
If there are any doubts, let me know and I'll verify.

Failure to display the image is the correct behavior. The fix causes the library to reject images with duplicate component IDs.

Thanks for the details guys! I didn't compare Firefox with other browsers because Safari and Chrome were broken when I tried. IE does work fine here though. Anyway, given [comment 74](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c74 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak"), this bug is fixed on on the Ubuntu builds in [comment 72](/show_bug.cgi?id=891693#c72 "RESOLVED FIXED - JPEG info leak").
I also verified this fix on Windows 7 64bit and Mac OS X 10.9, on Firefox 26.0b10 and the 12/04 Aurora and Nightly.
I will only verify the fix on Firefox 24.2.0 ESR since the builds are not done yet.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2013/11/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, November 12, 2013

Chrome has been updated to 31.0.1650.48 for Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome Frame.

Flash Player has been [updated](http://helpx.adobe.com/en/flash-player/release-note/fp_119_air_39_release_notes.html) to 11.9.900.152, which is included w/ this release.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [25 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M31). Below, we highlight fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or particularly interesting. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank miaubiz and Atte Kettunen of OUSPG for working with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. $2000 in additional rewards were issued.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1031734#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-18 16:21:31 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that libjpeg and libjpeg-turbo would use uninitialized memory when decoding images with missing SOS data for the luminance component (Y) in the presence of valid chroma data (Cr, Cb).  An example proof of concept that can be viewed in a browser is also available [3].  This was reported and fixed initially in Google Chrome/Chromium; it does not appear to be fixed in upstream libjpeg or libjpeg-turbo yet.  Patches to the third party source in Chromium for libjpeg [4] and libjpeg-turbo [5] however are available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1031734#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-18 16:21:31 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that libjpeg and libjpeg-turbo would use uninitialized memory when decoding images with missing SOS data for the luminance component (Y) in the presence of valid chroma data (Cr, Cb).  An example proof of concept that can be viewed in a browser is also available [3].  This was reported and fixed initially in Google Chrome/Chromium; it does not appear to be fixed in upstream libjpeg or libjpeg-turbo yet.  Patches to the third party source in Chromium for libjpeg [4] and libjpeg-turbo [5] however are available.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Bulletin: InfoSphere Streams is possibly affected by vulnerabilities in the IBM® SDK, Java™ Technology Edition (CVE-2014-0453 and CVE-2014-0460)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The IBM® Developers Kit, Java™ Technology Edition that is shipped with InfoSphere Streams has security vulnerabilities two of which could potentially affect InfoSphere Streams. Other vulnerabilities could be exposed by the use of custom Java code in InfoSphere Streams applications. Customers are advised to evaluate the identified vulnerabilities along with their Java code and take appropriate action if these security exposures affect their systems.

## Vulnerability Details

IBM InfoSphere Streams bundles the IBM Developers Kit, Java Technology Edition (IBM Developer Kit, Java). The IBM Developer Kit, Java is based on the Oracle® Java Developer Kit(TM) for which Oracle has released the April 2014 critical patch updates (CPU). The April 2014 release contains security vulnerability fixes and the IBM Java SDK has been updated to incorporate those updates. See the Remediation/Fixes section below for information on upgrading your Streams installation(s) to protect against these vulnerabilities.

## Remediation/Fixes

Customers who are concerned about any of these vulnerabilities should apply the appropriate upgrade for their InfoSphere Streams installation as indicated below. Fix packs and patches are available on IBM Fix Central.

* **Version 3.2:** Apply upgrade to [3.2.1 or later](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Streams&release=3.2.1.0&platform=All&function=all&source=fc). If JAVA\_HOME is defined see the note at the end of this section.
* **Version 3.1**: Apply upgrade [3.1 fix pack 3 (3.1.0.3) or later](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Streams&release=3.1.0.2&platform=All&function=all&source=fc). If JAVA\_HOME is defined see the note at the end of this section.
* **Version 3.0:** Apply patch [3.0.0.0-Patch\_for\_IBM\_Java6\_SR16](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Streams&release=3.0.0.0&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=3.0.0.0-Patch_for_IBM_Java6_SR16&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc). If JAVA\_HOME is defined see the note at the end of this section.
* **Versions 1.0 and 2.0:** Upgrade to the latest version of InfoSphere Streams for which a Java fix has been released.
* For assistance performing an upgrade contact IBM Technical Support.
* Customers who cannot upgrade and need to secure their installation should open a PMR with IBM Technical Support and request assistance securing their InfoSphere Streams system against the vulnerabilities identified in the October 2013 Oracle Java CPU. IBM will assist in securing your installation against the Java vulnerabilities identified in your InfoSphere Steams applications.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If JAVA\_HOME is set ensure it points to the install location of the upgraded IBM Developer Kit, Java. Applications compiled with JAVA\_HOME set to a different location will need to be recompiled after JAVA\_HOME has been changed. For more information on compiling with JAVA\_HOME set see the *Notes* section on the page at this URL: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCRJU_3.2.1/com.ibm.swg.im.infosphere.streams.install-admin.doc/doc/ibminfospherestreams-install-prerequisites-java-supported-sdks.html?lang=en>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
