Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2013-6629:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an uninitialized memory read issue within the handling of JPEG image markers, specifically within libjpeg and libjpeg-turbo libraries. The issue occurs when decoding images with missing Start Of Scan (SOS) JPEG markers or Define Huffman Table (DHT) markers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Memory Read:** The core vulnerability is that the affected libraries read from uninitialized memory locations when decoding specifically crafted JPEG images, leading to information disclosure.
*   The vulnerability is present when the JPEG image lacks certain markers, like SOS for luminance (Y) component, or when there are duplications of component data, or with improperly configured Huffman tables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** A successful exploit could result in the disclosure of potentially sensitive information from the uninitialized memory.
*   **Cross-domain image theft:** Exploiting this vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to steal images across domains.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted JPEG Images:** The primary attack vector involves a remote attacker creating and delivering a specially crafted JPEG image to the vulnerable application (e.g. a web browser).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver the specially crafted JPEG image to a vulnerable application, typically through a website.
*   **No Authentication Required**: Exploitation doesn't require any form of authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how `libjpeg` and `libjpeg-turbo` handle JPEG images with missing or duplicated component data in the SOS markers, or when DHT markers are improperly formed. Specifically the `get_sos` and `get_dht` functions within `jdmarker.c` are implicated.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple products, including browsers (Firefox, Chrome), image libraries and other software utilizing the vulnerable `libjpeg` and `libjpeg-turbo` libraries
*   Fixes involve adding validation to check for the duplicate component IDs during the reading of SOS JPEG markers or zeroing out memory before use when processing DHT markers.
*   The issue is present in libjpeg 6b and later, as well as `libjpeg-turbo` versions <= 1.3.0.
*   Red Hat stated that this issue does not affect the version of libpng shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
*   Upstream acknowledges that only libpng 1.6.1 to 1.6.7 were affected by zero length PLTE issues
*   The vulnerability is present in various distributions of Linux and other operating systems, including macOS and iOS
