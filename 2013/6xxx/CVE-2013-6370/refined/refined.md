```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The printbuf APIs in json-c use integers (`int`) for buffer lengths, which is inappropriate for 32-bit architectures. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `size_t` is larger than `int`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow (CWE-119)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) by causing a buffer overflow, potentially leading to application crash or other unexpected behavior.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by providing crafted JSON data that triggers the overflow in the `printbuf` APIs.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send malicious JSON data to an application that uses the vulnerable `json-c` library."
