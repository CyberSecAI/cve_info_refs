      "cve_id": "CVE-2015-0273",
      "description": "Use after free vulnerability in php5: unserialize() with DateTimeZone",
      "root_cause": "The `convert_to_long()` function frees the ZVAL and its children from memory. However, `unserialize()` allows the use of `R:` or `r:` to set references to the already freed memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "By using `unserialize()` with crafted data that includes references to freed memory locations. Two specific examples are given: one that leaks memory and the other that crashes PHP."
         ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the unserialize function. The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerability to craft a malicious input."

      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-9652",
     "description": "php5,php53: out of bounds read in mconvert()",

      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-6501",
       "description": "php: predictable file name used for cache in world writeable directory",
      "root_cause": "The PHP WSDL extension uses a predictable filename in a world-writable directory as a cache. The filename is based on a configurable directory name, a prefix, and an MD5 hash of the file or URL.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Predictable file name",
        "Cache poisoning"
      ],
      "impact": "Local attacker can poison the WSDL cache by pre-creating a file with a malicious WSDL definition, allowing for redirection of web service endpoints and potential execution of remote code on the wrong server. This can lead to stealing argument values and injecting incorrect results.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "A local attacker can create a file with a predictable name in the /tmp directory to replace the legitimate cache file."
