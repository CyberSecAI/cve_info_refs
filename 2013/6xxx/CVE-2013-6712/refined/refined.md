Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6712:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer over-read within the `scan` function located in `ext/date/lib/parse_iso_intervals.c` of PHP. This function is responsible for parsing ISO interval specifications when creating `DateInterval` objects. The code doesn't properly restrict the size of the data being read, leading to the over-read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer over-read: The code reads beyond the allocated buffer in heap memory when handling specially crafted interval specifications.
- Lack of input validation: The vulnerability occurs due to improper restriction of the creation of `DateInterval` objects based on parsed input, which leads to parsing a string that is too long.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. By providing a maliciously crafted interval specification, an attacker can trigger the buffer over-read, causing the PHP interpreter to crash. 
- Potential Information Leak (retracted): Initially, there was a possibility of leaking heap memory, but this was later found to be incorrect because PHP generates a warning/exception if the error occurs, preventing the creation of an instance with leaked data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted interval specification to a PHP application using the DateInterval class. This can be done through various means, such as:
    - Web application inputs that use DateInterval
    - XML-RPC requests/responses
    - Any application taking user-supplied input that ends up using `DateInterval`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted interval specification to the vulnerable PHP application.
- The attacker's position depends on how the PHP application processes the interval specifications.  If the application parses user-supplied input directly with `DateInterval`, a remote attacker can exploit this.
- The attacker can be any user of a web application that makes use of the DateInterval class and allows to specify the interval.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability is confirmed to affect PHP versions 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5, including development branches of php-src at the time the vulnerability was discovered.
- Patches have been provided upstream in PHP versions 5.4.24 and 5.5.8 which fix the issue.
- Red Hat has issued security advisories (RHSA-2014:1012 and RHSA-2014:1765) to address this and other related vulnerabilities in php and php53 packages.
- Debian security advisory DSA-2816-1 addresses the vulnerability.
- Ubuntu USN-2055-1 also addresses the vulnerability.
- OpenSUSE has issued security updates to address the vulnerability, including openSUSE-SU-2013:1963-1 and openSUSE-SU-2013:1964-1.
- Apple has included a fix for the vulnerability in OS X Yosemite v10.10.3 and Security Update 2015-004, fixing affected versions.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `scan` function of `parse_iso_intervals.c` during parsing of date information.
