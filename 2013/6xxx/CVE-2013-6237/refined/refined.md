Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how ISL Light handles the clipboard during a remote sharing session. When a user hosting a session copies sensitive data (e.g., a password) to their local clipboard, the remote user can directly paste this data in clear text into any application. There is no mechanism to prevent the remote user from accessing the clipboard contents of the host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure clipboard sharing: The application transmits clipboard data from the host to the remote user without adequate security controls.
- Lack of access control: There is no option to disable the remote user's ability to read the host's clipboard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive data exposure: Remote users can gain access to sensitive information copied to the host's clipboard, such as passwords, confidential text, or other private data.
- Persistent data leak: The sensitive data remains in the remote user's clipboard even after the session ends.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote access: The vulnerability can be exploited by any remote user who is granted access to a sharing session hosted by a vulnerable ISL Light instance.
- Clipboard access: Once a remote user has access to the session, they can paste data from the host's clipboard into any application running on their side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a remote participant in an ISL Light session where the host is using the vulnerable version.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the host system; standard access as a remote user is sufficient.
