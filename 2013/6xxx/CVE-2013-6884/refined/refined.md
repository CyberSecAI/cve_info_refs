Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6884:

**CVE-2013-6884** relates to the use of hard-coded credentials in the Ditto Forensic FieldStation.

**Root Cause:**
The device has a default system user named 'ditto' with the default password 'ditto'. This user is allowed to elevate privileges to root using sudo without any additional authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hard-coded credentials:** The use of default, easily guessable credentials.
- **Unrestricted sudo access:** The default user 'ditto' can gain root privileges without further authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full system access:** An attacker can gain complete control over the Ditto device.
- **Data manipulation:** With root access, an attacker can modify, delete, or tamper with evidence data.
- **Malware deployment:** Attackers can persistently deploy malware on the device.
- **Compromise of forensic integrity:** The device can no longer be trusted for accurate and reliable forensic analysis.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely if the device is connected to a network accessible to the attacker.
- **Active SSH daemon:** The presence of an active SSH daemon on the device, combined with the default credentials, allows for remote exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network connectivity:** The attacker must be able to connect to the same or a reachable network as the vulnerable device.
- **Knowledge of default credentials:** The attacker needs to know or guess the username ('ditto') and password ('ditto').

**Additional Details:**
- The device is marketed as a secure forensic tool, which makes this vulnerability particularly damaging.
- The combination of the hardcoded credentials and the active SSH daemon significantly increases the attack surface and the ease of exploitation.
