- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Authentication bypass due to insufficient access control on the RuggedCom ROS-based web server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper access controls allow users with unprivileged accounts (guest or operator) to perform administrative operations over the network.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with low-privileged access can perform administrative functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification of settings, and disruption of service, or complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks through the web interface on port 443/TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have valid, low-privileged credentials (guest or operator) on the affected device.
