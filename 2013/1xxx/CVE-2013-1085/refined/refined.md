Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-1085

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Novell Messenger client for Windows due to the improper handling of specific commands passed via the `nim://` protocol handler. Specifically, a large filename parameter within an import command triggers the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:**  This is the core vulnerability, where a larger-than-expected input is written into a fixed-size buffer on the stack, overwriting adjacent memory locations.
*   **Improper input validation:** The application fails to properly validate the size of the filename parameter before processing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable workstation.
*   **Privilege escalation:** The code execution occurs in the context of the Administrator account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **User interaction required:** The target user must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file that contains a crafted `nim://` URL to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to create a malicious web page or file that contains a crafted `nim://` URL with a large filename parameter.
*   The attacker needs to entice the target user to interact with the malicious content.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Luigi Auriemma and reported through HP Enterprise Security's Zero Day Initiative.
*   The vulnerability affects Novell Messenger versions 2.2.1 and earlier, 2.1 and earlier, and GroupWise Messenger 2.04 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by upgrading to Novell Messenger client for Windows version 2.2.2 or higher.
* Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID `12481`.
