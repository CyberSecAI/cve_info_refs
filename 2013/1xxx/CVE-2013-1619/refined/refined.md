Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2013-1619:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a timing side-channel vulnerability in the GnuTLS library's implementation of TLS/SSL protocol when using CBC-mode cipher suites. The GnuTLS implementation of MEE-TLS-CBC deals with bad padding in a way that deviates from RFC recommendations. Specifically, instead of assuming a zero-length padding, GnuTLS uses the last byte of the plaintext to determine how many padding bytes to remove.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Timing Side-Channel:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the time it takes to process a TLS/SSL record with CBC-mode encryption can vary depending on the padding. This allows an attacker to potentially deduce information about the plaintext by analyzing the timing differences during decryption.
-   **Incorrect Padding Handling:** GnuTLS doesn't follow RFC guidelines for padding, making it susceptible to this timing attack.
-   **CBC-mode cipher suites:** The vulnerability exists in the way CBC padding is handled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Plaintext Recovery:** A remote attacker, positioned as a Man-in-the-Middle, can recover parts or all of the plaintext from TLS/SSL encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding oracle. This is achieved by analyzing the timing differences that occur when decrypting packets.
-   **Information Exposure**: The attacker can potentially get access to sensitive information transmitted via a vulnerable GnuTLS connection.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the communication between the client and the server.
-   **Timing Analysis**: The attacker leverages the small timing differences in the server response to infer the padding values.
-   **Repeated Connections (TLS):** For TLS, the attacker must repeatedly send similar data in the same position within multiple sessions. This is needed to generate enough information for the analysis.
-   **Single Session (DTLS):** For DTLS connections, the attack can be potentially carried out in a single session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be located close to the server or client to accurately measure timing differences over the network.
-   **Packet Interception:** The attacker needs to intercept and modify TLS/SSL communications between client and server.
-   **Ability to Trigger Errors**: For the attack to work the attacker needs to be able to force the client to reconnect and resend the same data.

**Additional Notes:**
-   This vulnerability is sometimes referred to as the "Lucky Thirteen" attack.
-   The issue is not specific to GnuTLS, but also affects other TLS/SSL implementations that do not adhere to the RFC guidelines for CBC padding (though details may vary in how vulnerable those other implementations are to the exploitation of such vulnerabilities).
-   The provided documents indicate that fixes for this vulnerability involve correct padding handling, and in some cases, disabling CBC ciphersuites.

The content from [www.gnutls.org](http://www.gnutls.org_23437b87_20250125_102356.html) provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, and it was discovered by Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson. It also references "proposed a new padding mechanism [proposed a new padding mechanism](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pironti-tls-length-hiding-00) which one of its targets is to eliminate that CBC padding issue (the other target is to allow arbitrary padding to any ciphersuite).
