      "text": "Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges.\n\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.\n\nAn attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability."
