Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-1052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from `pam-xdg-support` incorrectly handling the `PATH` environment variable. Specifically, it was calling `rm` without specifying an absolute path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure PATH Handling:** The PAM module did not sanitize or use absolute paths when executing `rm`, making it vulnerable to malicious modifications to the `PATH` environment variable.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability could be exploited in conjunction with `sudo`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could leverage the vulnerability to escalate privileges to that of an administrator.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By manipulating the PATH and having the vulnerable program execute a malicious rm, a attacker could execute code as a privileged user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **PATH Manipulation:** The attacker needs to modify the `PATH` environment variable to point to a malicious `rm` executable.
*   **sudo Usage:** The attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability in combination with `sudo`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have a shell account or be able to execute code locally on the target system.
*   **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how the `PATH` variable works and how to manipulate it.
*   **Ability to use sudo:** The attacker needs to be able to invoke commands using `sudo`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves using absolute paths when calling `rm` within the `pam-xdg-support` module.
*   The affected Ubuntu version is 12.10 (Quantal).
*   The vulnerable package is `pam-xdg-support`.
* The vulnerable code was patched in version `0.2-0ubuntu1.1`
