How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=922177#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-15 16:37:56 UTC  ``` A flaw in ptlib prior to 2.12.1 was fixed [1]; this prevents the "billion laughs" denial of service attack.  This attack is due to improper length checks/recursion detection during XML entity expansion.  If an attacker were able to provide as input a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity references, they could cause the application linked to ptlib (for example, Ekiga) to consume extreme amounts of CPU and memory.  [1] <http://opalvoip.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/opalvoip?view=revision&revision=28856>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=922177#c1)  Peter Robinson    2013-03-15 16:49:58 UTC  ``` Is this the same as RHBZ 883058?   If so the fix was back ported to ptlib 2.10.10   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=922177#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-03-15 17:07:20 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/03/15/7>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=922177#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-15 17:18:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=922177#c1)) > Is this the same as RHBZ 883058?  >  > If so the fix was back ported to ptlib 2.10.10  No, I don't believe so.  That issue is about not verifying UTF-8 prior to display leading to a crash.  This issue is about XML entity expansion and recursion, which doesn't lead to a crash but to excessive CPU/memory usage.  In [bug 883058#c6](show_bug.cgi?id=883058#c6 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-5621 ekiga: DoS (crash) after receiving call from other party with not UTF-8 valid name") it talks about the same commit, but I don't think that reference was correct, as the upstream gnome bug for [bug 883058](show_bug.cgi?id=883058 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-5621 ekiga: DoS (crash) after receiving call from other party with not UTF-8 valid name") referenced <https://git.gnome.org/browse/ekiga/commit/?id=7d09807257> as the fix, which is entirely different (ptlib/trunk/src/ptclib/pxml.cxx (this flaw) vs lib/engine/components/opal/opal-call.cpp (that bug)).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=922177#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-03-19 06:42:07 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect the version of ptlib as shipped with Fedora 17 and Fedora-18   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=922177#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-06-11 21:05:02 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2013-1864>   ``` |  |
