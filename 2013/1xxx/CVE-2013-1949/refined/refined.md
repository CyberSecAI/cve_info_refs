Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1949:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was caused by the intentional injection of malicious code into the Social Media Widget WordPress plugin by a contracted developer. This code fetches and executes code from a remote URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The plugin fetches content from `hxxp://i.aaur.net/i.php` and includes it in the generated page.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin does not validate the content it receives from the remote URL before including it in the page.
- **Trust in Third-Party Code:** The plugin author trusted a contracted developer to write code for the plugin without proper oversight or review.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the content at `hxxp://i.aaur.net/i.php`, an attacker could inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on vulnerable websites.
- **Spam Injection:** In this case, the injected code served to inject "Pay Day Loan" spam into websites using the plugin.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker who could perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the server could inject malicious code.
- **SEO Manipulation:** The injected spam links could negatively affect the SEO of affected websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Developer:** A malicious developer introduced the vulnerability.
- **Remote Server Compromise:**  If the server hosting `hxxp://i.aaur.net/i.php` were compromised, the attacker could control the injected code.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** MitM attacks could be used to redirect the request for the external file and inject malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Modify Plugin Code:** The attacker needed to be able to modify the plugin code, either directly, or by using compromised developer credentials.
- **Control Over Remote URL:** The attacker needed control over the server hosting `hxxp://i.aaur.net/i.php` to serve the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The injected code used `wp_remote_get` and `curl_init` to retrieve the remote content, and `echo` to include it in the page.
- The plugin was removed from the WordPress plugin repository but later restored after an update was issued.
- The vulnerability was present in versions 3.3 and 4.0 of the plugin.
-  The plugin author initially stated they were a marketing company and had hired a contract programmer to do development work.
-  WordPress core team did push an update to remove the malicious code from already existing sites.
