Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1729:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the NVIDIA graphics drivers on macOS, specifically when handling textures in WebGL. This flaw allows portions of the user's desktop or other visible applications to be incorporated into WebGL canvases.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is that the content of a WebGL texture can contain data from other applications or the desktop, exposing potentially sensitive information.
- **Inadequate Texture Size Handling:** The NVIDIA driver had a problem with large textures, leading to incorrect memory handling and the inclusion of data from outside the intended WebGL context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Personal Information:**  Exploitation could allow a malicious website to capture and potentially transmit personal data visible on the user's screen at the time (e.g., text, images, documents from other applications).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** A website with malicious JavaScript utilizing WebGL could trigger this vulnerability, causing the browser to incorporate unintended content into the WebGL texture.
- **Web Inspector Tool:** The vulnerability was initially discovered through the Firefox's web inspector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to lure a victim to a malicious website.
- The victim must be using Firefox on macOS with a vulnerable NVIDIA graphics driver.
- The attacker needs some knowledge of WebGL to construct the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Platforms:** The issue specifically affected macOS users with NVIDIA graphics cards, running macOS 10.8 or later. The issue was not observed with Intel graphics on macOS.
- **Texture Size Limit:** The vulnerability is triggered when creating textures with a size of 8192x8192 or larger. Textures smaller than this do not expose the issue. The fix included capping the texture size to 8191.
- **Resolution:** The fix was implemented in Firefox 24 and included limiting the maximum texture size to 8191 pixels.  A non-power-of-two limit (8191) was deemed acceptable. The fix was later backported to Firefox 23.
- **Severity:** The severity was initially considered "high," but was later downgraded to "moderate" because it only affected a subset of users (those with macOS and NVIDIA graphics).
