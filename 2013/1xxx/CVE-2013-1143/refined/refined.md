Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1143:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of a specific, but uncommon, traffic engineering PATH message by the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) feature in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. This occurs when the device has Multiprotocol Label Switching with Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The RSVP feature does not correctly process a specific type of traffic engineering PATH message.
*   **CWE-119:** This vulnerability is associated with CWE-119 which generally relates to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. Although this advisory does not provide specifics as to how it is exploited, it suggests that an input to the RSVP software is causing a memory corruption when processing a specific RSVP message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device. Repeated exploitation can lead to a sustained DoS condition, rendering the device unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without any prior authentication.
*   **Specific Traffic:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific type of traffic engineering PATH message directed at the device. Transit traffic will not trigger the vulnerability, only traffic destined for the device itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco device.
*   **Traffic Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft and send the specific, uncommon traffic engineering PATH message that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **MPLS-TE Requirement:** The affected device must have MPLS-TE enabled to be vulnerable.
*   **Configuration Command:** The presence of the `mpls traffic-eng tunnels` global configuration command indicates a vulnerable configuration.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 7.1 and a temporal score of 5.9.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no known workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has provided fixed software releases for affected Cisco IOS and IOS XE versions.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco devices running affected versions of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software with MPLS-TE enabled.
