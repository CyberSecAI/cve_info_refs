Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1793:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `openstack-db` script, part of the `openstack-utils` package, by default creates MySQL database users with passwords that are the same as the service name (e.g., "keystone", "glance", "cinder", "nova"). This default behavior makes the passwords easily guessable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Passwords:** The script uses predictable passwords, equal to the service name by default, for database users created for various OpenStack services.
*   **Lack of Enforcement:** While the script does have an option (`--password` or `-p`) to set a custom password, it doesn't require its use and instead defaults to insecure passwords if no option is provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** An attacker who knows the predictable passwords could gain unauthorized access to the OpenStack service databases.
*   **Data Breach:** If successful, an attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data within these databases, leading to a potential breach of the OpenStack environment.
*   **Service Disruption:** An attacker could also potentially disrupt services by manipulating the data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to MySQL:** The attacker would need to be able to connect to the MySQL database instance which is often accessible via the network, depending on configurations.
*   **Password Guessing:**  The attacker needs to know or guess the default password values which are the service names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the MySQL server to attempt a connection.
*   **Knowledge of Default Behavior:** The attacker needs awareness of the default password creation behavior of the `openstack-db` script, that it uses the service names as the default password if the password is not explicitly specified by the user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `openstack-db` script within the `openstack-utils` package.
*   The script creates database users for services like "keystone", "glance", "cinder", and "nova".
*   The issue is documented, but the behavior was not changed (marked as `CLOSED WONTFIX`).
*   The script is primarily intended for developers.
*   The suggested fixes include forcing the use of the `--password` option, prompting for a password if none is entered, or generating a secure random password if one is not specified.
*   The use of command line arguments to specify the password is not advised for production systems, due to the risk of passwords being stored in command history or visible in the process list.
