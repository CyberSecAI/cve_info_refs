Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1806:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in PHP-Fusion. Specifically, the `user_theme` parameter in `maincore.php` and the `enable` parameter in `administration/user_fields.php` are not properly sanitized, allowing for directory traversal and local file inclusion attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, caused by the lack of proper input sanitization for the `user_theme` and `enable` parameters.  This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.
    *   `maincore.php`: The `user_theme` parameter, when modified via user profile settings, is not sufficiently sanitized. An attacker can inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) and a null byte (`\0`) to include local files.
    *  `administration/user_fields.php`: The `enable` parameter, when used in a GET request, is also vulnerable to directory traversal and null byte injection, leading to LFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a specially crafted file (e.g., an uploaded image with PHP code embedded), an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including the ability to steal sensitive information, modify data, or establish a backdoor.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The LFI vulnerabilities can be leveraged to read sensitive files from the server, potentially exposing configurations, credentials, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The `user_theme` parameter is submitted via a POST request when a user updates their profile.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The `enable` parameter is exploited through a GET request to the `administration/user_fields.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** To exploit the vulnerability in `maincore.php`, the attacker needs a valid user account with the "Allow users to change theme" option enabled, which is default.
*   **Admin Privileges:** To exploit the vulnerability in `administration/user_fields.php`, the attacker needs admin access with user field administration privileges.
*   **PHP Version:** The exploitation of both LFI vulnerabilities relies on PHP versions earlier than 5.3.4 to utilize null byte injection.
*   **Knowledge of the file system**: To successfully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker needs to know or discover the path to an upload location where they can place their malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory `waraxe-2013-SA#097` lists multiple vulnerabilities, and this CVE is specifically assigned to the Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities described in sections 1 and 2 of that advisory.
*   The advisory also provides detailed code snippets demonstrating the vulnerable code sections.
