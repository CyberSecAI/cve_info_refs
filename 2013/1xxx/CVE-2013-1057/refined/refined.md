Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-1057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `maas-import-pxe-files` script in MAAS (Metal as a Service) incorrectly loads configuration settings from the current working directory. Specifically, it uses the command `[ -r $local_settings ] && . $local_settings`, which sources the file specified by `$local_settings`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Untrusted Search Path:** The script searches for and sources configuration files relative to the current working directory without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious configuration.
-   **Code Execution:** By creating a malicious `import_pxe_files` file within an attacker-controlled directory (e.g. `/tmp/etc/maas/`), an unprivileged user can cause the `maas-import-pxe-files` script (which runs with elevated privileges) to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `maas-import-pxe-files` (which is generally root).
-   **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user can gain root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where MAAS is installed.
-   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create files in a directory where the `maas-import-pxe-files` script is executed, typically a writable directory like /tmp.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the vulnerable `maas-import-pxe-files` script is located.
-   **File Write Permissions:** The attacker needs to have write permissions in a directory from which `maas-import-pxe-files` is executed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by not loading configuration options from the current working directory.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in the following package versions: `maas-cluster-controller 1.3+bzr1461+dfsg-0ubuntu2.3` for Ubuntu 13.04, `maas-cluster-controller 1.2+bzr1373+dfsg-0ubuntu1.1` for Ubuntu 12.10, and `maas-cluster-controller 1.2+bzr1373+dfsg-0ubuntu1~12.04.4` for Ubuntu 12.04.
- The vulnerability is related to the insecure usage of `source` or `.`, which executes the content of a specified file as shell commands.
