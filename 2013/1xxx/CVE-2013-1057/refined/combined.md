| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [MAAS](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas) | Fix Released | Critical | [Julian Edwards](https://launchpad.net/~julian-edwards) | [MAAS 13.10 "saucy"](https://launchpad.net/maas/%2Bmilestone/13.10) |

### Bug Description

From /usr/sbin/maas-import-pxe-files:

# Load settings if available.

settings="/etc/maas/import\_pxe\_files"

[ -r $settings ] && . $settings

local\_settings="$(pwd)/$settings"

[ -r $local\_settings ] && . $local\_settings

Consider what would happen if the admin runs this from /tmp and an unprivileged user has created their own /tmp/etc/maas/import\_pxe\_files file.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Release notes

13.10

=====

Major new features

------------------

LLDP collection.

  MAAS now collects LLDP data on each node during its

  commissioning cycle. The router to which the node is connected will have

  its MAC address parsed out of the data and made available for using as a

  placement constraint (passing connected\_to or not\_connected\_to to the

  acquire() API call), or you can define tags using expressions such as

  ``//lldp:chassis/lldp:id[@type="mac"]/text() = "20:4e:7f:94:2e:10"``

  which would tag nodes with a router using that MAC address.

New faster installer for nodes.

  MAAS will now make use of the new Curtin\_ installer which is much quicker

  than the old Debian Installer process. Typically an installation now

  takes a couple of minutes instead of upwards of 10 minutes. To have a node

  use the faster installer, add the ``use-fastpath-installer`` tag to it,

  or click the "Use the fast installer" button on the node page.

.. \_Curtin: <https://launchpad.net/curtin>

More extensible templates for DHCP, power control, PXE and DNS.

  Templates supplied for these activities are now all in their own template

  file that is customisable by the user. The files now generally live under

  /etc/maas/ rather than embedded in the code tree itself.

Minor feature changes

---------------------

Reworked ephemeral downloading

  While there is no end-user visible change, the ephemeral image download

  process is now driven by a data stream published by Canonical at

  <http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/streams>. In the future this will allow end

  users to use their own customised images by creating their own stream.

  The configuration for this is now also part of ``pserv.yaml``, obsoleting

  the maas\_import\_ephemerals configuration file. The config will be auto-

  migrated on the first run of the ``maas-import-ephemerals`` script.

Improved maas-cli support

  Users can now manage their SSH keys and API credentials via the maas-cli

  tool.

Django 1.5

  MAAS is updated to work with Django 1.5

HP Moonshot Systems support.

  MAAS can now manage HP Moonshot Systems as any other hardware. However,

  in order for MAAS to power manage these systems, it requires the user

  to manually specify the iLO credentials before the enlistment process

  begins. This can be done in the ``maas\_moonshot\_autodetect.py``

  template under ``/etc/maas/templates/commissioning-user-data/snippets/``.

# USN-2013-1: MAAS vulnerabilities

7 November 2013

MAAS could be made to run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [maas](/security/cves?package=maas) - Ubuntu MAAS Server

## Details

It was discovered that maas-import-pxe-files incorrectly loaded

configuration information from the current working directory. A local

attacker could execute code as an administrator if maas-import-pxe-files

were run from an attacker-controlled directory. ([CVE-2013-1057](/security/CVE-2013-1057))

It was discovered that maas-import-pxe-files doesn't cryptographically

verify downloaded content. An attacker could modify images without

detection. ([CVE-2013-1058](/security/CVE-2013-1058))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [maas-cluster-controller](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/maas)
  -
  [1.3+bzr1461+dfsg-0ubuntu2.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/maas/1.3%2Bbzr1461%2Bdfsg-0ubuntu2.3)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [maas-cluster-controller](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/maas)
  -
  [1.2+bzr1373+dfsg-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/maas/1.2%2Bbzr1373%2Bdfsg-0ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [maas-cluster-controller](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/maas)
  -
  [1.2+bzr1373+dfsg-0ubuntu1~12.04.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/maas/1.2%2Bbzr1373%2Bdfsg-0ubuntu1~12.04.4)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
