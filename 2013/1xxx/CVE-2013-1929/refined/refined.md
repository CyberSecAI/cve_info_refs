  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the tg3_read_vpd function of the Broadcom tg3 ethernet driver in the Linux kernel. The vulnerability occurs when the tg3 driver reads and copies firmware string from hardware's Vital Product Data (VPD). If the firmware string exceeds 32 characters, a buffer overflow can occur.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with physical access to a machine could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate privileges on the system. Arbitrary code execution is also a possibility.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user with physical access"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "Physical access to the machine. Must be able to influence the VPD of the device to provide firmware strings longer than 32 characters."
