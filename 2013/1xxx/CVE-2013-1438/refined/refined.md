Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-1438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `dcraw` code base, which is used for processing raw image files from digital cameras. Specifically, it involves issues that can be triggered by specially crafted photo files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Division by zero error
- Infinite loop
- Null pointer dereference

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). Exploiting the vulnerability causes the application using the affected library to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing specially crafted photo files to applications using vulnerable versions of dcraw/libraw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious image file to the vulnerable application. This can be done remotely, often by tricking the user into opening the file or by an attacker uploading it to a server that processes such files.

**Affected Software**
- `dcraw` itself
- `libraw` (versions prior to 0.15.4)
- `ufraw`
- `shotwell`
- `darktable`
- `libkdcraw`
- `digikam`
- Possibly Google Picasa.

**Additional details:**
- The Debian Security Advisory indicates the issue is a local denial of service.
- The openwall.com content clarifies the root cause is in dcraw. The issues include division by zero, infinite loops, and null pointer dereferences.
- Oracle lists the affected component as Dcraw
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, according to the Oracle bulletin.
