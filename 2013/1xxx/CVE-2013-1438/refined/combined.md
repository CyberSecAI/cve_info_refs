# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016

Several denial-of-service vulnerabilities were discovered in the dcraw
code base, a program for procesing raw format images from digital
cameras.  This update corrects them in the copy that is embedded in
the exactimage package.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.1-3+deb6u2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in

Subject: [notification] libraw: multiple denial of service vulnerabilities

Hi,

During a review for EDF I found a few denial of service
vulnerabilities in LibRaw.

CVE-2013-1438:

Specially crafted photo files may trigger a division by zero, an
infinite loop, or a null pointer dereference in libraw leading to
denial of service in applications using the library.
These vulnerabilities appear to originate in dcraw and as such any
program or library based on it is affected. To name a few confirmed
applications: dcraw, ufraw. Other affected software: shotwell,
darktable, and libkdcraw (Qt-style interface to libraw, using embedded
copy) which is used by digikam.

Google Picasa apparently uses dcraw/ufraw so it might be affected.
dcraw's homepage has a list of applications that possibly still use
it:
<http://cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/>

Affected versions of libraw: confirmed: 0.8-0.15.3; but it is likely
that all versions are affected.

(not listing all the other applications as I'm only considering libraw
as the piece with CVE relevance, given the fact that it is a library.)

Fixed in: libraw 0.15.4

CVE-2013-1439:

Specially crafted photo files may trigger a series of conditions in
which a null pointer is dereferenced leading to denial of service in
applications using the library. These three vulnerabilities are
in/related to the 'faster LJPEG decoder', which upstream states was
introduced in LibRaw 0.13 and support for which is going to be dropped
in 0.16.

Affected versions of libraw: 0.13.x-0.15.x

Fixed in: libraw 0.15.4

Patches:
0.15.x:
<https://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw/commit/11909cc59e712e09b508dda729b99aeaac2b29ad>
Future 0.16.x:
<https://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw/commit/9ae25d8c3a6bfb40c582538193264f74c9b93bc0>

(upstream decided to commit all fixes in a single commit. The missing
changes in the patch for 0.16 are the ones that correspond to
CVE-2013-4139. I.e. 0.16 patchset is CVE-2013-1438, while the 0.15
patchset is CVE-2013-4138 + CVE-2013-4139.)

Upstream states that there will be backported fixes for the 0.14
branch but there won't be any new release and "[they] should use
0.14-stable branch from github repo".

BCC'ing Dave Coffin, author of dcraw.

I would like to thank upstream, Alex Tutubalin, for his cooperation.

Cheers,
