The provided content relates to CVE-2013-1662.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from the `vmware-mount` utility's use of `system()` or `popen()` to execute the `lsb_release` command without properly dropping privileges first. This is compounded by Debian's default use of `dash` as `/bin/sh`, which does not drop privileges in the same manner as `bash` when invoked as `sh`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use of `system()` or `popen()` in a setuid program: These functions execute commands through `/bin/sh`, which can be manipulated by an attacker through environment variables or by placing malicious executables in the path.
- Inadequate privilege dropping in setuid binaries: `vmware-mount` does not drop privileges before calling `system()` or `popen()`.
- Debian's disabling of bash's privilege dropping mechanism and using `dash` as default shell

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker can achieve root privilege escalation by manipulating the environment or path in a way that causes `vmware-mount` to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. For example, a malicious user can create a custom `lsb_release` executable in a writable directory and then execute `vmware-mount` which will execute the attacker's `lsb_release` executable with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker with the ability to execute `vmware-mount`.
- Manipulation of PATH variable by the attacker.
- Creation of a malicious executable in the path to be executed by the setuid program

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to a system with `vmware-mount` installed and the setuid bit set on the executable.
- Ability to write to a directory that appears earlier in the PATH than `/usr/bin` or `/bin`, or manipulate environment variables.
