{
  "Root cause": "The X-Frame-Options header was ignored when server push was used in multi-part responses.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "The browser did not check for the X-Frame-Options header in the individual parts of a multipart response, only in the main HTTP response. When server push is used, the document is rendered from a part, not an HTTP response. The X-Frame-Options header is set in both the multipart response and the individual parts, but Firefox only checks the main HTTP response.",
     "The browser also ignored the X-Frame-Options header when Content-disposition is 'inline'."
    ],
  "Impact": "A clickjacking attack is possible when a site uses server push and relies on X-Frame-Options header protection.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can embed a vulnerable site into an iframe, which will allow for clickjacking if the X-Frame-Options header is ignored.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a website and be able to convince the user to visit their website with a browser vulnerable to the issue."
