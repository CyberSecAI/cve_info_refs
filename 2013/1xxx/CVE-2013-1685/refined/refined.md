Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-1685:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free error in the `nsIDocument::GetRootElement` function. The `mCachedRootElement` is being used after it has been removed and destroyed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed. Specifically, `mCachedRootElement` is accessed after it's been deallocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** The vulnerability is described as potentially exploitable, leading to arbitrary code execution. This is due to the use of a vtable pointer which could be overwritten.
*   **Crash:** The initial impact is a crash within the application, specifically in `nsINode::GetParentNode()`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by removing or modifying the root element of an HTML document and then changing the URL or reloading the document, often combined with garbage collection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted webpage (or email content if scripting is enabled) that can trigger the sequence of actions to expose the use-after-free. Specifically, an attacker needs to manipulate the DOM to cause a deallocation of a root element and then attempt to access the element again.
*   The attacker requires the ability to execute JavaScript, either directly in a browser or indirectly through a mail client with scripting enabled.

**Additional Details (From Bugzilla):**

*   The crash occurs in `nsINode::GetParentNode` and leads to an attempt to access a freed vtable.
*   The crash can lead to a potentially exploitable state in release builds, where the program would not unwind to `nsHTMLDocument::GetBody` but attempt a call using the dangling pointer, allowing for code execution.
*   A test case that reproduces the crash involves removing/modifying the root element in combination with changing the URL which helps trigger the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**

*   The fix involves nulling out the `mCachedRootElement` before the update goes out of scope, preventing the use-after-free condition.

**Affected Products:**

*   Mozilla Firefox
*   Mozilla Thunderbird
*   Mozilla SeaMonkey
*   Firefox ESR
*   Thunderbird ESR
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise Products (Server, Desktop)
*   OpenSUSE
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux
*   Debian
*   Ubuntu
