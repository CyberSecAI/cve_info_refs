Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The GroupWise Client for Windows does not properly sanitize or restrict the execution of scripts embedded within HTML email messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a form of XSS, where a malicious script (JavaScript or ActiveX) embedded in an email message can be executed by the GroupWise client.
- **Lack of Script Restriction:** The client allows users to explicitly enable the execution of embedded scripts through a warning banner, which can be exploited by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Windows workstations running the GroupWise client by enticing a user to open a malicious email. This means attackers could potentially gain complete control over the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** The primary attack vector is through email. The attacker sends a crafted email message containing malicious JavaScript or ActiveX script within its HTML body.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the user to open the malicious email message within the GroupWise client and then explicitly allow the embedded script to run by clicking on the yellow warning banner.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere with the ability to send emails.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use social engineering tactics to entice the user to open the malicious email and click on the warning banner allowing script execution.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects GroupWise Client for Windows versions 8.0x up to and including 8.0.3 HP2 and 2012 up to and including 12.0.1 HP1.
- The fix involves disabling the "Click here to allow access" functionality through a new Windows registry key ("HTMLScriptsBlocked"). This will prevent users from running embedded scripts in email messages.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Bartlomiej Balcerek at Wroclaw Centre for Networking and Supercomputing.
- Older, unsupported versions of GroupWise Client for Windows (6.5, 7.x) are likely also vulnerable.
- The provided information is more detailed than a standard CVE description, giving specific version information, the registry key solution and a description of the vulnerability trigger.
