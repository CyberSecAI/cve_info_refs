Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-1860:

**CVE-2013-1860**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's USB subsystem, specifically within the cdc-wdm driver used for managing USB CDC WCM (Wireless Data Model) devices.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The cdc-wdm driver has a flaw where it doesn't properly handle the size of data being copied into a buffer. A specially crafted USB device sending more data than expected can cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver doesn't adequately check the size of the incoming data from the USB device before copying it into memory.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting the buffer overflow, an attacker can crash the system.
    *   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially leverage the overflow to inject and execute arbitrary code, thus escalating privileges on the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Physical Access Required:** The attacker needs physical access to the target system to plug in a maliciously crafted USB device.
    *   **Specially Crafted USB Device:** The attack is triggered by a specially crafted USB device that reports the cdc-wdm class. This device is designed to send more data than the driver's buffer can handle, causing the overflow.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Physical access to the target machine:**  The attacker must be able to plug a malicious USB device into the vulnerable system.
    *   **Ability to create or modify USB devices:** The attacker needs to prepare a USB device which triggers the vulnerability when plugged in.

**Additional Details from Analyzed Content**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel and affects systems that have the USB CDC WDM driver enabled.
*   The issue is a heap-based buffer overflow in the cdc-wdm driver that could lead to a crash or potentially privilege escalation by a local user.
*   The vulnerability was introduced by a commit that updated the CDC WDM driver to support new USB devices.
*   Patches for this vulnerability were distributed via Red Hat errata and upstream Linux kernel commits.
*   The fix involves setting a flag, dropping data, and returning an error when a buffer overflow would happen, and properly validating the data length.

**Summary of Patches**

The patches address the buffer overflow by adding checks and controls in the `wdm_in_callback()` function to prevent excessive data from overflowing the buffer, setting a flag when this occurs, and returning an error during `wdm_read` call if the overflow occurred, to avoid subsequent access to corrupted memory.

**Affected Systems**

*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
*   Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2
*   Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
*   Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10 and 10.04
