  "CVE-2013-1912": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way HAProxy handled pipelined HTTP requests. A remote attacker could send pipelined HTTP requests that would cause HAProxy to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running HAProxy. This issue only affected systems using all of the following combined configuration options: HTTP keep alive enabled, HTTP keywords in TCP inspection rules, and request appending rules.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper buffer realignment when processing pipelined HTTP requests when HTTP keep-alive, HTTP inspection in TCP rules and request appending rules are used in combination. Specifically the issue occurs because buffer realignment performed during normal HTTP request processing, is not performed when HTTP inspection occurs within a `tcp-request content` rule. With HTTP keep-alive, this situation can occur at the beginning of each subsequent request. This means that if a second request is pipelined before the first is forwarded, the second request will not be realigned. Consequently, if a sufficient number of pipelined, unaligned requests are rewritten, there might be less room remaining in the buffer than what is reserved. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the processing of the requests causes data to be appended past the end of the allocated buffer space.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the HAProxy service, or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running HAProxy.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker sending crafted pipelined HTTP requests to a vulnerable HAProxy server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable server.",
    "Affected configurations": [
      "HTTP keep-alive enabled",
      "HTTP keywords in TCP inspection rules",
      "Request appending rules"
      "Pipelined HTTP requests"
    ]
