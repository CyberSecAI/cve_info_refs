{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The libXi library does not properly validate the lengths and/or indexes returned by the X server in the XGetDeviceButtonMapping, _XIPassiveGrabDevice and XQueryDeviceState functions. This can lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
       "Memory corruption",
       "Unvalidated lengths"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code. Privilege escalation is also possible if a privileged client is connected to an unprivileged server.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious X server can send crafted responses to client requests, triggering the vulnerabilities when the client processes the data.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control or manipulate the X server that a vulnerable client is connected to. This could involve creating a malicious virtual X server, or compromising an existing one."
