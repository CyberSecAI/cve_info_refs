- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow existed in the handling of 'dref' atoms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Playing a maliciously crafted movie file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:  Playing a maliciously crafted movie file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious movie file with a specially crafted 'dref' atom, and have a user open the file with a vulnerable version of QuickTime.
