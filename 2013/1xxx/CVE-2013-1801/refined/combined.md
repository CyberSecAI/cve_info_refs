| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=917229#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-03-02 08:47:05 UTC  ```  Tasha Drew reports:  Researchers investigating the Rails parameter parsing vulnerability discovered  that the same or similar vulnerable code had made its way into multiple other  libraries. If your application uses these libraries to process untrusted data,  it may still be vulnerable even if you have upgraded Rails. Check your Gemfile  and Gemfile.lock for vulnerable versions of the following libraries, and if you are using one, update it immediately.  You can update each of these by using "bundle update <gem name>".  httparty  Vulnerable: <= 0.9.0  Fixed: 0.10.0  External references: <https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/entries/22915701-january-14-2013-security-vulnerabilities-httparty-extlib-crack-nori-update-these-gems-immediately>  <https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/commit/53a812426dd32108d6cba4272b493aa03bc8c031>  <https://rubygems.org/gems/httparty/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=917229#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-03-02 08:49:59 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-httparty tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-all [[bug 917231](show_bug.cgi?id=917231 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-1801 Ruby Gem httparty: YAML parameter parsing vulnerability [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=917229#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-03-02 08:51:19 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-httparty tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 917232](show_bug.cgi?id=917232 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-1801 Ruby Gem httparty: YAML parameter parsing vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
