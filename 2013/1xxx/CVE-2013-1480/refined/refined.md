  "CVE-2013-1480": {
    "description": "Multiple flaws were found in the way image parsers in the 2D and AWT components handled image raster parameters. A specially-crafted image could cause Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to arbitrary code execution with the virtual machine privileges.",

      {
        "weakness": "Insufficient validation of raster parameters in image parsing",
        "attack_vector": "Specially crafted image",
