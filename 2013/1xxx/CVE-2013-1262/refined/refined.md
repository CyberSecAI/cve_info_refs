```
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) improperly handles objects in memory, leading to a race condition.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Race condition in the Windows kernel-mode driver.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.

Attack vectors: An attacker must first log on to the system locally. Then, they can run a specially crafted application to trigger the race condition.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the system. They also need the ability to run a specially crafted application.
