| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Affected Products  * Cisco IOS devices are vulnerable when running a software image of an affected version of Cisco IOS Software that does not support IKE version 2 (IKEv2) and is configured to use IKE version 1 (IKEv1).   Vulnerable ProductsDetermine if the Device is Running an Affected Version of Cisco IOS SoftwareThis vulnerability affects the 15.1GC, 15.1T, and 15.1XB Cisco IOS Software release trains. No other Cisco IOS Software release trains are affected. To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Determine if the Cisco IOS Software Version Supports IKEv2Cisco IOS Software introduced support for IKEv2 in software version 15.1(1)T for select platforms. To determine if the device has an image that supports IKEv2, log into the device and execute the command line interface (CLI) command **show subsys | include ikev2**. If the output contains *ikev2 Library*then the device has support for IKEv2. If the output does not contain *ikev2 Library* then the device does not support IKEv2. In the following example the device has support for IKEv2: ```   ISR2900#show subsys | include ikev2ikev2               Library     1.000.001ikev2_cli_registry  Registry    1.000.001ISR2900#   ```   In the following example the device does not have support for IKEv2:   ```   CISCO2821#show subsys | include ikev2ikev2_cli_registry  Registry    1.000.001CISCO2821#   ``` Determine if the Device is Configured for IKEv1A number of features use IKEv1, including different Virtual Private Networks (VPN) such as:   + LAN-to-LAN VPN   + Remote access VPN (excluding SSLVPN)   + Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)   + Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI)There are two methods to determine if a device is configured for IKEv1:   + Determine if IKE ports are open on a running device   + Determine if IKEv1 features are included in the device configuration**Determine if IKE Ports are Open on a Running Device** The preferred method to determine if a device has been configured for IKE is to issue the   **show udp** CLI command. If the device has UDP port 500, UDP port 4500, UDP port 848, or UDP port 4848 open, it is processing IKE packets.  In the following example, the device is configured to process IKE packets on UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500,   using either IPv4 or IPv6:  ```   Router#show udpProto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF 17       --listen--          --any--          1975   0   0 1000001   0 17       --listen--          192.168.100.1     500   0   0 1001011   0 17(v6)   --listen--          FD80::1           500   0   0 1020011   0 17       --listen--          192.168.100.1    4500   0   0 1001011   0 17(v6)   --listen--          FD80::1          4500   0   0 1020011   0Router#   ``` **Determine if IKEv1 Features are included in the Device Configuration**         To determine if a Cisco IOS device configuration is vulnerable, the   administrator needs to determine whether there is at least one configured   feature that uses IKE. This can be achieved by using the    **show run | include crypto map|tunnel protection ipsec|crypto gdoi** enable mode command.   If the output of this command contains either *tunnel protection ipsec,* or, *crypto gdoi* then the device contains an IKE configuration. If the output of this command contains *crypto map,* check that the crypto map is configured as *ipsec-isakmp*.   The following example shows a device that has been configured for IKE: ```   router# show run | include crypto map|tunnel protection ipsec|crypto gdoi   crypto map CM 100 ipsec-isakmp     crypto map CM   router#   ```   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco devices that are running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software which has support for IKEv2 are not affected, regardless if IKEv1 is configured or not.      The following products have support for both IKEv1 and IKEv2 and are confirmed not affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco ASR 5000 Series Small Cell Gateway   + Cisco Access Service Network (ASN) Gateway   + Cisco ePDG (On ASR5000)   + The SAMI based Wireless Security Gateway (WSG).   + Cisco NX-OS Software   + Cisco ASA Software   + Cisco AnyConnect   + Cisco CGR 1000 routersNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of IKE packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IKE packets to a device configured with features that leverage IKEv1. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak on the affected device which could lead to a DoS condition.   To identify if a device is being exploited by this vulnerability, examine the contents of the old buffers. A device that is affected by this vulnerability will show a buffer leak in the **Crypto IKE Dis user** and will show buffers being leaked in **Crypto IK**. The following example shows a system that is experiencing a memory leak due to this vulnerability:  ```   Router#show buffer leak  Header DataArea  Pool  Size Link  Enc    Flags      Input     Output User49AB48C0 3F405384 Small     0    0    0        0       None       None Init49ABB8DC 3F4072C4 Middl   419    7    1       80      Gi0/0       None Crypto IK49ABBD58 3F407604 Middl   419    7    1       80      Gi0/0       None Crypto IK49ABC1D4 3F407944 Middl   419    7    1       80      Gi0/0       None Crypto IK49ABC650 3F407C84 Middl   419    7    1       80      Gi0/0       None Crypto IKRouter#show buffer leak resource userResource User:           Init count:       21Resource User: Crypto IKE Dis count:      100Resource User:  EEM ED Syslog count:       10Resource User: IP ARP Adjacen count:        1   ``` If the network is experiencing active exploitation, the **Crypto IKE Dis** count will increase. This vulnerability can be exploited via either IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic destined to the device can trigger the vulnerability; transit traffic is not an exploit vector.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCth81055](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCth81055) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1144.  Workarounds  * The following identification mechanism exist for this vulnerability.Embedded Event Manager (EEM)A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect a memory leak that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the memory for the affected process on a Cisco IOS device. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade or reload the device to recover the lost memory at a suitable time. The example policy is based on a Tcl script that sends a syslog when the memory keeps dropping and reaches EEM\_IKE\_BUFF\_INCR\_THRES and when the IKE buffers have dropped EEM\_IKE\_BUFF\_INCR\_THRES times. If IKE buffers are freed the counter starts counting from zero. After generating the memory leak syslog the script re-initializes.   The Tcl script is available for download at the "Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community" at the following link: <https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-30300>. A sample device configuration is provided below.    ```   event manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_INTERVAL 20event manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_MAX_RUNTIME 5event manager environment EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES 3event manager environment EEM_FREE_MEMORY_THRES 70event manager directory user policy "flash:/"event manager policy eem_ike_mem_leak.tcl   ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train.
