  "CVE-2013-1643": {
    "Description": "A security flaw was found in the way SOAP parser of PHP processed certain SOAP objects (due to allowed expansion of XML external entities during SOAP WSDL files parsing, it was previously possible to read arbitrary system files, accessible with the privileges of the PHP application). If a PHP application accepted untrusted SOAP object input remotely from clients, an attacker could use this flaw for unauthorized of read system files (accesible with the privileges of the PHP application).  The soap.wsdl_cache_dir function did not take PHP open_basedir restrictions into account. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to read arbitrary files that are accessible to a PHP application using a SOAP extension. It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled XML external entities in SOAP WSDL files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read arbitrary files off the server. This issue was not correctly fixed in 5.4.12 or 5.3.22, so CVE-2013-1824 was assigned to the incorrect fix present in 5.4.12 and 5.3.22.  It was correctly fixed in 5.4.13 and 5.3.23.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of XML external entities during SOAP WSDL files parsing and lack of open_basedir restriction validation in soap.wsdl_cache_dir function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "XML external entity (XXE) injection",
       "Improper file access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthorized reading of arbitrary system files accessible to the PHP application by a remote attacker.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via a crafted SOAP WSDL file containing XML external entities."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to provide crafted SOAP WSDL file to a vulnerable PHP application"
    ],
      "Affected components": [
        "SOAP parser of PHP"
      ],
      "Affected versions": [
          "PHP before 5.3.23",
          "PHP 5.4.x before 5.4.13"
      ],
        "Additional Details": "The issue was not correctly fixed in 5.4.12 or 5.3.22, so CVE-2013-1824 was assigned to the incorrect fix present in 5.4.12 and 5.3.22."
