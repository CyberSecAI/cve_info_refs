  "cveId": "CVE-2013-1425",
  "description": "ldap-git-backup before 1.0.4 exposes password hashes due to incorrect directory permissions.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the creation of the backup directory `/var/backups/ldap` with overly permissive default permissions (0755).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect directory permissions"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of password hashes contained within the LDAP dump files stored in the backup directory. This allows any local user on the system to read these files, potentially leading to unauthorized access.",
     "attackVectors": [
       "Local access to the file system"
      ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker would require local access to the system in order to exploit the vulnerability. They do not need any elevated privileges to read the backup files once created with the vulnerable default permissions."
  },
    "affectedSoftware": {
        "name": "ldap-git-backup",
        "versions": "before 1.0.4"
    },
  "patchInformation": {
    "fixedVersion": "1.0.4",
    "fixDetails": "The fix involves modifying the script to create the backup directory with more restrictive permissions (0700), preventing unauthorized access."
