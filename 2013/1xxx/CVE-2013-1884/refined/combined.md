## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [subversion](/security/cves?package=subversion) - Advanced version control system

## Details

Alexander Klink discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module for

Apache did not properly handle a large number of properties. A remote

authenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause memory consumption,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1845](/security/CVE-2013-1845))

Ben Reser discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module for

Apache did not properly handle certain LOCKs. A remote authenticated

attacker could use this flaw to cause Subversion to crash, leading to a

denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1846](/security/CVE-2013-1846))

Philip Martin and Ben Reser discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn

module for Apache did not properly handle certain LOCKs. A remote

attacker could use this flaw to cause Subversion to crash, leading to a

denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1847](/security/CVE-2013-1847))

It was discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module for Apache did not

properly handle certain PROPFIND requests. A remote attacker could use this

flaw to cause Subversion to crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2013-1849](/security/CVE-2013-1849))

Greg McMullin, Stefan Fuhrmann, Philip Martin, and Ben Reser discovered

that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module for Apache did not properly handle

certain log REPORT requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause

Subversion to crash, leading to a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu 13.04. ([CVE-2013-1884](/security/CVE-2013-1884))

Stefan Sperling discovered that Subversion incorrectly handled newline

characters in filenames. A remote authenticated attacker could use this

flaw to corrupt FSFS repositories. ([CVE-2013-1968](/security/CVE-2013-1968))

Boris Lytochkin discovered that Subversion incorrectly handled TCP

connections that were closed early. A remote attacker could use this flaw

to cause Subversion to crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2013-2112](/security/CVE-2013-2112))

=== Content from subversion.apache.org_0ab50f25_20250125_235937.html ===
 Subversion HTTP servers 1.7.0 to 1.7.8 (inclusive) are vulnerable
to a remotely triggerable segfault DoS vulnerability.
Summary:
========
Subversion's mod\_dav\_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash when
a log REPORT request receives a limit that is out of the allowed range.
This can lead to a DoS. There are no known instances of this
problem being used as a DoS in the wild.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.7.0 through 1.7.8 (inclusive)
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.9
svnserve (any version) is not vulnerable
Details:
========
The vulnerability can be triggered by doing a log REPORT request with a
limit outside the allowed range.
For example where http://127.0.0.1:8080/repo is the root of a repository:
curl -X REPORT --data-binary @log\_report 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/repo/!svn/bc/1/'
Where a file exists named log\_report and has the following contents:
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?
0
1
9223372036854775807

The limit is defined as an int, which is generally a 32-bit value. Prior to
1.7.0 such a request would have caused the limit to wrap and not necessarily
reflected what the requestor intended. In 1.7.0 code was added to detect this
and reject out of range values as errors. However, the error code ends up
causing the attempted use of a variable that has not been set, resulting in
the segfault.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 5.0
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P
We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. Configurations which
allow anonymous read access to the repository will be vulnerable to this
without authentication.
A remote attacker may be able to crash a Subversion server. Many Apache
servers will respawn the listener processes, but a determined attacker
will be able to crash these processes as they appear, denying service to
legitimate users. Servers using threaded MPMs will close the connection
on other clients being served by the same process that services the
REPORT request from the attacker.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.7.9. Users of
Subversion 1.7.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
included patch.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
There is no httpd configuration that can counter this issue.
