Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a built-in function within the DELL SonicWALL GMS/Viewpoint/Analyzer web interface that allows bypassing the session check. This is achieved by using the `skipSessionCheck` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the web interface authentication mechanism. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access without valid credentials.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The application improperly handles the `skipSessionCheck` parameter, allowing it to disable session checks and bypass authentication.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The vulnerability also allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files via the `appliance` application. This is a critical vulnerability, as it allows for code execution on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full administrative access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this to execute code with root or SYSTEM permissions on the affected system.
*   **System Compromise:** The ultimate impact is a full compromise of the system, including the ability to potentially control the system, steal data, or use it for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring any prior authentication or user interaction.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/appliance/` interface, including the `skipSessionCheck=1` parameter to bypass authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SonicWALL GMS/Viewpoint/Analyzer system.
*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests, including setting parameters and sending multipart form data.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by a simple parameter: `skipSessionCheck=1`.
*   The attacker can use this bypass to access functionalities such as file upload, enabling the execution of malicious code by uploading a jsp shell.
*   The provided Metasploit module uses the bypass and file upload vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.
*   Exploit scripts are available which demonstrate the remote command execution capability.
