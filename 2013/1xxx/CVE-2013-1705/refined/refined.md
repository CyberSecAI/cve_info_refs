Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer underflow in the `cryptojs_interpret_key_gen_type` function within the `nsCrypto.cpp` file, specifically when generating a Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) request.
- The function attempts to trim whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. If an empty string is provided, a decrement operation on a pointer leads to an out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Underflow:** The core issue is a buffer underflow during string processing in C++. The pointer arithmetic used for trimming the string goes out of bounds when given an empty string. This can lead to writing to arbitrary memory locations, which could lead to crashes.
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability allows writing a null byte to memory before the allocated buffer, which could corrupt heap metadata or other data structures leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a potentially exploitable crash.
- **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write corrupts memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if attacker controls the memory layout.
- **Information Leak:**  Although not stated explicitly, memory corruption could potentially lead to information disclosure.
- **Denial of Service:** A crash would cause denial of service as the affected application would terminate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **JavaScript Code Execution:** An attacker could craft malicious JavaScript code that calls the vulnerable `crypto.generateCRMFRequest` function with specific parameters to trigger the buffer underflow.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** This vulnerability can be exploited in a web browser environment through malicious web pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in the context of the affected application (e.g., a web browser).
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable API:** The attacker needs to know the specific API (`crypto.generateCRMFRequest`) and how to use it with the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Notes from the Bugzilla entry:**
- **Severity Upgrade:**  Initially rated as "sec-moderate", the bug was later reclassified as "sec-critical" after analysis showed that it is capable of triggering crashes and memory corruption.
- **Test Case:** The bug report includes a test case that shows how to trigger the vulnerability, which includes a JavaScript code snippet and a test html.
- **Fix:** The fix includes handling the edge case of an empty string, and proper error handling and sanitization of the input.
- **Exploitation potential:** The provided details from comment 25 and 26 indicate that this vulnerability could potentially be exploited.
- **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Firefox, Seamonkey, and also Firefox ESR 17.
- **Timeline:**  The vulnerability was discovered and fixed relatively quickly, with patches landing in different branches (including ESR) within a few weeks.
