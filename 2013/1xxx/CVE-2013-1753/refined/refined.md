The provided content relates to CVE-2013-1753.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `xmlrpc.client.gzip_decode()` function in Python's XML-RPC library does not limit the amount of data it reads and decompresses from a gzipped HTTP stream.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unbounded read:** The `gzip_decode()` function performs an unlimited read operation when decompressing data, which can lead to excessive memory consumption.
- **Gzip Bomb vulnerability:** A malicious server can send a specially crafted compressed response (a "gzip bomb") that expands to a large size upon decompression, potentially exhausting the client's memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious server can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the client by sending a gzipped response that expands to a large amount of memory when decompressed by the vulnerable `gzip_decode()` function.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious XML-RPC server can send a compressed response that expands into an extremely large amount of data when decompressed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to control the XML-RPC server and be able to send crafted HTTP responses that are compressed using gzip.
