Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2013-1669:

**CVE-2013-1669**

* **Root Cause:** This CVE is related to multiple memory safety hazards found in the browser engine of Firefox, Thunderbird and other Mozilla products. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read crash in the `PropertyProvider::GetSpacingInternal` function. The issue is that `TabWidthStore::mLimit` is stored as a skipped string offset which can change over the lifetime of a frame leading to out-of-bounds reads when calculating tab widths.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Out-of-bounds read: The `GetSpacingInternal` function attempts to read from memory outside the allocated buffer.
    *   Incorrect offset calculation: Storing string offsets as skipped offsets causes issues when the frame lifetime varies.
    *   Use of uninitialized values.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service: Application crash due to the out-of-bounds read.
    *   Potential Information Leak: Although it appears difficult, the out-of-bounds read could be reflected in layout in the form of spacing for a tab character in some cases.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution: As stated in the Ubuntu notice, memory safety issues could be exploited potentially to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Specially crafted web pages: An attacker can create a web page with specific CSS that triggers the vulnerability.
    *   Specially crafted emails: For Thunderbird, an attacker could send a specially crafted email with scripting enabled.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to create/send a crafted web page or email.
    *   Scripting needs to be enabled.
    * No specific privilege or position on the network is required.

**Additional Details (from Bugzilla):**

*   The `TabWidthStore::mLimit` was stored as a skipped string offset, which can vary over the frame lifetime.
*   The fix involves storing it as an unskipped offset relative to the current frame and adding the current skipped offset when using it.
*   There are concerns about stored indices being wrong if the text frame's offset changes.
* The code is complex making security analysis hard.
* The issue is classified as "sec-low" due to difficulty of exploitation although critical in terms of severity.
* Patches are provided and tagged for review and sec-approval.
* This issue is resolved in Firefox 21 and later versions.
* OpenSUSE also addresses the issue by updating Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird to version 21.0 and 17.0.6 respectively.

**Summary of information:**

The vulnerability lies in the way tab width calculations were handled in Mozilla's layout engine. The use of skipped offsets without proper lifetime management leads to out-of-bounds reads. The impact is primarily a denial-of-service due to a crash, although there exists a theoretical possibility for information disclosure. The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted HTML or emails containing specific CSS/scripting. The identified fix involves using unskipped offsets and performing correct offset calculations and adding a mechanism for invalidating stored offsets.
