- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the handling of the management authentication protocol within VMware vCenter Server, vSphere Client, and ESX.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in how the VMware products handle the authentication protocol.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to code execution on the client system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must convince vCenter Server, vSphere Client, or ESX to interact with a malicious server as a client. This suggests a man-in-the-middle or similar attack where the legitimate server is replaced by a malicious one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to position a malicious server in a way that the targeted VMware product will connect to it instead of the intended server.
