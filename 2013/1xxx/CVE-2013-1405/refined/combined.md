##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware vSphere client-side authentication memory corruption vulnerability

VMware vCenter Server, vSphere Client, and ESX contain a vulnerability in the handling of the management authentication protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must convince either vCenter Server, vSphere Client or ESX to interact with a malicious server as a client. Exploitation of the issue may lead to code execution on the client system.
To reduce the likelihood of exploitation, vSphere components should be deployed on an isolated management network.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2013-1405 to this issue.
Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

\* hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Fusion.
\*\* To remediate CVE-2013-1405, customers must apply updates to all components of the authentication service.  First, customers should update vCenter Server or ESXi/ESX as apropriate to ensure that the updated vSphere Client is downloaded.  Then, the vSphere client can be updated using any one of the following methods:

* Run the installer that ships with vCenter Server
* Follow the client installation link on the vCenter Server welcome page
* Follow the client installation link on the ESXi/ESX Server welcome page

#####

b. Update to ESX/ESXi libxml2 userworld and service console
