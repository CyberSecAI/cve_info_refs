Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is a frame injection issue in Javadoc HTML documentation generated by vulnerable versions of the Javadoc tool. It stems from the Javadoc tool's JavaScript code failing to properly parse scheme relative URIs parameters.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper parsing of scheme-relative URIs in Javadoc generated JavaScript.
- Inability of the Javadoc tool to adequately sanitize URL input, leading to injection.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary web script execution within the user's browser session if allowed.
- Phishing attacks by replacing parts of the documentation with spoofed login forms.
- Display of arbitrary web content alongside the documentation.

Attack vectors:
- Remote attackers tricking users into visiting a crafted URL that passes malicious parameters to the vulnerable HTML page.
- Visiting a specially-crafted URL that leads to arbitrary web content.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must be able to host or influence the crafted URL visited by the victim.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges, a user with a web browser is sufficient.
