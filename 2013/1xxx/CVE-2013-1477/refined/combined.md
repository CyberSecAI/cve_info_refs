## Oracle Java contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#858729

Original Release Date: 2013-02-01 | Last Revised: 2013-06-14

---

### Overview

Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier versions of Java contain vulnerabilities that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows users to run Java applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Oracle has made the JRE available for multiple operating systems.  The Java JRE plug-in provides its own [Security Manager](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29). Typically, a web applet runs with a security manager provided by the browser or Java Web Start plugin. Oracle's document [states](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29), *"If there is a security manager already installed, this method first calls the security manager's* *checkPermission* *method with a* *RuntimePermission("setSecurityManager")* *permission to ensure it's safe to replace the existing security manager. This may result in throwing a* *SecurityException"**.* By leveraging a number of vulnerabilities, an untrusted Java applet can escalate its privileges to allow full privileges, without requiring code signing. Other vulnerabilities can cause exploitable memory corruption, which could affect Java applets, as well as Java applications, depending on what the Java application does and how it may process untrusted data. Oracle Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier Java versions are affected.At least one of these vulnerabilities is reportedly being exploited in the wild. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Note that applications that use the Internet Explorer web content rendering components, such as Microsoft Office or Windows Desktop Search, may also be used as an attack vector for these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities that affect server deployments of Java may be exploited by causing a Java server application to process untrusted data. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These issues are addressed in Java 7 Update 13 and Java 6 Update 39. Please see the [Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) - February 2013 for more details. |
| --- |

| **Disable Java in web browsers**Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to [disable Java content in web browsers](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml) through the Java control panel applet. Please see the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable) for more details.System administrators wishing to deploy Java 7 Update 10 or later with the "Enable Java content in the browser" feature disabled can invoke the Java installer with the WEB\_JAVA=0 command-line option. More details are available in the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#install).Alternatively, Microsoft has released a [Fix it](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/05/29/java-when-you-cannot-let-go.aspx) that disables Java in the Internet Explorer web browser.**Restrict access to Java applets**Network administrators unable to disable Java in web browsers may be able to help mitigate this and other Java vulnerabilities by restricting access to Java applets. This may be accomplished by using proxy server rules, for example. Blocking or whitelisting web requests to .jar and .class files can help to prevent Java from being used by untrusted sources. Filtering requests that contain a Java User-Agent header may also be effective. For example, this technique can be used in environments where Java is required on the local intranet. The proxy can be configured to allow Java requests locally, but block them when the destination is a site on the internet. |

Alert
# Oracle Java Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedOctober 19, 2016
Alert CodeTA13-032A

### Systems Affected

Any system using Oracle Java including

* JDK and JRE 7 Update 11 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 6 Update 38 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 38 and earlier
* SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_40 and earlier
* JavaFX 2.2.4 and earlier
* Java 1.6.0\_37 and earlier for Mac OS X and OS X Server 10.6.8

Web browsers using the Java plug-in are at high risk.

### Overview

Multiple vulnerabilities in Java could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

The Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory for [February 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Both Java applets delivered via web browsers and stand-alone Java applications are affected, however web browsers using the Java plug-in are at particularly high risk.

The Java plug-in, the Java Deployment Toolkit plug-in, and Java Web Start can be used as attack vectors. An attacker could use social engineering techniques to entice a user to visit a link to a website hosting a malicious Java applet. An attacker could also compromise a legitimate web site and upload a malicious Java applet (a "drive-by download" attack).

Some vulnerabilities affect stand-alone Java applications, depending on how the Java application functions and how it processes untrusted data.

Reports indicate that at least one of these vulnerabilities is being actively exploited.

Further technical details are available in Vulnerability Note [VU#858729](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/858729).

### Impact

By convincing a user to load a malicious Java applet or Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the Java plug-in process.

Stand-alone java applications may also be affected.

### Solution

**Update Java**

The Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory for [February 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) states that Java 7 Update 13 and Java 6 Update 39 address these vulnerabilities.

**Disable Java in web browsers**

These and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered. To defend against this and future Java vulnerabilities, consider disabling Java in web browsers until adequate updates have been installed. As with any software, unnecessary features should be disabled or removed as appropriate for your environment.

Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to disable Java content in web browsers through the Java control panel applet. From [Setting the Security Level of the Java Client](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable):

For installations where the highest level of security is required, it is possible to entirely prevent *any* Java apps (signed or unsigned) from running in a browser by de-selecting Enable Java content in the browser in the Java Control Panel under the Security tab.

If you are unable to update to Java 7 Update 13 please see the solution section of Vulnerability Note [VU#636312](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312#solution) for instructions on how to disable Java on a per-browser basis.

**Restrict access to Java applets**

Network administrators unable to disable Java in web browsers may be able to help mitigate these and other Java vulnerabilities by restricting access to Java applets [using a web proxy](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2012/11/do-devs-care-about-java-insecurity.html?showComment=1353874245992#c4794680666510382012). Most web proxies have features that can be used to block or whitelist requests for `.jar` and `.class` files based on network location. Filtering requests that contain a Java User-Agent header may also be effective. For environments where Java is required on the local intranet, the proxy can be configured to allow access to Java applets hosted locally, but block access to Java applets on the internet.
