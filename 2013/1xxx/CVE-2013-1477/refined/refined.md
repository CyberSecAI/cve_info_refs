Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Oracle Java:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in multiple vulnerabilities within the Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE), including issues related to the Java Security Manager and memory corruption. Untrusted Java applets can escalate their privileges, bypassing security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Untrusted Java applets can escalate their privileges to gain full access, bypassing the intended security manager.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Certain vulnerabilities can lead to exploitable memory corruption, affecting both Java applets and standalone Java applications.
*   **Bypass Security Manager:** Vulnerabilities allow applets to bypass the security manager.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system by enticing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document or load a malicious Java applet/JNLP file.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, with the attacker gaining control over the affected machine.
*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers may gain access to sensitive data due to privilege escalation

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Browsers:** Exploiting Java applets through web browsers via malicious HTML documents.
*   **Drive-by Downloads:** Compromising legitimate websites and uploading malicious Java applets, resulting in drive-by download attacks.
*   **Social Engineering:** Enticing users to visit links to malicious websites.
*   **Untrusted Data Processing:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in standalone Java applications through the processing of untrusted data.
*   **Java Web Start**: Utilizing malicious JNLP files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need prior authentication or local access to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **Web Server or Compromised Website:** Attackers need to host a malicious Java applet on a web server or compromise a legitimate website.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to convince users to load malicious content.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Java including Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability is being exploited in the wild.
*   The provided content lists multiple CVEs that are related to this vulnerability.
