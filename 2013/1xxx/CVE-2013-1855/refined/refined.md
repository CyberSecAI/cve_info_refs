  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `sanitize_css` method in Action Pack had an XSS vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of CSS inputs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Carefully crafted text could bypass sanitization, leading to arbitrary script execution within the context of the application, potentially compromising user sessions or stealing sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the `sanitize_css` method via crafted CSS input"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to submit crafted CSS data to the application that uses the vulnerable `sanitize_css` method."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability resided in the `sanitize_css` method within Action Pack. Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript by crafting specific CSS. Patches provided address this weakness by improving the sanitization logic to disallow URLs and implement a more robust validation that prevents malicious input from being processed."
