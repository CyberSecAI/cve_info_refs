      "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the configuration report page (adm_config_report.php) in MantisBT 1.2.13 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a project name.",
      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the project name when displaying the project list for a filter on the configuration report page (adm_config_report.php). Specifically, the project name is not properly escaped when being used inside an HTML <option> tag.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
          "Insufficient output sanitization"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, which would then be executed in the context of the MantisBT user's session when they view the configuration report page. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities within the MantisBT application.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "The attacker injects malicious code through a project name.",
           "The malicious code is executed when a user views the Configuration Report page."
