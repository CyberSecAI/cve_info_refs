Package        : telepathy-gabble
Vulnerability  : TLS verification bypass
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1431

Maksim Otstavnov discovered that the Wocky submodule used by
telepathy-gabble, the Jabber/XMPP connection manager for the Telepathy
framework, does not respect the tls-required flag on legacy Jabber
servers. A network intermediary could use this vulnerability to bypass
TLS verification and perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.15-1+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16.5-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.16.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your telepathy-gabble packages.

I'm glad I did that before going into details; apparently, emptying the "QA Contact" is not enough, you have to explicitly set it to something else...  The flaw is that if you connect to a legacy Jabber (i.e. not XMPP) server, WockyConnector:tls-required is not respected: we go straight to trying to perform legacy Jabber authentication. A network intermediary could exploit this by making their man-in-the-middle server implement legacy Jabber, rather than XMPP.  The logic we should follow is: if the server is legacy Jabber, check whether we have already authenticated the server using "old SSL" (https-style SSL without STARTTLS, typically on port 5223). If we haven't, and TLS is required, stop. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=65036#c2)  Simon McVittie    2013-05-27 12:35:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 79847](attachment.cgi?id=79847 "security: respect tls-required flag on legacy Jabber servers") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=79847&action=edit "security: respect tls-required flag on legacy Jabber servers") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=65036&attachment=79847) security: respect tls-required flag on legacy Jabber servers  It's checked elsewhere for XMPP 1.0 servers, which can either use "old SSL" or perform STARTTLS. Legacy Jabber can only use "old SSL", which is similar to https - connect to a separate port, typically 5223, and start speaking SSL - so if the connection was ever going to be encrypted, by this point it already would be. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=65036#c3)  Sjoerd Simons    2013-05-27 12:48:39 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 79847](attachment.cgi?id=79847 "security: respect tls-required flag on legacy Jabber servers") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=79847&action=edit "security: respect tls-required flag on legacy Jabber servers") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=65036&attachment=79847) security: respect tls-required flag on legacy Jabber servers  Review of [attachment 79847](attachment.cgi?id=79847 "security: respect tls-required flag on legacy Jabber servers") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=79847&action=edit "security: respect tls-required flag on legacy Jabber servers") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=65036&attachment=79847): -----------------------------------------------------------------  Looks good (any chance to get a test for it as well?) :) ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=65036#c4)  Simon McVittie    2013-05-28 12:09:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 79891](attachment.cgi?id=79891 "NEWS: update and describe configuration changes for fd.o #65036") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=79891&action=edit "NEWS: update and describe configuration changes for fd.o #65036") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=65036&attachment=79891) NEWS: update and describe configuration changes for fd.o #65036 ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=65036#c5)  Simon McVittie    2013-05-28 12:10:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 79892](attachment.cgi?id=79892 "tests: fix JabberAuthenticator when self.emit_events is  False") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=79892&action=edit "tests: fix JabberAuthenticator when self.emit_events is  False") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=65036&attachment=79892) tests: fix JabberAuthenticator when self.emit_events is  False  We don't currently use JabberAuthenticator in this mode, so nobody noticed that it didn't work.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# CVE-2013-1431: telepathy-gabble: TLS bypass via use of legacy Jabber

---

*From*: Simon McVittie <simon.mcvittie () collabora co uk>

*Date*: Thu, 30 May 2013 15:54:26 +0100

```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Maksim Otstavnov reported a vulnerability in the Wocky submodule used by
telepathy-gabble, an XMPP client implementation for the Telepathy
framework. A network intermediary could use this vulnerability to bypass
TLS verification and perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The Debian
security team has allocated CVE-2013-1431 for this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is fixed in telepathy-gabble 0.16.6 [0]. All
versions since 0.9.x are believed to be vulnerable. The patch
described below is likely to apply to all affected versions without
modification.

If you use an unencrypted connection to a "legacy Jabber" (pre-XMPP)
server, fixed versions of telepathy-gabble will not connect to that
server until you make one of these configuration changes:

• upgrade the server software to something that supports XMPP 1.0; or
• use an encrypted "old SSL" connection, typically on port 5223
  (old-ssl); or
• turn off "Encryption required (TLS/SSL)" (require-encryption).

Since the vulnerable code is in a git submodule, distributors with
tarball-based builds for telepathy-gabble will need to apply a patch
with suitably adjusted paths. A suitable patch[1] is available from
the Telepathy bug report[2]. Distributors who will patch the Wocky
submodule directly can take the patch from the git commit[3].

In the current development branch, versions 0.17.0 to 0.17.3 are
vulnerable; the upcoming 0.17.4 release will fix this vulnerability.

Regards,
    Simon

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [telepathy-gabble](/security/cves?package=telepathy-gabble) - Jabber/XMPP connection manager

## Details

Maksim Otstavnov discovered that telepathy-gabble incorrectly handled

TLS when connecting to legacy jabber servers. If a remote attacker were

able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to

view sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-1431](/security/CVE-2013-1431))

It was discovered that telepathy-gabble incorrectly handled certain

messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause applications using

telepathy-gabble to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2013-1769](/security/CVE-2013-1769))
