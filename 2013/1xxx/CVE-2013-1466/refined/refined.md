    "Root cause": "Insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in multiple HTTP POST parameters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the userâ€™s browser in context of the vulnerable website, potentially leading to cookie theft or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP POST parameters"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to trick a logged-in user into opening a specially crafted link."

    "ID": "CVE-2013-1466",
     "Source": "www.exploit-db.com_ffd15344_20250124_194326.html",
    "Vulnerability Details": "Multiple XSS vulnerabilities were found in glFusion 1.2.2 and prior versions. The 'bad_behaviour' plugin, which is installed by default, checks the HTTP Referer header to prevent spambots, this makes reflected XSS attacks slightly more difficult but not impossible. The vulnerabilities are in the following:\n\n  *   profiles.php script: insufficient filtration of the \"subject\" HTTP POST parameter.\n  *  calendar/index.php script: insufficient filtration of the \"address1\", \"address2\", \"calendar_type\", \"city\", \"state\", \"title\", \"url\", and \"zipcode\" HTTP POST parameters.\n  *   links/index.php script: insufficient filtration of the \"title\" and \"url\" HTTP POST parameters.\n  *   admin/plugins/mediagallery/xppubwiz.php script: insufficient filtration of user supplied data in the URI after the script name.\n",
      "Additional Details": "Proof-of-concept (PoC) codes are provided to demonstrate the vulnerabilities, utilizing JavaScript's `alert()` function to display user's cookies. The PoCs involve crafting HTML forms with malicious values for the vulnerable parameters and using an iframe to submit the form to the vulnerable page."
