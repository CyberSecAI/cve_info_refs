Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0744)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Security:

* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was

found in the way the Intel i915 driver in the Linux kernel handled the
allocation of the buffer used for relocation copies. A local user with
console access could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate
their privileges. (CVE-2013-0913, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way UTF-8 characters were

converted to UTF-16 in the utf8s\_to\_utf16s() function of the Linux kernel's
FAT file system implementation. A local user able to mount a FAT file
system with the "utf8=1" option could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1773, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way KVM handled guest time updates when the

buffer the guest registered by writing to the MSR\_KVM\_SYSTEM\_TIME machine
state register (MSR) crossed a page boundary. A privileged guest user could
use this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges,
allowing them to execute arbitrary code at the host kernel level.
(CVE-2013-1796, Important)

* A potential use-after-free flaw was found in the way KVM handled guest

time updates when the GPA (guest physical address) the guest registered by
writing to the MSR\_KVM\_SYSTEM\_TIME machine state register (MSR) fell into a
movable or removable memory region of the hosting user-space process (by
default, QEMU-KVM) on the host. If that memory region is deregistered from
KVM using KVM\_SET\_USER\_MEMORY\_REGION and the allocated virtual memory
reused, a privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to
escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2013-1797, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way KVM emulated IOAPIC (I/O Advanced

Programmable Interrupt Controller). A missing validation check in the
ioapic\_read\_indirect() function could allow a privileged guest user to
crash the host, or read a substantial portion of host kernel memory.
(CVE-2013-1798, Important)

* A race condition in install\_user\_keyrings(), leading to a NULL pointer

dereference, was found in the key management facility. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2013-1792, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference in the XFRM implementation could allow a local

user who has the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2013-1826, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol

(DCCP) implementation could allow a local user to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2013-1827, Moderate)

* Information leak flaws in the XFRM implementation could allow a local

user who has the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to leak kernel stack memory to
user-space. (CVE-2012-6537, Low)

* Two information leak flaws in the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)

subsystem could allow a local, unprivileged user to leak kernel stack
memory to user-space. (CVE-2012-6546, Low)

* An information leak was found in the TUN/TAP device driver in the

networking implementation. A local user with access to a TUN/TAP virtual
interface could use this flaw to leak kernel stack memory to user-space.
(CVE-2012-6547, Low)

* An information leak in the Bluetooth implementation could allow a local

user who has the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to leak kernel stack memory to
user-space. (CVE-2013-0349, Low)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the tmpfs implementation. A local user

able to mount and unmount a tmpfs file system could use this flaw to cause
a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their privileges.
(CVE-2013-1767, Low)

* A NULL pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel's USB Inside Out

Edgeport Serial Driver implementation. An attacker with physical access to
a system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-1774,
Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Andrew Honig of Google for reporting
CVE-2013-1796, CVE-2013-1797, and CVE-2013-1798. CVE-2013-1792 was
discovered by Mateusz Guzik of Red Hat EMEA GSS SEG Team.

## Solution

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

# USN-1829-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities

16 May 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's ISO

9660 CDROM file system driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to

examine some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6549](/security/CVE-2012-6549))

Mathias Krause discovered a flaw in xfrm\_user in the Linux kernel. A local

attacker with NET\_ADMIN capability could potentially exploit this flaw to

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2013-1826](/security/CVE-2013-1826))

A buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux Kernel's USB subsystem for

devices reporting the cdc-wdm class. A specially crafted USB device when

plugged-in could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-1860](/security/CVE-2013-1860))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's /dev/dvb device. A

local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from the

kernel's stack memory. ([CVE-2013-1928](/security/CVE-2013-1928))

An information leak in the Linux kernel's dcb netlink interface was

discovered. A local user could obtain sensitive information by examining

kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-2634](/security/CVE-2013-2634))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-352-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-352.65](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-352.65)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Convert properly UTF-8 to UTF-16
commit fd3ba42c76d3d4b776120c2b24c1791e7bb3deb1 upstream.
wchar\_t is currently 16bit so converting a utf8 encoded characters not
in plane 0 (>= 0x10000) to wchar\_t (that is calling char2uni) lead to a
-EINVAL return. This patch detect utf8 in cifs\_strtoUTF16 and add special
code calling utf8s\_to\_utf16s.

JFFS2: don't fail on bitflips in OOB
commit 74d83beaa229aac7d126ac1ed9414658ff1a89d2 upstream.
JFFS2 was designed without thought for OOB bitflips, it seems, but they
can occur and will be reported to JFFS2 via mtd\_read\_oob()[1]. We don't
want to fail on these transactions, since the data was corrected.
[1] Few drivers report bitflips for OOB-only transactions. With such
drivers, this patch should have no effect.

JFFS2: fix unmount regression
commit a445f784ae5558a3da680aa6b39ed53c95a551c1 upstream.
This patch fixes regression introduced by
"8bdc81c jffs2: get rid of jffs2\_sync\_super". We submit a delayed work in order
to make sure the write-buffer is synchronized at some point. But we do not
flush it when we unmount, which causes an oops when we unmount the file-system
and then the delayed work is executed.
This patch fixes the issue by adding a "cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync()" infocation
in the '->sync\_fs()' handler. This will make sure the delayed work is canceled
on sync, unmount and re-mount. And because VFS always callse 'sync\_fs()' before
unmounting or remounting, this fixes the issue.

mmc: sh-mmcif: avoid oops on spurious interrupts
commit 8464dd52d3198dd05cafb005371d76e5339eb842 upstream.
On some systems, e.g., kzm9g, MMCIF interfaces can produce spurious
interrupts without any active request. To prevent the Oops, that results
in such cases, don't dereference the mmc request pointer until we make
sure, that we are indeed processing such a request.

mmc: omap\_hsmmc: Pass on the suspend failure to the PM core
commit c4c8eeb4df00aabb641553d6fbcd46f458e56cd9 upstream.
In some cases mmc\_suspend\_host() is not able to claim the
host and proceed with the suspend process. The core returns
-EBUSY to the host controller driver. Unfortunately, the
host controller driver does not pass on this information
to the PM core and hence the system suspend process continues.
ret = mmc\_suspend\_host(host->mmc);
if (ret) {
host->suspended = 0;
if (host->pdata->resume) {
ret = host->pdata->resume(dev, host->slot\_id);
The return status from mmc\_suspend\_host() is overwritten by return
status from host->pdata->resume. So the original return status is lost.
In these cases the MMC core gets to an unexpected state
during resume and multiple issues related to MMC crop up.
1. Host controller driver starts accessing the device registers
before the clocks are enabled which leads to a prefetch abort.
2. A file copy thread which was launched before suspend gets
stuck due to the host not being reclaimed during resume.
To avoid such problems pass on the -EBUSY status to the PM core
from the host controller driver. With this change, MMC core
suspend might still fail but it does not end up making the
system unusable. Suspend gets aborted and the user can try
suspending the system again.

mtd: omap2: fix module loading
commit 4d3d688da8e7016f15483e9319b41311e1db9515 upstream.
Unloading the omap2 nand driver missed to release the memory region which will
result in not being able to request it again if one want to load the driver
later on.
This patch fixes following error when loading omap2 module after unloading:
---8<---
~ $ rmmod omap2
~ $ modprobe omap2
[ 37.420928] omap2-nand: probe of omap2-nand.0 failed with error -16

mtd: mtdpart: break it as soon as we parse out the partitions
commit c51803ddba10d80d9f246066802c6e359cf1d44c upstream.
We may cause a memory leak when the @types has more then one parser.
Take the `default\_mtd\_part\_types` for example. The default\_mtd\_part\_types has
two parsers now: `cmdlinepart` and `ofpart`.
Assume the following case:
The kernel command line sets the partitions like:
#gpmi-nand:20m(boot),20m(kernel),1g(rootfs),-(user)
But the devicetree file(such as arch/arm/boot/dts/imx28-evk.dts) also sets
the same partitions as the kernel command line does.
In the current code, the partitions parsed out by the `ofpart` will
overwrite the @pparts which has already set by the `cmdlinepart` parser,
and the the partitions parsed out by the `cmdlinepart` is missed.
A memory leak occurs.
So we should break the code as soon as we parse out the partitions,
In actually, this patch makes a priority order between the parsers.
If one parser has already parsed out the partitions successfully,
it's no need to use another parser anymore.

CPU hotplug, cpusets, suspend: Don't modify cpusets during suspend/resume
commit d35be8bab9b0ce44bed4b9453f86ebf64062721e upstream.
In the event of CPU hotplug, the kernel modifies the cpusets' cpus\_allowed
masks as and when necessary to ensure that the tasks belonging to the cpusets
have some place (online CPUs) to run on. And regular CPU hotplug is
destructive in the sense that the kernel doesn't remember the original cpuset
configurations set by the user, across hotplug operations.
However, suspend/resume (which uses CPU hotplug) is a special case in which
the kernel has the responsibility to restore the system (during resume), to
exactly the same state it was in before suspend.
In order to achieve that, do the following:
1. Don't modify cpusets during suspend/resume. At all.
In particular, don't move the tasks from one cpuset to another, and
don't modify any cpuset's cpus\_allowed mask. So, simply ignore cpusets
during the CPU hotplug operations that are carried out in the
suspend/resume path.
2. However, cpusets and sched domains are related. We just want to avoid
altering cpusets alone. So, to keep the sched domains updated, build
a single sched domain (containing all active cpus) during each of the
CPU hotplug operations carried out in s/r path, effectively ignoring
the cpusets' cpus\_allowed masks.
(Since userspace is frozen while doing all this, it will go unnoticed.)
3. During the last CPU online operation during resume, build the sched
domains by looking up the (unaltered) cpusets' cpus\_allowed masks.
That will bring back the system to the same original state as it was in
before suspend.
Ultimately, this will not only solve the cpuset problem related to suspend
resume (ie., restores the cpusets to exactly what it was before suspend, by
not touching it at all) but also speeds up suspend/resume because we avoid
running cpuset update code for every CPU being offlined/onlined.

mempolicy: fix a memory corruption by refcount imbalance in alloc\_pages\_vma()
commit 00442ad04a5eac08a98255697c510e708f6082e2 upstream.
Commit cc9a6c877661 ("cpuset: mm: reduce large amounts of memory barrier
related damage v3") introduced a potential memory corruption.
shmem\_alloc\_page() uses a pseudo vma and it has one significant unique
combination, vma->vm\_ops=NULL and vma->policy->flags & MPOL\_F\_SHARED.
get\_vma\_policy() does NOT increase a policy ref when vma->vm\_ops=NULL
and mpol\_cond\_put() DOES decrease a policy ref when a policy has
MPOL\_F\_SHARED. Therefore, when a cpuset update race occurs,
alloc\_pages\_vma() falls in 'goto retry\_cpuset' path, decrements the
reference count and frees the policy prematurely.

When shared\_policy\_replace() fails to allocate new->policy is not freed

it is easy to make a mistake.
This patch creates an sp\_free wrapper function and uses it. The bug was

mempolicy: fix a race in shared\_policy\_replace()
commit b22d127a39ddd10d93deee3d96e643657ad53a49 upstream.
shared\_policy\_replace() use of sp\_alloc() is unsafe. 1) sp\_node cannot
be dereferenced if sp->lock is not held and 2) another thread can modify
sp\_node between spin\_unlock for allocating a new sp node and next
spin\_lock. The bug was introduced before 2.6.12-rc2.
Kosaki's original patch for this problem was to allocate an sp node and
policy within shared\_policy\_replace and initialise it when the lock is
reacquired. I was not keen on this approach because it partially
duplicates sp\_alloc(). As the paths were sp->lock is taken are not that
performance critical this patch converts sp->lock to sp->mutex so it can
sleep when calling sp\_alloc().

The problem is that the structure is being prematurely freed due to a
reference count imbalance. In the following case mbind(addr, len) should
replace the memory policies of both vma1 and vma2 and thus they will
become to share the same mempolicy and the new mempolicy will have the
MPOL\_F\_SHARED flag.
+-------------------+-------------------+
| vma1 | vma2(shmem) |
+-------------------+-------------------+
| |
addr addr+len
alloc\_pages\_vma() uses get\_vma\_policy() and mpol\_cond\_put() pair for
maintaining the mempolicy reference count. The current rule is that
get\_vma\_policy() only increments refcount for shmem VMA and
mpol\_conf\_put() only decrements refcount if the policy has
MPOL\_F\_SHARED.
In above case, vma1 is not shmem vma and vma->policy has MPOL\_F\_SHARED!
The reference count will be decreased even though was not increased
whenever alloc\_page\_vma() is called. This has been broken since commit
[52cd3b07: mempolicy: rework mempolicy Reference Counting] in 2008.
There is another serious bug with the sharing of memory policies.
Currently, mempolicy rebind logic (it is called from cpuset rebinding)
ignores a refcount of mempolicy and override it forcibly. Thus, any
mempolicy sharing may cause mempolicy corruption. The bug was
introduced by commit [68860ec1: cpusets: automatic numa mempolicy
rebinding].
Ideally, the shared policy handling would be rewritten to either
properly handle COW of the policy structures or at least reference count
MPOL\_F\_SHARED based exclusively on information within the policy.
However, this patch takes the easier approach of disabling any policy
sharing between VMAs. Each new range allocated with sp\_alloc will
allocate a new policy, set the reference count to 1 and drop the
reference count of the old policy. This increases the memory footprint
but is not expected to be a major problem as mbind() is unlikely to be
used for fine-grained ranges. It is also inefficient because it means
we allocate a new policy even in cases where mbind\_range() could use the
new\_policy passed to it. However, it is more straight-forward and the
change should be invisible to the user.

rcu: Fix day-one dyntick-idle stall-warning bug
commit a10d206ef1a83121ab7430cb196e0376a7145b22 upstream.
Each grace period is supposed to have at least one callback waiting
for that grace period to complete. However, if CONFIG\_NO\_HZ=n, an
extra callback-free grace period is no big problem -- it will chew up
a tiny bit of CPU time, but it will complete normally. In contrast,
CONFIG\_NO\_HZ=y kernels have the potential for all the CPUs to go to
sleep indefinitely, in turn indefinitely delaying completion of the
callback-free grace period. Given that nothing is waiting on this grace
period, this is also not a problem.
That is, unless RCU CPU stall warnings are also enabled, as they are
in recent kernels. In this case, if a CPU wakes up after at least one
minute of inactivity, an RCU CPU stall warning will result. The reason
that no one noticed until quite recently is that most systems have enough
OS noise that they will never remain absolutely idle for a full minute.
But there are some embedded systems with cut-down userspace configurations
that consistently get into this situation.
All this begs the question of exactly how a callback-free grace period
gets started in the first place. This can happen due to the fact that
CPUs do not necessarily agree on which grace period is in progress.
If a CPU still believes that the grace period that just completed is
still ongoing, it will believe that it has callbacks that need to wait for
another grace period, never mind the fact that the grace period that they
were waiting for just completed. This CPU can therefore erroneously
decide to start a new grace period. Note that this can happen in
TREE\_RCU and TREE\_PREEMPT\_RCU even on a single-CPU system: Deadlock
considerations mean that the CPU that detected the end of the grace
period is not necessarily officially informed of this fact for some time.
Once this CPU notices that the earlier grace period completed, it will
invoke its callbacks. It then won't have any callbacks left. If no
other CPU has any callbacks, we now have a callback-free grace period.
This commit therefore makes CPUs check more carefully before starting a
new grace period. This new check relies on an array of tail pointers
into each CPU's list of callbacks. If the CPU is up to date on which
grace periods have completed, it checks to see if any callbacks follow
the RCU\_DONE\_TAIL segment, otherwise it checks to see if any callbacks
follow the RCU\_WAIT\_TAIL segment. The reason that this works is that
the RCU\_WAIT\_TAIL segment will be promoted to the RCU\_DONE\_TAIL segment
as soon as the CPU is officially notified that the old grace period
has ended.
This change is to cpu\_needs\_another\_gp(), which is called in a number
of places. The only one that really matters is in rcu\_start\_gp(), where
the root rcu\_node structure's ->lock is held, which prevents any
other CPU from starting or completing a grace period, so that the
comparison that determines whether the CPU is missing the completion
of a grace period is stable.

score: Add missing RCU idle APIs on idle loop
commit 0ee23fda59740767324b4340247ca41a2f498ca6 upstream.
In the old times, the whole idle task was considered
as an RCU quiescent state. But as RCU became more and
more successful overtime, some RCU read side critical
section have been added even in the code of some
architectures idle tasks, for tracing for example.
So nowadays, rcu\_idle\_enter() and rcu\_idle\_exit() must
be called by the architecture to tell RCU about the part
in the idle loop that doesn't make use of rcu read side
critical sections, typically the part that puts the CPU
in low power mode.
This is necessary for RCU to find the quiescent states in
idle in order to complete grace periods.
Add this missing pair of calls in scores's idle loop.

ia64: Add missing RCU idle APIs on idle loop
commit 93482f4ef1093f5961a63359a34612183d6beea0 upstream.
Traditionally, the entire idle task served as an RCU quiescent state.
But when RCU read side critical sections started appearing within the
idle loop, this traditional strategy became untenable. The fix was to
create new RCU APIs named rcu\_idle\_enter() and rcu\_idle\_exit(), which
must be called by each architecture's idle loop so that RCU can tell
when it is safe to ignore a given idle CPU.
Unfortunately, this fix was never applied to ia64, a shortcoming remedied
by this commit.

but all the pch platform irq handlers get is wrong. Hooray for copy&

Currently this gets papered over by a gross hack in finish\_page\_flip.

drm/i915: Flush the pending flips on the CRTC before modification
commit 5bb61643f6a70d48de9cfe91ad0fee0d618b6816 upstream.
This was meant to be the purpose of the
intel\_crtc\_wait\_for\_pending\_flips() function which is called whilst
preparing the CRTC for a modeset or before disabling. However, as Ville
Syrjala pointed out, we set the pending flip notification on the old
framebuffer that is no longer attached to the CRTC by the time we come
to flush the pending operations. Instead, we can simply wait on the
pending unpin work to be finished on this CRTC, knowning that the
hardware has therefore finished modifying the registers, before proceeding
with our direct access.
Fixes i-g-t/flip\_test on non-pch platforms. pch platforms simply
schedule the flip immediately when the pipe is disabled, leading
to other funny issues.

MIPS: ath79: use correct fractional dividers for {CPU,DDR}\_PLL on AR934x
commit 65fc7f9957c52ad4fdf4ee5dfe3a75aa0a633d39 upstream.
The current dividers in the code are wrong and this
leads to broken CPU frequency calculation on boards
where the fractional part is used.
For example, if the SoC is running from a 40MHz
reference clock, refdiv=1, nint=14, outdiv=0 and
nfrac=31 the real frequency is 579.375MHz but the
current code calculates 569.687MHz instead.
Because the system time is indirectly related to
the CPU frequency the broken computation causes
drift in the system time.
The correct divider is 2^6 for the CPU PLL and 2^10
for the DDR PLL. Use the correct values to fix the
issue.

mm: thp: fix pmd\_present for split\_huge\_page and PROT\_NONE with THP
commit 027ef6c87853b0a9df53175063028edb4950d476 upstream.
In many places !pmd\_present has been converted to pmd\_none. For pmds
that's equivalent and pmd\_none is quicker so using pmd\_none is better.
However (unless we delete pmd\_present) we should provide an accurate
pmd\_present too. This will avoid the risk of code thinking the pmd is non
present because it's under \_\_split\_huge\_page\_map, see the pmd\_mknotpresent
there and the comment above it.
If the page has been mprotected as PROT\_NONE, it would also lead to a
pmd\_present false negative in the same way as the race with
split\_huge\_page.
Because the PSE bit stays on at all times (both during split\_huge\_page and
when the \_PAGE\_PROTNONE bit get set), we could only check for the PSE bit,
but checking the PROTNONE bit too is still good to remember pmd\_present
must always keep PROT\_NONE into account.
This explains a not reproducible BUG\_ON that was seldom reported on the
lists.
The same issue is in pmd\_large, it would go wrong with both PROT\_NONE and
if it races with split\_huge\_page.

mm: fix invalidate\_complete\_page2() lock ordering
commit ec4d9f626d5908b6052c2973f37992f1db52e967 upstream.
In fuzzing with trinity, lockdep protested "possible irq lock inversion
dependency detected" when isolate\_lru\_page() reenabled interrupts while
still holding the supposedly irq-safe tree\_lock:
invalidate\_inode\_pages2
invalidate\_complete\_page2
spin\_lock\_irq(&mapping->tree\_lock)
clear\_page\_mlock
isolate\_lru\_page
spin\_unlock\_irq(&zone->lru\_lock)
isolate\_lru\_page() is correct to enable interrupts unconditionally:
invalidate\_complete\_page2() is incorrect to call clear\_page\_mlock() while
holding tree\_lock, which is supposed to nest inside lru\_lock.
Both truncate\_complete\_page() and invalidate\_complete\_page() call
clear\_page\_mlock() before taking tree\_lock to remove page from radix\_tree.
I guess invalidate\_complete\_page2() preferred to test PageDirty (again)
under tree\_lock before committing to the munlock; but since the page has
already been unmapped, its state is already somewhat inconsistent, and no
worse if clear\_page\_mlock() moved up.

hugetlb: do not use vma\_hugecache\_offset() for vma\_prio\_tree\_foreach
commit 36e4f20af833d1ce196e6a4ade05dc26c44652d1 upstream.
Commit 0c176d52b0b2 ("mm: hugetlb: fix pgoff computation when unmapping
page from vma") fixed pgoff calculation but it has replaced it by
vma\_hugecache\_offset() which is not approapriate for offsets used for
vma\_prio\_tree\_foreach() because that one expects index in page units
rather than in huge\_page\_shift.
Johannes said:
: The resulting index may not be too big, but it can be too small: assume
: hpage size of 2M and the address to unmap to be 0x200000. This is regular
: page index 512 and hpage index 1. If you have a VMA that maps the file
: only starting at the second huge page, that VMAs vm\_pgoff will be 512 but
: you ask for offset 1 and miss it even though it does map the page of
: interest. hugetlb\_cow() will try to unmap, miss the vma, and retry the
: cow until the allocation succeeds or the skipped vma(s) go away.

commit 7a71932d5676b7410ab64d149bad8bde6b0d8632 upstream.
KPF\_THP can be set on non-huge compound pages (like slab pages or pages
allocated by drivers with \_\_GFP\_COMP) because PageTransCompound only
checks PG\_head and PG\_tail. Obviously this is a bug and breaks user space
applications which look for thp via /proc/kpageflags.

xfrm\_user: ensure user supplied esn replay window is valid
commit ecd7918745234e423dd87fcc0c077da557909720 upstream.
The current code fails to ensure that the netlink message actually
contains as many bytes as the header indicates. If a user creates a new
state or updates an existing one but does not supply the bytes for the
whole ESN replay window, the kernel copies random heap bytes into the
replay bitmap, the ones happen to follow the XFRMA\_REPLAY\_ESN\_VAL
netlink attribute. This leads to following issues:
1. The replay window has random bits set confusing the replay handling
code later on.
2. A malicious user could use this flaw to leak up to ~3.5kB of heap
memory when she has access to the XFRM netlink interface (requires
CAP\_NET\_ADMIN).
Known users of the ESN replay window are strongSwan and Steffen's
iproute2 patch (). The latter
uses the interface with a bitmap supplied while the former does not.
strongSwan is therefore prone to run into issue 1.
To fix both issues without breaking existing userland allow using the
XFRMA\_REPLAY\_ESN\_VAL netlink attribute with either an empty bitmap or a
fully specified one. For the former case we initialize the in-kernel
bitmap with zero, for the latter we copy the user supplied bitmap. For
state updates the full bitmap must be supplied.
To prevent overflows in the bitmap length calculation the maximum size
of bmp\_len is limited to 128 by this patch -- resulting in a maximum
replay window of 4096 packets. This should be sufficient for all real
life scenarios (RFC 4303 recommends a default replay window size of 64).

ext4: fix fdatasync() for files with only i\_size changes
commit b71fc079b5d8f42b2a52743c8d2f1d35d655b1c5 upstream.
Code tracking when transaction needs to be committed on fdatasync(2) forgets
to handle a situation when only inode's i\_size is changed. Thus in such
situations fdatasync(2) doesn't force transaction with new i\_size to disk
and that can result in wrong i\_size after a crash.
Fix the issue by updating inode's i\_datasync\_tid whenever its size is
updated.

ext4: fix potential deadlock in ext4\_nonda\_switch()
commit 00d4e7362ed01987183e9528295de3213031309c upstream.
In ext4\_nonda\_switch(), if the file system is getting full we used to
call writeback\_inodes\_sb\_if\_idle(). The problem is that we can be
holding i\_mutex already, and this causes a potential deadlock when
writeback\_inodes\_sb\_if\_idle() when it tries to take s\_umount. (See
lockdep output below).
As it turns out we don't need need to hold s\_umount; the fact that we
are in the middle of the write(2) system call will keep the superblock
pinned. Unfortunately writeback\_inodes\_sb() checks to make sure
s\_umount is taken, and the VFS uses a different mechanism for making
sure the file system doesn't get unmounted out from under us. The
simplest way of dealing with this is to just simply grab s\_umount
using a trylock, and skip kicking the writeback flusher thread in the
very unlikely case that we can't take a read lock on s\_umount without
blocking.
Also, we now check the cirteria for kicking the writeback thread
before we decide to whether to fall back to non-delayed writeback, so
if there are any outstanding delayed allocation writes, we try to get
them resolved as soon as possible.

"pci=assign-busses" does).
We don't discover all the devices on the Intel DP43BF motherboard

SCSI: zfcp: only access zfcp\_scsi\_dev for valid scsi\_device
commit d436de8ce25f53a8a880a931886821f632247943 upstream.
\_\_scsi\_remove\_device (e.g. due to dev\_loss\_tmo) calls
zfcp\_scsi\_slave\_destroy which in turn sends a close LUN FSF request to
the adapter. After 30 seconds without response,
zfcp\_erp\_timeout\_handler kicks the ERP thread failing the close LUN
ERP action. zfcp\_erp\_wait in zfcp\_erp\_lun\_shutdown\_wait and thus
zfcp\_scsi\_slave\_destroy returns and then scsi\_device is no longer
valid. Sometime later the response to the close LUN FSF request may
finally come in. However, commit
b62a8d9b45b971a67a0f8413338c230e3117dff5
"[SCSI] zfcp: Use SCSI device data zfcp\_scsi\_dev instead of zfcp\_unit"
introduced a number of attempts to unconditionally access struct
zfcp\_scsi\_dev through struct scsi\_device causing a use-after-free.
This leads to an Oops due to kernel page fault in one of:
zfcp\_fsf\_abort\_fcp\_command\_handler, zfcp\_fsf\_open\_lun\_handler,
zfcp\_fsf\_close\_lun\_handler, zfcp\_fsf\_req\_trace,
zfcp\_fsf\_fcp\_handler\_common.
Move dereferencing of zfcp private data zfcp\_scsi\_dev allocated in
scsi\_device via scsi\_transport\_reserve\_device after the check for
potentially aborted FSF request and thus no longer valid scsi\_device.
Only then assign sdev\_to\_zfcp(sdev) to the local auto variable struct
zfcp\_scsi\_dev \*zfcp\_sdev.

SCSI: zfcp: Do not wakeup while suspended
commit cb45214960bc989af8b911ebd77da541c797717d upstream.
If the mapping of FCP device bus ID and corresponding subchannel
is modified while the Linux image is suspended, the resume of FCP
devices can fail. During resume, zfcp gets callbacks from cio regarding
the modified subchannels but they can be arbitrarily mixed with the
restore/resume callback. Since the cio callbacks would trigger
adapter recovery, zfcp could wakeup before the resume callback.
Therefore, ignore the cio callbacks regarding subchannels while
being suspended. We can safely do so, since zfcp does not deal itself
with subchannels. For problem determination purposes, we still trace the
ignored callback events.
The following kernel messages could be seen on resume:
kernel: : parent  should not be sleeping
As part of adapter reopen recovery, zfcp performs auto port scanning
which can erroneously try to register new remote ports with
scsi\_transport\_fc and the device core code complains about the parent
(adapter) still sleeping.
kernel: zfcp.3dff9c: :\
Setting up the QDIO connection to the FCP adapter failed
kernel: zfcp.574d43: :\
ERP cannot recover an error on the FCP device
In such cases, the adapter gave up recovery and remained blocked along
with its child objects: remote ports and LUNs/scsi devices. Even the
adapter shutdown as part of giving up recovery failed because the ccw
device state remained disconnected. Later, the corresponding remote
ports ran into dev\_loss\_tmo. As a result, the LUNs were erroneously
not available again after resume.
Even a manually triggered adapter recovery (e.g. sysfs attribute
failed, or device offline/online via sysfs) could not recover the
adapter due to the remaining disconnected state of the corresponding
ccw device.

SCSI: zfcp: Bounds checking for deferred error trace
commit 01e60527f0a49b3d7df603010bd6079bb4b6cf07 upstream.
The pl vector has scount elements, i.e. pl[scount-1] is the last valid
element. For maximum sized requests, payload->counter == scount after
the last loop iteration. Therefore, do bounds checking first (with
boolean shortcut) to not access the invalid element pl[scount].
Do not trust the maximum sbale->scount value from the HBA
but ensure we won't access the pl vector out of our allocated bounds.
While at it, clean up scoping and prevent unnecessary memset.

net: do not disable sg for packets requiring no checksum
[ Upstream commit c0d680e577ff171e7b37dbdb1b1bf5451e851f04 ]
A change in a series of VLAN-related changes appears to have
inadvertently disabled the use of the scatter gather feature of
network cards for transmission of non-IP ethernet protocols like ATA
over Ethernet (AoE). Below is a reference to the commit that
introduces a "harmonize\_features" function that turns off scatter
gather when the NIC does not support hardware checksumming for the
ethernet protocol of an sk buff.

net offloading: Generalize netif\_get\_vlan\_features().
The can\_checksum\_protocol function is not equipped to consider a
protocol that does not require checksumming. Calling it for a
protocol that requires no checksum is inappropriate.
The patch below has harmonize\_features call can\_checksum\_protocol when
the protocol needs a checksum, so that the network layer is not forced
to perform unnecessary skb linearization on the transmission of AoE
packets. Unnecessary linearization results in decreased performance
and increased memory pressure, as reported here:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mm/msg15184.html
The problem has probably not been widely experienced yet, because
only recently has the kernel.org-distributed aoe driver acquired the
ability to use payloads of over a page in size, with the patchset
recently included in the mm tree:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/8/28/140
The coraid.com-distributed aoe driver already could use payloads of
greater than a page in size, but its users generally do not use the
newest kernels.

net: small bug on rxhash calculation
[ Upstream commit 6862234238e84648c305526af2edd98badcad1e0 ]
In the current rxhash calculation function, while the
sorting of the ports/addrs is coherent (you get the
same rxhash for packets sharing the same 4-tuple, in
both directions), ports and addrs are sorted
independently. This implies packets from a connection
between the same addresses but crossed ports hash to
the same rxhash.
For example, traffic between A=S:l and B=L:s is hashed
(in both directions) from {L, S, {s, l}}. The same
rxhash is obtained for packets between C=S:s and D=L:l.
This patch ensures that you either swap both addrs and ports,
or you swap none. Traffic between A and B, and traffic
between C and D, get their rxhash from different sources
({L, S, {l, s}} for A<->B, and {L, S, {s, l}} for C<->D)

sctp: Don't charge for data in sndbuf again when transmitting packet
[ Upstream commit 4c3a5bdae293f75cdf729c6c00124e8489af2276 ]
SCTP charges wmem\_alloc via sctp\_set\_owner\_w() in sctp\_sendmsg() and via
skb\_set\_owner\_w() in sctp\_packet\_transmit(). If a sender runs out of
sndbuf it will sleep in sctp\_wait\_for\_sndbuf() and expects to be waken up
by \_\_sctp\_write\_space().
Buffer space charged via sctp\_set\_owner\_w() is released in sctp\_wfree()
which calls \_\_sctp\_write\_space() directly.
Buffer space charged via skb\_set\_owner\_w() is released via sock\_wfree()
which calls sk->sk\_write\_space() \_if\_ SOCK\_USE\_WRITE\_QUEUE is not set.
sctp\_endpoint\_init() sets SOCK\_USE\_WRITE\_QUEUE on all sockets.
Therefore if sctp\_packet\_transmit() manages to queue up more than sndbuf
bytes, sctp\_wait\_for\_sndbuf() will never be woken up again unless it is
interrupted by a signal.
This could be fixed by clearing the SOCK\_USE\_WRITE\_QUEUE flag but ...
Charging for the data twice does not make sense in the first place, it
leads to overcharging sndbuf by a factor 2. Therefore this patch only
charges a single byte in wmem\_alloc when transmitting an SCTP packet to
ensure that the socket stays alive until the packet has been released.
This means that control chunks are no longer accounted for in wmem\_alloc
which I believe is not a problem as skb->truesize will typically lead
to overcharging anyway and thus compensates for any control overhead.

window can be still zero while sk\_async\_wait\_queue exhausts
enough space to keep it zero. As this queue isn't cleaned until
the tcp\_service\_net\_dma() call, sk\_wait\_data() cannot receive
any data and blocks forever.

characterized by a higher value of the ratio
max\_class\_pkt/weight\_of\_the\_class with respect to that of

netxen: check for root bus in netxen\_mask\_aer\_correctable
[ Upstream commit e4d1aa40e363ed3e0486aeeeb0d173f7f822737e ]
Add a check if pdev->bus->self == NULL (root bus). When attaching
a netxen NIC to a VM it can be on the root bus and the guest would
crash in netxen\_mask\_aer\_correctable() because of a NULL pointer
dereference if CONFIG\_PCIEAER is present.

This was previously hidden because ixp4xx\_hss includes linux/hdlc.h which
includes linux/netdevice.h which includes linux/netprio\_cgroup.h which
used to include linux/module.h. The real issue was actually present since
the initial commit that added this driver since it uses macros from

xfrm: Workaround incompatibility of ESN and async crypto
[ Upstream commit 3b59df46a449ec9975146d71318c4777ad086744 ]
ESN for esp is defined in RFC 4303. This RFC assumes that the
sequence number counters are always up to date. However,
this is not true if an async crypto algorithm is employed.
If the sequence number counters are not up to date on sequence
number check, we may incorrectly update the upper 32 bit of
the sequence number. This leads to a DOS.
We workaround this by comparing the upper sequence number,
(used for authentication) with the upper sequence number
computed after the async processing. We drop the packet
if these numbers are different.
To do this, we introduce a recheck function that does this
check in the ESN case.

regression for IPv6. Rx checksum offload does not work. IPv6 packets
are passed to the stack with CHECKSUM\_NONE.
The hardware obviously cannot perform IP checksum validation for IPv6,
because there is no checksum in the IPv6 header. This should not prevent
us from setting CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY.

workqueue: add missing smp\_wmb() in process\_one\_work()
commit 959d1af8cffc8fd38ed53e8be1cf4ab8782f9c00 upstream.
WORK\_STRUCT\_PENDING is used to claim ownership of a work item and
process\_one\_work() releases it before starting execution. When
someone else grabs PENDING, all pre-release updates to the work item
should be visible and all updates made by the new owner should happen
afterwards.
Grabbing PENDING uses test\_and\_set\_bit() and thus has a full barrier;
however, clearing doesn't have a matching wmb. Given the preceding
spin\_unlock and use of clear\_bit, I don't believe this can be a
problem on an actual machine and there hasn't been any related report
but it still is theretically possible for clear\_pending to permeate
upwards and happen before work->entry update.
Add an explicit smp\_wmb() before work\_clear\_pending().

powerpc/eeh: Fix crash on converting OF node to edev
commit 1e38b7140185e384da216aff66a711df09b5afc9 upstream.
The kernel crash was reported by Alexy. He was testing some feature
with private kernel, in which Alexy added some code in pci\_pm\_reset()
to read the CSR after writting it. The bug could be reproduced on
Fiber Channel card (Fibre Channel: Emulex Corporation Saturn-X:
LightPulse Fibre Channel Host Adapter (rev 03)) by the following
commands.
# echo 1 > /sys/devices/pci0004:01/0004:01:00.0/reset
# rmmod lpfc
# modprobe lpfc
The history behind the test case is that those additional config
space reading operations in pci\_pm\_reset() would cause EEH error,
but we didn't detect EEH error until "modprobe lpfc". For the case,
all the PCI devices on PCI bus (0004:01) were removed and added after
PE reset. Then the EEH devices would be figured out again based on
the OF nodes. Unfortunately, there were some child OF nodes under
PCI device (0004:01:00.0), but they didn't have attached PCI\_DN since
they're invisible from PCI domain. However, we were still trying to
convert OF node to EEH device without checking on the attached PCI\_DN.
Eventually, it caused the kernel crash as follows:

drivers/scsi/atp870u.c: fix bad use of udelay
commit 0f6d93aa9d96cc9022b51bd10d462b03296be146 upstream.
The ACARD driver calls udelay() with a value > 2000, which leads to to
the following compilation error on ARM:
ERROR: "\_\_bad\_udelay" [drivers/scsi/atp870u.ko] undefined!
make[1]: \*\*\* [\_\_modpost] Error 1
This is because udelay is defined on ARM, roughly speaking, as
#define udelay(n) ((n) > 2000 ? \_\_bad\_udelay() : \
\_\_const\_udelay((n) \* ((2199023U\*HZ)>>11)))
The argument to \_\_const\_udelay is the number of jiffies to wait divided
by 4, but this does not work unless the multiplication does not
overflow, and that is what the build error is designed to prevent. The
intended behavior can be achieved by using mdelay to call udelay
multiple times in a loop.

commit f96972f2dc6365421cf2366ebd61ee4cf060c8d5 upstream.
As kernel\_power\_off() calls disable\_nonboot\_cpus(), we may also want to
have kernel\_restart() call disable\_nonboot\_cpus(). Doing so can help
machines that require boot cpu be the last alive cpu during reboot to
survive with kernel restart.
This fixes one reboot issue seen on imx6q (Cortex-A9 Quad). The machine
requires that the restart routine be run on the primary cpu rather than
secondary ones. Otherwise, the secondary core running the restart
routine will fail to come to online after reboot.

bit integer had been valid. This makes it impossible to add IO resources
as the added range is smaller than that of the root resource for IO ports.
Since we're not really using IO memory at all fix this by defining our
own root resource outside the normal tree and make that the parent of
all IO resources. This also ensures we won't conflict with read IO ports
if we ever run on a platform which happens to use them.

PCI: acpiphp: check whether \_ADR evaluation succeeded
commit dfb117b3e50c52c7b3416db4a4569224b8db80bb upstream.
Check whether we evaluated \_ADR successfully. Previously we ignored
failure, so we would have used garbage data from the stack as the device
and function number.
We return AE\_OK so that we ignore only this slot and continue looking
for other slots.

commit 4b961180ef275035b1538317ffd0e21e80e63e77 upstream.
ite\_dev::rdev is currently initialised in ite\_probe() after
rc\_register\_device() returns. If a newly registered device is opened
quickly enough, we may enable interrupts and try to use ite\_dev::rdev
before it has been initialised. Move it up to the earliest point we
can, right after calling rc\_allocate\_device().

em28xx: Make all em28xx extensions to be initialized asynchronously

em28xx-dvb, em28xx-alsa and em28xx-ir are typically initialized
asyncrhronously. The exception for it is when those modules
are loaded before em28xx (or before an em28xx card insertion) or
when they're built in.
Make the extentions to always load asynchronously. That allows
having all DVB firmwares loaded synchronously with udev-182.

ARM: 7548/1: include linux/sched.h in syscall.h
commit 8ef102c6b4bc996ff96ca52b34775fe931ec90c9 upstream.
The syscall tracing patch introduces a compile bug in lttng-modules
when the latter calls syscall\_get\_nr(), similar to the following:
/arch/arm/include/asm/syscall.h:21:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'task\_thread\_info' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
The issue is that we are using task\_thread\_info() in the
syscall\_get\_nr() function in asm/syscall.h, but not explicitly
including sched.h from this file, so we can expect this bug might
surface any time that syscall\_get\_nr() is called.
Explicitly including sched.h solves the problem.

intel-iommu: Default to non-coherent for domains unattached to iommus
commit 2e12bc29fc5a12242d68e11875db3dd58efad9ff upstream.
domain\_update\_iommu\_coherency() currently defaults to setting domains
as coherent when the domain is not attached to any iommus. This
allows for a window in domain\_context\_mapping\_one() where such a
domain can update context entries non-coherently, and only after
update the domain capability to clear iommu\_coherency.
This can be seen using KVM device assignment on VT-d systems that
do not support coherency in the ecap register. When a device is
added to a guest, a domain is created (iommu\_coherency = 0), the
device is attached, and ranges are mapped. If we then hot unplug
the device, the coherency is updated and set to the default (1)
since no iommus are attached to the domain. A subsequent attach
of a device makes use of the same dmar domain (now marked coherent)
updates context entries with coherency enabled, and only disables
coherency as the last step in the process.
To fix this, switch domain\_update\_iommu\_coherency() to use the
safer, non-coherent default for domains not attached to iommus.

slab: fix the DEADLOCK issue on l3 alien lock
commit 947ca1856a7e60aa6d20536785e6a42dff25aa6e upstream.
DEADLOCK will be report while running a kernel with NUMA and LOCKDEP enabled,
the process of this fake report is:
kmem\_cache\_free() //free obj in cachep
-> cache\_free\_alien() //acquire cachep's l3 alien lock
-> \_\_drain\_alien\_cache()
-> free\_block()
-> slab\_destroy()
-> kmem\_cache\_free() //free slab in cachep->slabp\_cache
-> cache\_free\_alien() //acquire cachep->slabp\_cache's l3 alien lock
Since the cachep and cachep->slabp\_cache's l3 alien are in the same lock class,
fake report generated.
This should not happen since we already have init\_lock\_keys() which will
reassign the lock class for both l3 list and l3 alien.
However, init\_lock\_keys() was invoked at a wrong position which is before we
invoke enable\_cpucache() on each cache.
Since until set slab\_state to be FULL, we won't invoke enable\_cpucache()
on caches to build their l3 alien while creating them, so although we invoked
init\_lock\_keys(), the l3 alien lock class won't change since we don't have
them until invoked enable\_cpucache() later.
This patch will invoke init\_lock\_keys() after we done enable\_cpucache()
instead of before to avoid the fake DEADLOCK report.
Michael traced the problem back to a commit in release 3.0.0:

kbuild: Fix gcc -x syntax
commit b1e0d8b70fa31821ebca3965f2ef8619d7c5e316 upstream.
The correct syntax for gcc -x is "gcc -x assembler", not
"gcc -xassembler". Even though the latter happens to work, the former
is what is documented in the manual page and thus what gcc wrappers
such as icecream do expect.
This isn't a cosmetic change. The missing space prevents icecream from
recognizing compilation tasks it can't handle, leading to silent kernel
miscompilations.
Besides me, credits go to Michael Matz and Dirk Mueller for
investigating the miscompilation issue and tracking it down to this
incorrect -x parameter syntax.

kbuild: make: fix if\_changed when command contains backslashes
commit c353acba28fb3fa1fd05fd6b85a9fc7938330f9c upstream.
The call if\_changed mechanism does not work when the command contains
backslashes. This basically is an issue with lzo and bzip2 compressed
kernels. The compressed binaries do not contain the uncompressed image
size, so these use size\_append to append the size. This results in
backslashes in the executed command. With this if\_changed always
detects a change in the command and rebuilds the compressed image even
if nothing has changed.
Fix this by escaping backslashes in make-cmd

xfrm\_user: return error pointer instead of NULL

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/864745d291b5ba80ea0bd0edcbe67273de368836)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
When dump_one_state() returns an error, e.g. because of a too small
buffer to dump the whole xfrm state, xfrm_state_netlink() returns NULL
instead of an error pointer. But its callers expect an error pointer
and therefore continue to operate on a NULL skbuff.

This could lead to a privilege escalation (execution of user code in
kernel context) if the attacker has CAP_NET_ADMIN and is able to map
address 0.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=920471#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-03-12 08:03:42 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with Direct Rendering Manager(DRM) i915 driver for the the Direct Rendering Infrastructure(DRI) introduced by XFree86 4.0, is vulnerable to a heap overflow flaw.  An user/program with access to the DRM driver could use this flaw to crash the kernel, resulting in DoS or possibly escalate privileges.
