{
  "CVE-2013-1826": {
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference in the XFRM implementation could allow a local user who has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to cause a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check in the XFRM implementation where a NULL pointer could be returned instead of an error pointer, which can then be dereferenced, leading to a crash.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service, system crash",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
   "Required capabilities": [
      "CAP_NET_ADMIN capability"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The issue occurs in the `xfrm_state_netlink` function when `dump_one_state()` returns an error (e.g., due to a small buffer), resulting in a NULL pointer rather than an error pointer. This can cause the caller to attempt to operate on a null sk_buff, leading to a crash."
