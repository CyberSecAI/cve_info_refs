Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (wIPS) of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC). Specifically, the wIPS is susceptible to a denial of service attack due to improperly handled crafted IP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of crafted IP packets by the wIPS component of the WLC.
- Lack of proper input validation or filtering of network traffic by the wIPS, leading to resource exhaustion and device reload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition, causing the affected Cisco WLC device to reload, disrupting wireless network services. This can result in temporary loss of network connectivity, impacting connected clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
- Attackers can send crafted IP packets to vulnerable WLCs.
- Exploitation can originate from both wired and wireless network segments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers do not require authentication.
- They need to be able to send network traffic to the affected WLC, either directly over the wired network or indirectly via a wireless network segment.
- They do not need to be on the same local network segment but simply need network connectivity to send IP packets to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Cisco WLCs with the wIPS feature enabled.
- The vulnerability is identified by Cisco bug ID CSCtx80743.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.8 (Base) and 6.4 (Temporal).

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco WLC Software versions 7.3 prior to 7.3.101.0
- Cisco WLC Software versions 7.2 prior to 7.2.110.0
- Cisco WLC Software version 7.1, all releases
- Cisco WLC Software versions 7.0 prior to 7.0.240.0

**Workarounds:**
- The only listed workaround to mitigate the vulnerability is to disable the wIPS feature on the Cisco WLC.

**Fixed Software:**
- Patches are available in Cisco WLC software versions 7.0.235.0, 7.2.110.0, and 7.3.101.0
