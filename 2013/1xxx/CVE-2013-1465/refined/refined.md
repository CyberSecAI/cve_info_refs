Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1465:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of user-supplied data within the `Cubecart::_basket()` method of the `/classes/cubecart.class.php` file in CubeCart versions 5.0.0 to 5.2.0. Specifically, the application uses `unserialize()` on user-provided input without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is PHP Object Injection, where an attacker can inject malicious serialized PHP objects into the application.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The use of `unserialize()` on untrusted data is the core weakness.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The `$_POST['shipping']` parameter is not sanitized before being used in `unserialize()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Object Injection:** An attacker can inject any PHP object into the application's scope.
- **Configuration Manipulation:**  By injecting a specially crafted `Config` object, an attacker could modify the application's configuration settings which is stored in the database.
- **Secondary Exploitation:** Changes to application settings could pave the way for other attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, or Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a malicious, specially crafted, base64url-encoded serialized string via the `$_POST['shipping']` parameter to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected CubeCart installation.
- No specific privileges are needed. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a request to the shopping cart functionality.
