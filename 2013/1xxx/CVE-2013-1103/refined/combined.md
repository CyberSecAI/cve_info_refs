| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |

DATA + WPS   ```      Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco WLCs and Cisco WiSMs are responsible for system-wide wireless LAN functionality, including security policies, intrusion prevention, RF management, quality of service (QoS), and mobility. These devices communicate with controller-based access points over any Layer 2 (Ethernet) or Layer 3 (IP) infrastructure using the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) and the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol.      The Cisco WLC family of devices is affected by the following vulnerabilities:    Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (wIPS) Denial of Service Vulnerability The Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload by sending crafted IP packets to the affected device. This vulnerability affects Cisco WLCs that are configured with Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (wIPS). This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtx80743](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx80743) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1102. Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service VulnerabilityA denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists on the Cisco Wireless Access Points (AP) that are managed by Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) which could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the AP to reload by sending crafted Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets to the affected device. This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.      This vulnerability can be triggered by transit traffic and even if SIP features are disabled on the device.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCts87659](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts87659) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1103.Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers HTTP Profiling Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityThe HTTP Profiling feature of Cisco WLC devices is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability that may allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device by sending a crafted UserAgent string. This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.      Only Cisco WLC Software version 7.3.101.0 is affected by this vulnerability. A device is vulnerable only if the HTTP Profiling feature is enabled.      To determine if the HTTP Profiling feature is enabled, issue the **show wlan** command and locate the "HTTP" option under the "Network Admission Control"' section. The following example shows the feature enabled:   ```   (WLC)>show wlan 3WLAN Identifier.................................. 3Network Admission Control  Client Profiling Status ....................... Enabled   DHCP ......................................... Disabled   HTTP ......................................... Enabled   ```      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuc15636](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc15636) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1104.   Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers SNMP Unauthorized Access VulnerabilityThe Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by an unauthorized access vulnerability where an authenticated attacker could view and modify the configuration of an affected Cisco WLC via SNMP even if "management over wireless" feature is disabled.   This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCua60653](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua60653) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1105.  Workarounds  * The following section contains information about a workaround, if available, for each vulnerability described in this security advisory.         **Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (wIPS) Denial of Service Vulnerability**There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability besides disabling wIPS features in the Cisco WLC.      **Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability**There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.      **Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers HTTP Profiling Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability besides disabling the HTTP Profiling feature in the Cisco WLC.      **Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers SNMP Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**CPU based Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be configured to restrict SNMP access to the affected WLC. After ACLs are defined, they can be applied to the management interface, the access point manager (AP-manager) interface, or any of the dynamic interfaces for client data traffic or to the Network Processing Unit (NPU) interface for traffic to the controller CPU.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
