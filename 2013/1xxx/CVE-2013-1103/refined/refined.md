Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1103:

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-1103 is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability affecting Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs). It stems from improper handling of crafted Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets by the Wireless Access Points (APs) managed by the WLC.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the WLC's inability to properly process specially crafted SIP packets. This leads to the AP, and not the WLC, reloading itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The core weakness is in how the Cisco Wireless Access Points handle incoming SIP packets. The devices do not properly validate the packets, which allows a crafted packet to trigger a device reload.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is a lack of proper input validation of SIP packets by the affected APs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will cause the affected AP to reload, resulting in a denial of service for the wireless network connected to that AP. This can cause disruptions in network connectivity for wireless clients.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely over the network, making it accessible to attackers from various locations on the network.
*   **Wired or Wireless Segment:** The attack can be performed from both wired and wireless segments of the network.
*   **Transit Traffic:**  The vulnerability can be triggered by transit traffic, regardless of whether SIP features are enabled on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the affected WLC or associated wireless network segments.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be carried out by an unauthenticated attacker; no prior access or login to the WLC or AP is required.
*   **Crafted SIP Packets:** The attacker needs to have the capability to generate and send the specially crafted SIP packets to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Cisco Wireless Access Points (APs) that are managed by Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs).
*   The vulnerability can be triggered even if SIP features are disabled on the device.
*   The affected AP will reload, causing a temporary loss of wireless service.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability, only software updates to fix it.
*   The vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCts87659.
*   CVSS score: Base 9.0, Temporal 7.4
