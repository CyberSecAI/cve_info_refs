Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-1959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect privilege checks within the Linux kernel's user namespace functionality, specifically when handling `/proc/<pid>/uid_map`. The kernel was checking the current effective user ID (`current_fsuid()`) of the process writing to the file instead of the effective user ID of the process that originally opened the file (`file->f_cred->fsuid`). This allowed an unprivileged process to open the `/proc/<pid>/uid_map` file and then pass this file descriptor to a privileged process, which would then be able to write to it, thereby setting user ID mappings without proper authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Privilege Check:** The primary vulnerability was the incorrect privilege check using the current fsuid instead of the opener's fsuid.
- **User Namespace Manipulation:** The vulnerability exploited the user namespace functionality, which is used to isolate user IDs.
- **File Descriptor Passing:** The exploit leverages the ability to pass file descriptors between processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Root Shell:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allowed an attacker to gain a root shell. The attacker would obtain a uid 0 shell without capabilities, which could then be easily escalated to full root privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to escalate privileges to root.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the local system.
- **File Descriptor Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to open the `/proc/<pid>/uid_map` file for a target process.
- **Inter-Process Communication:** The attacker needs to be able to pass the opened file descriptor to a privileged process, which can be achieved through standard inter-process communication mechanisms (e.g. sockets, pipes, etc.).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target Linux system as an unprivileged user.
- The attacker must be able to create a user namespace.
- The attacker needs to pass a file descriptor to a privileged process and trick it into using the file descriptor to write to the target process's `uid_map`.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affected Linux kernel versions 3.8 and various 3.9 release candidates.
- The provided exploit code (`userns_root_sploit.c`) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
- The exploit requires an additional program "zerozeroone" that writes the string "0 0 1" to stdout which will be redirected to the `/proc/<pid>/uid_map`.

**Fix:**

The vulnerability is fixed by three commits:

1.  `935d8aabd4331f47a89c3e1daa5779d23cf244ee`: Introduced `file_ns_capable()` to check capabilities at the time the file is opened.
2.  `6708075f104c3c9b04b23336bb0366ca30c3931b`: Prevents unprivileged users from tricking privileged users into setting the id\_map by checking the capabilities of the file opener.
3.  `e3211c120a85b792978bcb4be7b2886df18d27f0`: Ensures the kernel checks the fsuid of the file opener, not the current fsuid when writing to `uid_map`.

These patches ensure that both the opener and the writer of the `/proc/<pid>/uid_map` file have the necessary capabilities to set the id mappings.
