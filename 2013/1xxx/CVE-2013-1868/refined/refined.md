Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Buffer overflows in the freetype renderer and the HTML subtitle parser within VLC Media Player. These occur when parsing specially crafted files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which happens due to insufficient bounds checking during the parsing of a file. This occurs in two components: the freetype renderer and HTML subtitle parser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:**  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause VLC to crash due to invalid memory access.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** It could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system, if the buffer overflow can overwrite the return address.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Files:** The primary attack vector involves opening a specially crafted file designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
* **HTML Subtitles:** The subtitle vulnerability requires subtitles to be enabled.
* **VLC Browser Plugins:**  The advisory also mentions that the user must refrain from accessing untrusted remote sites or disable VLC browser plugins. This suggests that the vulnerability could potentially be triggered via browser plugins that process external media.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** Attackers need the capability to create files that are specially crafted to exploit the buffer overflow.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the victim to explicitly open the malicious file or access an untrusted remote site.
* **User configuration:** In the case of the subtitle vulnerability, subtitles need to be enabled for exploitation.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Aliz Hammond
*   Mitigation methods like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) can help reduce exposure but they are not foolproof and may be bypassed.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in VLC media player version 2.0.5. Patches are available for older versions from the official VLC source code repository 2.0.
