Response:
```
The provided content contains information about CVE-2013-1476.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The CORBA implementation did not properly restrict access to certain value handler constructors.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Missing access restriction on ValueHandlerImpl class constructors, allowing untrusted Java applications or applets to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can bypass Java sandbox restrictions by exploiting the lack of access control on value handler constructors, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

Attack vectors:
An untrusted Java application or applet can exploit the vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to be able to run an untrusted Java application or applet on a vulnerable system.
