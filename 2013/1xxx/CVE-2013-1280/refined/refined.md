Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-1280:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel improperly handling objects in memory, specifically a reference count issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of objects in memory leading to a reference count vulnerability in the Windows kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- This enables the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.
- Essentially, an attacker gains complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
- The attacker then needs to run a specially crafted application designed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs valid logon credentials.
- The attacker must have the ability to log on locally to the target system.
- The attacker requires the ability to execute a crafted application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" across all affected Windows versions.
- The provided documents confirm that Microsoft was not aware of public disclosure or exploitation of this vulnerability at the time the security bulletin was issued.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows kernel handles objects in memory, specifically how it manages reference counts.
