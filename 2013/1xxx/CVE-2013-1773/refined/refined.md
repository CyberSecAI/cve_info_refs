  "cveId": "CVE-2013-1773",
  "description": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way UTF-8 characters were converted to UTF-16 in the utf8s_to_utf16s() function of the Linux kernel's FAT file system implementation. A local user able to mount a FAT file system with the \"utf8=1\" option could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, to escalate their privileges.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The `utf8s_to_utf16s()` function in the Linux kernel's FAT file system implementation has a buffer overflow vulnerability when converting UTF-8 characters to UTF-16.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with the ability to mount a FAT file system using the utf8=1 option can trigger a system crash or potentially escalate privileges.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Mounting a FAT file system with utf8=1 option"
