Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-1808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `ZeroClipboard.swf` and `ZeroClipboard10.swf` files. These are Flash files used for copying text to the clipboard. The vulnerability lies in the way these Flash files handle the `id` parameter passed to them in the URL, and also in how they handle data being copied to the clipboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS via `id` parameter:** The Flash files do not properly sanitize the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through this parameter.
- **XSS via clipboard:** The Flash files do not sanitize the data being copied to the clipboard, allowing an attacker to copy malicious JavaScript code which then gets executed when pasted.
- **Widespread vulnerable component:** The `ZeroClipboard.swf` and `ZeroClipboard10.swf` were widely used in various web applications, plugins, and themes, making a large number of systems vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal cookies or other session information.
- **Website defacement:** The attacker can modify the content of the web page.
- **Malware distribution:** The attacker can redirect the victim to malicious websites or trigger downloads of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URLs:** Attackers can craft URLs to vulnerable `ZeroClipboard.swf` or `ZeroClipboard10.swf` files, injecting malicious JavaScript code through the `id` parameter.
- **Copy/Paste attacks:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the clipboard, which can be executed when pasted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Awareness of vulnerable software:** The attacker needs to be aware of websites using vulnerable versions of the `ZeroClipboard.swf` or `ZeroClipboard10.swf` files, or applications which bundle these components.
- **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- **Social engineering (for copy/paste attack):**  The attacker may need to trick a user into copying specially crafted content into the clipboard and pasting it into a vulnerable page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of ZeroClipboard up to 1.1.6. Version 1.1.7 and later are not affected, as the new developers addressed the issues.
- The vulnerability was found to be widespread, affecting many applications such as `em-shorty`, `RepRapCalculator`, `Fulcrum`, `Django`, `aCMS`, numerous WordPress plugins, and WordPress themes.
- The vulnerable files were widely distributed through the Google Code repository, and many sites linked directly to the vulnerable versions.
- The original author of ZeroClipboard was not responsive to the initial reports, requiring coordination with the new maintainers to mitigate the issue.
- The vulnerability is categorized as WASC-08 (Cross-Site Scripting)
- The vulnerable files are flash-based, so the attack requires a browser with flash support enabled.
