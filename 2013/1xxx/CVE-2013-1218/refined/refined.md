Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-1218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to improper handling of fragmented IP packets sent from the Cisco ASA data plane to the Cisco IPS processor for inspection and processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of fragmented IP packets. Specifically, a vulnerability in the implementation of the code that processes fragmented traffic. This lack of proper handling allows a remote attacker to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit can cause the *Analysis Engine* process to become unresponsive or cause the affected system to reload.
*   If the *Analysis Engine* becomes unresponsive, the system will drop traffic since it can't be processed, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   In High-Availability configurations, a system reload due to the vulnerability can trigger a failover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves sending a combination of fragmented and other IP packets through the affected system.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 fragmented packets passing through the affected system.
*   Traffic directed to the management IP address of the Cisco IPS software module will NOT trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic that transits through the affected Cisco IPS sensor.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
*   This vulnerability only affects Cisco ASA 5500-X Series IPS SSP *software modules*
*   Cisco IPS SSP *hardware modules* for the Cisco ASA 5585-X are not affected.
