Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details related to CVE-2013-1749:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page.

**Weaknesses:**
- Inadequate input validation and sanitization on the `Address` field within the `edit.php` page.

**Attack Vector:**
-  A malicious string is entered into the `Address` field of the contact form in `edit.php`.
- The injected script is triggered when a user hovers their mouse over the `First Name` field on the next page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session. This can lead to:
   -  Session hijacking
   -  Redirection to malicious sites
   -  Defacement of the web page
   -  Information theft (cookies, etc.)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `edit.php` form.
- The attacker can inject the malicious script into the `Address` field through the web interface.
