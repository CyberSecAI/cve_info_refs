Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1818:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `mwdoc-filter.php` file in MediaWiki's maintenance directory. This file is intended to be used by Doxygen via the command-line interface (CLI) SAPI. However, under certain server configurations, it can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read the content of any file accessible to the web server user by manipulating the `$argv` variable.

*   **Incorrect Handling of `$argv`:** The script mishandles the `$argv` variable, which can be influenced by user-supplied input under specific server configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained in arbitrary files on the server. This may include configuration files, database credentials, source code, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request, specifically manipulating the URL to control the `$argv` variable passed to the `mwdoc-filter.php` script. The method of manipulation depends on the server configuration
*   **Specific Server Configurations:** The exploitability depends on specific server configurations, specifically:
    *   The maintenance directory is accessible through the web server, which is typically prevented by a .htaccess file included in the maintenance directory
    *   `register_globals` is enabled in PHP (prior to PHP 5.4.0).
    *   `register_argc_argv` is enabled, which allows an attacker to overwrite $argv

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable MediaWiki instance.
*   **Knowledge of Server Configuration (potentially):** The attacker might need to be aware of the server configuration details in order to successfully trigger the vulnerability, such as whether  `register_globals` and `register_argc_argv` are enabled.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** MediaWiki 1.20.x is affected.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was addressed in MediaWiki 1.20.3. The fix involves sanitizing user input and preventing the use of the vulnerable `mwdoc-filter.php` script in non-CLI contexts.
*   **Conditions for Vulnerability:**
    *   If the `maintenance` directory is deleted or access to it is denied in the server configuration.
    *   If the server processes `.htaccess` overrides.
    *   If PHP 5.4.0 or later is being used, the `register_globals` configuration is disabled.
    *  If `register_argc_argv` is enabled.
*   **Low Likelihood, High Impact:** The vulnerability was considered to have a low likelihood of exploitation due to specific server config dependencies, but a high impact due to the potential to read arbitrary files.
