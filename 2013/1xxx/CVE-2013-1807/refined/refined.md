Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-1807:

**Root Cause:** Insecure handling of database backup files in `administration/db_backup.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Information Disclosure:** Database backup files are stored in a publicly accessible directory (`administration/db_backups/`) without any access restrictions.
2.  **Weak File Name Randomness:** The filenames generated for backups are not sufficiently random, making them potentially guessable via brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to database backup files, potentially revealing sensitive information such as user credentials, personal data, and other confidential details stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Direct File Access:** An attacker who knows or can guess the backup filename can access the file directly via a web request.
2.  **Filename Brute Forcing:** An attacker could try to guess the filename due to the weak randomness.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* No authentication is needed to access the backup files if the filename is known or guessed.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in how backup files are created and stored within `administration/db_backup.php`. Specifically, the code:

*   Moves uploaded backup files to `ADMIN."db_backups/".$file` directory.
*   Generates filenames using `rand(1000000, 9999999)` which provides insufficient randomness, making bruteforcing feasible.
*   Does not implement access restrictions on `administration/db_backups/` folder.

This vulnerability is distinct from the other vulnerabilities reported in the same advisory and is correctly assigned CVE-2013-1807.
