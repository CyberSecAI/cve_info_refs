Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2013-1323:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists due to Microsoft Publisher's improper handling of NULL values while parsing specially crafted Publisher files.

**Weakness:** Incorrect NULL Value Handling. The software fails to properly manage NULL values during file processing, leading to exploitable conditions.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Email:** An attacker could send a specially crafted Publisher file to a user, convincing them to open it.
    *   **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a website containing a malicious Publisher file. They could then attempt to convince users to visit the site, typically through a link in an email or instant message, and open the malicious file.
    *   Compromised websites: Malicious content could be hosted on compromised websites, potentially exploiting the vulnerability if users open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Publisher file that exploits the improper NULL value handling.
    *   The attacker must convince the user to open the malicious file, either through email or web-based attacks.
    *   No special user rights are required for the attack, as the attacker gains the privileges of the user who opens the file.

**Affected Software:**

*   Microsoft Publisher 2003 Service Pack 3

**Mitigations:**

*   Avoid opening Publisher files from untrusted or unexpected sources.
*   Users with fewer user rights are less impacted than those with administrative privileges.
*   The vulnerability can not be exploited automatically through email. A user needs to open the attachment.
