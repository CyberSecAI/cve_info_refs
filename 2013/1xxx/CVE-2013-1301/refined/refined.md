Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1301:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from Microsoft Visio's improper handling of XML external entities within specially crafted XML files. Specifically, the issue is related to how Visio's XML parser resolves external entities that are declared within other external entity declarations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of XML external entities by the Visio XML parser.
- The vulnerability allows reading of files from the target system due to incorrect processing of external entities in a specially crafted XML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read data from files on the target system.
- While it does not allow direct code execution or privilege escalation, the information obtained could be used to further compromise the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attack Scenario:** An attacker sends a specially crafted Visio file to a user, tricking them into opening it.
- **Web-Based Attack Scenario:** An attacker hosts a website with a malicious Visio file, and convinces the user to visit this website and open the file. Attackers could also use compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content to host the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Visio file containing malicious XML with external entities.
- The attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to the target user, either through email or by hosting it on a website.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the crafted file using a vulnerable version of Visio.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is categorized as an "Information Disclosure" vulnerability.
- The affected software includes Microsoft Visio 2003 SP3, Visio 2007 SP3, and Visio 2010 SP1 (both 32-bit and 64-bit editions).
- The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way Visio's XML parser resolves external entities.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index for this vulnerability is "2 - Exploitation Less Likely" (as of the bulletin's release in May 2013). This means that while an exploit is possible, it requires expertise and/or sophisticated techniques.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released, and Microsoft had not received reports of active exploitation when the bulletin was issued.
