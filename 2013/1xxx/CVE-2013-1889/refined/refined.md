Root cause of vulnerability:
The mod_ruid2 module before version 0.9.8 did not properly handle file descriptors when creating a chroot environment.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- File descriptor inheritance: A file descriptor used to break out of the chroot was inherited by all Apache subprocesses.
- Chroot bypass: A CGI script could use fchdir() on the inherited file descriptor to break out of the chroot.

Impact of exploitation:
Remote attackers could bypass the chroot security restrictions and potentially gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code on the server.

Attack vectors:
- Network-based attacks using HTTP requests to trigger a vulnerable CGI script.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the affected web server.
- Ability to execute a CGI script that uses fchdir().
