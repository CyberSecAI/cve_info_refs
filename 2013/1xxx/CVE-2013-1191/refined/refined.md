    "Weaknesses": [
      "Privilege Escalation",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote, authenticated attacker could obtain the privileges of an administrator in another VDC, potentially leading to complete control of the affected device.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote access via SSH to the management interfaces of an affected device.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be authenticated and have access to the management interfaces of an affected device via SSH."
