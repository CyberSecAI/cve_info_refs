  "CVE-2013-1475": {
    "description": "Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the AWT, CORBA, JMX, Libraries, and Beans components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the CORBA component of the Java Runtime Environment, specifically related to how IIOP types are reused. Insufficient checks or restrictions during type reuse within the CORBA implementation allow for a sandbox bypass.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper permission check in CORBA component"
       "Insecure reuse of IIOP types during deserialization"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could bypass the Java sandbox restrictions, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Java process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Untrusted Java applets delivered via web browsers",
        "Untrusted Java Web Start applications",
        "Supplying malicious data to APIs in the CORBA component (e.g. through a web service)"

    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would require the ability to deliver a malicious Java applet, a Java Web Start application, or to send crafted data to a vulnerable application or service using the CORBA interface.",
    "affected_versions": [
        "JDK and JRE 7 Update 11 and earlier",
        "JDK and JRE 6 Update 38 and earlier",
        "JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 38 and earlier",
        "SDK and JRE 1.4.2_40 and earlier"
    ]
