Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1800:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from multiple XML parsing issues within the `rubygem-crack` library. Specifically, the library was vulnerable to issues related to how it handled XML parsing when processing untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML Parsing Issues:** The `crack` library had flaws in its XML parsing logic which could be exploited.
- **YAML Parsing Vulnerability:**  The initial report mentions a Rails parameter parsing vulnerability, also impacting the `crack` library due to vulnerable code handling YAML parameters.
- **Typecasting Issues:**  The vulnerability is associated with type casting issues including symbol and YAML handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could inject malicious XML to cause denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XML Injection:** An attacker could inject specially crafted XML into an application using the vulnerable library.
- **Untrusted Data Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application uses the `crack` library to process untrusted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject XML:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious XML data into the application via parameters or other input mechanisms that utilize `rubygem-crack`.
- **Knowledge of Application Data Flow:** The attacker would need knowledge of how the application uses the vulnerable library to process XML or YAML.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in `rubygem-crack` version 0.1.7.
- The fix involved removing support for symbol and YAML typecasting.
- The `crack` library was found to have similar vulnerabilities to those discovered in Rails parameter parsing.
- This issue affected multiple other libraries and not just Rails.
- The vulnerability was also present when parsing YAML parameters.
- The fix was implemented by removing vulnerable code related to YAML parsing from the library.
- Specifically, the commit `e3da1212a1f84a898ee3601336d1dbbf118fb5f6` on the github repository for `jnunemaker/crack` addresses the vulnerability by removing the symbol and yaml typecasts.
- The vulnerability was also tracked as CVE-2013-0269.
