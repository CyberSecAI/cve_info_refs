Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `league_id` parameter in the `leaguemanager_export` page of the LeagueManager WordPress plugin. This parameter is directly used in an SQL query without any validation or escaping, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `league_id` POST parameter is not sanitized before being used in a database query.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The export functionality in `leaguemanager-export` is accessible via a POST request without requiring any authentication or established session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to access sensitive data, such as administrator usernames and password hashes. This can allow them to gain full control over the WordPress site.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker may be able to modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `wp-admin/admin.php?page=leaguemanager-export` URL, including a malicious `league_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to send HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `leaguemanager.php` and `admin/admin.php`.
*   The `export()` function in `admin/admin.php` is vulnerable because it passes the unsanitized `league_id` parameter to `$leaguemanager->getLeague()`, which directly uses it in an SQL query.
*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection to retrieve the `user_login` (username) and `user_pass` (password hash) from the `wp_users` table.
*   The injected data is returned in a CSV file format, which the exploit parses to extract the username and password hash.

**Additional Information**
*   The plugin's author no longer supports the plugin, and it has been discontinued. No patch is available.
