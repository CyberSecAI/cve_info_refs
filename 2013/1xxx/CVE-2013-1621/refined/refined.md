Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an array index error during the validation of CBC padding in a TLS session. Specifically, the code in PolarSSL does not properly sanity check the `padlen` value before performing the padding check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation for the padding length (`padlen`). The code does not verify if the padlen is within acceptable bounds.
- **Array Index Error:** Due to the lack of validation, an attacker can provide a crafted padding-length value, leading to out-of-bounds array access during comparison checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. By providing a crafted padding length, the attacker can cause out-of-bounds access leading to a crash, or other unexpected behavior, making the service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack is performed remotely, targeting the TLS session.
- **Crafted Packets:** The attacker sends malicious crafted TLS packets to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Manipulated Padding Length:** A crucial element of the attack involves manipulating the padding length within the crafted packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable service.
- **TLS Handshake/Session:** The attacker must be able to establish a TLS connection to send the malicious data.
- **Knowledge of TLS Protocol:** A basic understanding of TLS, especially CBC padding is required to craft the malicious packet

**Summary**
CVE-2013-1621 in PolarSSL arises from an array indexing error caused by insufficient validation of the padding length field of a TLS record. By sending a crafted TLS record, attackers can cause the server to perform an out-of-bounds memory access leading to a denial-of-service.
