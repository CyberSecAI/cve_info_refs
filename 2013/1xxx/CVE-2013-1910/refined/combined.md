### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
