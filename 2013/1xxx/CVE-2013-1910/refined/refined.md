  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Yum package manager did not properly remove and manage repository metadata in certain circumstances. Specifically, bad metadata was not removed properly and was reused in subsequent runs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of repository metadata",
      "Failure to remove invalid metadata"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject a specially crafted Trojan horse file into the metadata of a remote repository. This could potentially lead the Yum package manager to accept the invalid and untrusted metadata as valid, which may allow for arbitrary code execution and/or a denial-of-service condition.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Injection of malicious data into repository metadata",
        "Compromise of a remote repository"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to modify the metadata of a repository that the vulnerable yum instance is configured to use."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was fixed in yum version 3.4.3-31.fc17 for Fedora 17 and 3.4.3-51.fc18 for Fedora 18. The issue was found by James Antill of Red Hat and did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 because these versions did not use filelist metadata."
