Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-1835:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the "login as" functionality in Moodle. When an administrator uses this function to impersonate another user, they gain access to the impersonated user's personal repository content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control: The system fails to restrict access to personal repositories based on the "login as" impersonation.
- Information Leakage: Personal repository content of users is exposed to administrators when using "login as".

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Exposure of personal data: Administrators can view files and information stored in the external repositories of other users, potentially leading to a privacy breach and information leak.

**Attack vectors:**
-  "Login as" feature: An attacker would need administrative access to the Moodle platform and then utilize the "login as" functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Administrative access: The attacker needs to be an administrator or have the rights to use the "login as" functionality.
- Ability to use "login as" feature: The attacker must be capable of using the impersonation feature.

**Affected Versions:**
- 2.4 to 2.4.1
- 2.3 to 2.3.4
- 2.2 to 2.2.7
- Earlier unsupported versions (2.x only)

**Fixed Versions:**
- 2.4.2 and 2.4.3
- 2.3.5 and 2.3.6
