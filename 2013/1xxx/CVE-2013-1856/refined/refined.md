  "CVE-2013-1856": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "groups.google.com_2e325703_20250124_211645.html",
      "Version": "1.0"
    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Root_Cause": "The vulnerability lies in the JDOM backend of ActiveSupport's XML parser, specifically within the javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder class used by ActiveSupport::XmlMini_JDOM.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper XML parsing",
        "Default settings of javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder allowing external entity inclusion."
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can perform a denial-of-service attack or gain access to files stored on the application server by constructing malicious XML that, when parsed, includes content from arbitrary URLs, including local files.",
      "Attack_Vectors": "By providing a specially crafted XML document to be parsed by a vulnerable application.",
      "Attacker_Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit XML input to an affected Ruby on Rails application.",
        "Affected_Components": [
          "ActiveSupport XML parsing functionality",
          "JDOM backend",
           "javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder class"
        ],
        "Affected_Versions": [
         "Ruby on Rails 3.0.0 and all later versions when using JRuby and the JDOM backend"
        ],
      "Not_Affected": [
         "Applications not using JRuby",
         "JRuby applications not using the JDOM backend"
       ],
      "Mitigation": "Upgrade to Rails version 3.2.13 or 3.1.12, or use the workaround of setting ActiveSupport::XmlMini.backend to 'REXML'."
    }
