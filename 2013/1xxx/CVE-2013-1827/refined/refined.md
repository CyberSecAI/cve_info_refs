Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1827:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing NULL pointer check before dereferencing the `ccid` pointer in the `ccid_hc_rx_getsockopt` and `ccid_hc_tx_getsockopt` routines within the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation of the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the possibility of dereferencing a NULL `ccid` pointer. This occurs because the code does not validate the `ccid` pointer before attempting to access its members (`ccid->ccid_ops`). This is a classic example of a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash (DoS):** If exploited, this flaw can lead to a kernel crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).
- **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** The bug report mentions that a user capable of mapping page 0 could prepare a fake `ccid_ops` pointer in that memory region and possibly leverage this vulnerability for privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A local user or program can trigger the vulnerability by interacting with DCCP socket options.
- **Privileged User (CAP_NET_ADMIN):** While not explicitly stated in all sources, the bugzilla report mentions that a privileged user can trigger this flaw, this is further confirmed in the advisory RHSA-2013:0744

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- To trigger the DoS, a local user or a program needs to interact with the DCCP socket and its socket options.
- To achieve privilege escalation (as mentioned), an attacker may need the ability to map page 0 and craft a specific `ccid_ops` structure which in most cases requires root privileges

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernels built with Datagram Congestion Control Protocol(DCCP) support.
- The issue was fixed in Linux kernel version 3.6 and backported to stable/longterm kernels at the time.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was affected by this vulnerability. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 were not affected.
- Red Hat issued a security advisory (RHSA-2013:0744) to address this vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
- The fix involved adding a check to make sure that the `ccid` pointer is not NULL before dereferencing it.
- Upstream fix was made here: https://git.kernel.org/linus/276bdb82dedb290511467a5a4fdbe9f0b52dce6f
