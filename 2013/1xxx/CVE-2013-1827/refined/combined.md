## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0744)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Security:

* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was

found in the way the Intel i915 driver in the Linux kernel handled the
allocation of the buffer used for relocation copies. A local user with
console access could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate
their privileges. (CVE-2013-0913, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way UTF-8 characters were

converted to UTF-16 in the utf8s\_to\_utf16s() function of the Linux kernel's
FAT file system implementation. A local user able to mount a FAT file
system with the "utf8=1" option could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1773, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way KVM handled guest time updates when the

buffer the guest registered by writing to the MSR\_KVM\_SYSTEM\_TIME machine
state register (MSR) crossed a page boundary. A privileged guest user could
use this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges,
allowing them to execute arbitrary code at the host kernel level.
(CVE-2013-1796, Important)

* A potential use-after-free flaw was found in the way KVM handled guest

time updates when the GPA (guest physical address) the guest registered by
writing to the MSR\_KVM\_SYSTEM\_TIME machine state register (MSR) fell into a
movable or removable memory region of the hosting user-space process (by
default, QEMU-KVM) on the host. If that memory region is deregistered from
KVM using KVM\_SET\_USER\_MEMORY\_REGION and the allocated virtual memory
reused, a privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to
escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2013-1797, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way KVM emulated IOAPIC (I/O Advanced

Programmable Interrupt Controller). A missing validation check in the
ioapic\_read\_indirect() function could allow a privileged guest user to
crash the host, or read a substantial portion of host kernel memory.
(CVE-2013-1798, Important)

* A race condition in install\_user\_keyrings(), leading to a NULL pointer

dereference, was found in the key management facility. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2013-1792, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference in the XFRM implementation could allow a local

user who has the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2013-1826, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol

(DCCP) implementation could allow a local user to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2013-1827, Moderate)

* Information leak flaws in the XFRM implementation could allow a local

user who has the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to leak kernel stack memory to
user-space. (CVE-2012-6537, Low)

* Two information leak flaws in the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)

subsystem could allow a local, unprivileged user to leak kernel stack
memory to user-space. (CVE-2012-6546, Low)

* An information leak was found in the TUN/TAP device driver in the

networking implementation. A local user with access to a TUN/TAP virtual
interface could use this flaw to leak kernel stack memory to user-space.
(CVE-2012-6547, Low)

* An information leak in the Bluetooth implementation could allow a local

user who has the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to leak kernel stack memory to
user-space. (CVE-2013-0349, Low)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the tmpfs implementation. A local user

able to mount and unmount a tmpfs file system could use this flaw to cause
a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their privileges.
(CVE-2013-1767, Low)

* A NULL pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel's USB Inside Out

Edgeport Serial Driver implementation. An attacker with physical access to
a system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-1774,
Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Andrew Honig of Google for reporting
CVE-2013-1796, CVE-2013-1797, and CVE-2013-1798. CVE-2013-1792 was
discovered by Mateusz Guzik of Red Hat EMEA GSS SEG Team.

## Solution

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

dccp: check ccid before dereferencing

```
ccid_hc_rx_getsockopt() and ccid_hc_tx_getsockopt() might be called with
a NULL ccid pointer leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This could
lead to a privilege escalation if the attacker is able to map page 0 and
prepare it with a fake ccid_ops pointer.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

x86, microcode, AMD: Fix broken ucode patch size check
commit 36bf50d7697be18c6bfd0401e037df10bff1e573 upstream.
This issue was recently observed on an AMD C-50 CPU where a patch of
maximum size was applied.
Commit be62adb49294 ("x86, microcode, AMD: Simplify ucode verification")
added current\_size in get\_matching\_microcode(). This is calculated as
size of the ucode patch + 8 (ie. size of the header). Later this is
compared against the maximum possible ucode patch size for a CPU family.
And of course this fails if the patch has already maximum size.

uprobes: Fix mmap\_region()'s mm->mm\_rb corruption if uprobe\_mmap() fails
commit c7a3a88c938fbe3d70c2278e082b80eb830d1c58 upstream.
This patch fixes:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=843640
If mmap\_region()->uprobe\_mmap() fails, unmap\_and\_free\_vma path
does unmap\_region() but does not remove the soon-to-be-freed vma
from rb tree. Actually there are more problems but this is how
William noticed this bug.
Perhaps we could do do\_munmap() + return in this case, but in
fact it is simply wrong to abort if uprobe\_mmap() fails. Until
at least we move the !UPROBE\_COPY\_INSN code from
install\_breakpoint() to uprobe\_register().
For example, uprobe\_mmap()->install\_breakpoint() can fail if the
probed insn is not supported (remember, uprobe\_register()
succeeds if nobody mmaps inode/offset), mmap() should not fail
in this case.
dup\_mmap()->uprobe\_mmap() is wrong too by the same reason,
fork() can race with uprobe\_register() and fail for no reason if
it wins the race and does install\_breakpoint() first.
And, if nothing else, both mmap\_region() and dup\_mmap() return
success if uprobe\_mmap() fails. Change them to ignore the error
code from uprobe\_mmap().

xen/pciback: Fix proper FLR steps.

When we do FLR and save PCI config we did it in the wrong order.

xen/p2m: Fix one-off error in checking the P2M tree directory.
commit 50e900417b8096939d12a46848f965e27a905e36 upstream.
We would traverse the full P2M top directory (from 0->MAX\_DOMAIN\_PAGES
inclusive) when trying to figure out whether we can re-use some of the
P2M middle leafs.
Which meant that if the kernel was compiled with MAX\_DOMAIN\_PAGES=512
we would try to use the 512th entry. Fortunately for us the p2m\_top\_index
has a check for this:
BUG\_ON(pfn >= MAX\_P2M\_PFN);

xen: Use correct masking in xen\_swiotlb\_alloc\_coherent.
commit b5031ed1be0aa419250557123633453753181643 upstream.
When running 32-bit pvops-dom0 and a driver tries to allocate a coherent
DMA-memory the xen swiotlb-implementation returned memory beyond 4GB.
The underlaying reason is that if the supplied driver passes in a
DMA\_BIT\_MASK(64) ( hwdev->coherent\_dma\_mask is set to 0xffffffffffffffff)
our dma\_mask will be u64 set to 0xffffffffffffffff even if we set it to
DMA\_BIT\_MASK(32) previously. Meaning we do not reset the upper bits.
By using the dma\_alloc\_coherent\_mask function - it does the proper casting
and we get 0xfffffffff.
This caused not working sound on a system with 4 GB and a 64-bit
compatible sound-card with sets the DMA-mask to 64bit.
On bare-metal and the forward-ported xen-dom0 patches from OpenSuse a coherent
DMA-memory is always allocated inside the 32-bit address-range by calling
dma\_alloc\_coherent\_mask.
This patch adds the same functionality to xen swiotlb and is a rebase of the
original patch from Ronny Hegewald which never got upstream b/c the
underlaying reason was not understood until now.
The original email with the original patch is in:

PARISC: Redefine ATOMIC\_INIT and ATOMIC64\_INIT to drop the casts
commit bba3d8c3b3c0f2123be5bc687d1cddc13437c923 upstream.
The following build error occured during a parisc build with
swap-over-NFS patches applied.
net/core/sock.c:274:36: error: initializer element is not constant
net/core/sock.c:274:36: error: (near initialization for 'memalloc\_socks')
net/core/sock.c:274:36: error: initializer element is not constant
Dave Anglin says:
> Here is the line in sock.i:
>
> struct static\_key memalloc\_socks = ((struct static\_key) { .enabled =
> ((atomic\_t) { (0) }) });
The above line contains two compound literals. It also uses a designated
initializer to initialize the field enabled. A compound literal is not a
constant expression.
The location of the above statement isn't fully clear, but if a compound
literal occurs outside the body of a function, the initializer list must
consist of constant expressions.

e1000e: DoS while TSO enabled caused by link partner with small MSS
commit d821a4c4d11ad160925dab2bb009b8444beff484 upstream.
With a low enough MSS on the link partner and TSO enabled locally, the
networking stack can periodically send a very large (e.g. 64KB) TCP
message for which the driver will attempt to use more Tx descriptors than
are available by default in the Tx ring. This is due to a workaround in
the code that imposes a limit of only 4 MSS-sized segments per descriptor
which appears to be a carry-over from the older e1000 driver and may be
applicable only to some older PCI or PCIx parts which are not supported in
e1000e. When the driver gets a message that is too large to fit across the
configured number of Tx descriptors, it stops the upper stack from queueing
any more and gets stuck in this state. After a timeout, the upper stack
assumes the adapter is hung and calls the driver to reset it.
Remove the unnecessary limitation of using up to only 4 MSS-sized segments
per Tx descriptor, and put in a hard failure test to catch when attempting
to check for message sizes larger than would fit in the whole Tx ring.
Refactor the remaining logic that limits the size of data per Tx descriptor
from a seemingly arbitrary 8KB to a limit based on the dynamic size of the
Tx packet buffer as described in the hardware specification.
Also, fix the logic in the check for space in the Tx ring for the next
largest possible packet after the current one has been successfully queued
for transmit, and use the appropriate defines for default ring sizes in
e1000\_probe instead of magic values.
This issue goes back to the introduction of e1000e in 2.6.24 when it was
split off from e1000.

UBI: fix a horrible memory deallocation bug
commit 78b495c39add820ab66ab897af9bd77a5f2e91f6 upstream.
UBI was mistakingly using 'kfree()' instead of 'kmem\_cache\_free()' when
freeing "attach eraseblock" structures in vtbl.c. Thankfully, this happened
only when we were doing auto-format, so many systems were unaffected. However,
there are still many users affected.
It is strange, but the system did not crash and nothing bad happened when
the SLUB memory allocator was used. However, in case of SLOB we observed an
crash right away.
This problem was introduced in 2.6.39 by commit
"6c1e875 UBI: add slab cache for ubi\_scan\_leb objects"
A note for stable trees:
Because variable were renamed, this won't cleanly apply to older kernels.
Changing names like this should help:
1. ai -> si
2. aeb\_slab\_cache -> seb\_slab\_cache
3. new\_aeb -> new\_seb

i2c-designware: Fix build error if CONFIG\_I2C\_DESIGNWARE\_PLATFORM=y && CONFIG\_I2C\_DESIGNWARE\_PCI=y
commit e68bb91baa0bb9817567bd45d560919e8e26373b upstream.
This patch adds config I2C\_DESIGNWARE\_CORE in Kconfig, and let
I2C\_DESIGNWARE\_PLATFORM and I2C\_DESIGNWARE\_PCI select I2C\_DESIGNWARE\_CORE.
Because both I2C\_DESIGNWARE\_PLATFORM and I2C\_DESIGNWARE\_PCI can be built as
built-in or module, we also need to export the functions in i2c-designware-core.
This fixes below build error when CONFIG\_I2C\_DESIGNWARE\_PLATFORM=y &&

ext3: Fix fdatasync() for files with only i\_size changes
commit 156bddd8e505b295540f3ca0e27dda68cb0d49aa upstream.
Code tracking when transaction needs to be committed on fdatasync(2) forgets
to handle a situation when only inode's i\_size is changed. Thus in such
situations fdatasync(2) doesn't force transaction with new i\_size to disk
and that can result in wrong i\_size after a crash.
Fix the issue by updating inode's i\_datasync\_tid whenever its size is
updated.

commit 9c2fc0de1a6e638fe58c354a463f544f42a90a09 upstream.
When a file is stored in ICB (inode), we overwrite part of the file, and
the page containing file's data is not in page cache, we end up corrupting
file's data by overwriting them with zeros. The problem is we use
simple\_write\_begin() which simply zeroes parts of the page which are not
written to. The problem has been introduced by be021ee4 (udf: convert to
new aops).
Fix the problem by providing a ->write\_begin function which makes the page
properly uptodate.

SCSI: Fix 'Device not ready' issue on mpt2sas
commit 14216561e164671ce147458653b1fea06a4ada1e upstream.
This is a particularly nasty SCSI ATA Translation Layer (SATL) problem.
SAT-2 says (section 8.12.2)
if the device is in the stopped state as the result of
processing a START STOP UNIT command (see 9.11), then the SATL
shall terminate the TEST UNIT READY command with CHECK CONDITION
status with the sense key set to NOT READY and the additional
sense code of LOGICAL UNIT NOT READY, INITIALIZING COMMAND
REQUIRED;
mpt2sas internal SATL seems to implement this. The result is very confusing
standby behaviour (using hdparm -y). If you suspend a drive and then send
another command, usually it wakes up. However, if the next command is a TEST
UNIT READY, the SATL sees that the drive is suspended and proceeds to follow
the SATL rules for this, returning NOT READY to all subsequent commands. This
means that the ordering of TEST UNIT READY is crucial: if you send TUR and
then a command, you get a NOT READY to both back. If you send a command and
then a TUR, you get GOOD status because the preceeding command woke the drive.
This bit us badly because

block: flush MEDIA\_CHANGE from drivers on close(2)
Changed our ordering on TEST UNIT READY commands meaning that SATA drives
connected to an mpt2sas now suspend and refuse to wake (because the mpt2sas
SATL sees the suspend \*before\* the drives get awoken by the next ATA command)
resulting in lots of failed commands.
The standard is completely nuts forcing this inconsistent behaviour, but we
have to work around it.
The fix for this is twofold:
1. Set the allow\_restart flag so we wake the drive when we see it has been
suspended
2. Return all TEST UNIT READY status directly to the mid layer without any
further error handling which prevents us causing error handling which
may offline the device just because of a media check TUR.

SCSI: mpt2sas: Fix for Driver oops, when loading driver with max\_queue\_depth command line option to a very small value
commit 338b131a3269881c7431234855c93c219b0979b6 upstream.
If the specified max\_queue\_depth setting is less than the
expected number of internal commands, then driver will calculate
the queue depth size to a negitive number. This negitive number
is actually a very large number because variable is unsigned
16bit integer. So, the driver will ask for a very large amount of
memory for message frames and resulting into oops as memory
allocation routines will not able to handle such a large request.
So, in order to limit this kind of oops, The driver need to set
the max\_queue\_depth to a scsi mid layer's can\_queue value. Then
the overall message frames required for IO is minimum of either
(max\_queue\_depth plus internal commands) or the IOC global
credits.

Fix order of arguments to compat\_put\_time[spec|val]

Commit 644595f89620 ("compat: Handle COMPAT\_USE\_64BIT\_TIME in
net/socket.c") introduced a bug where the helper functions to take
either a 64-bit or compat time[spec|val] got the arguments in the wrong
order, passing the kernel stack pointer off as a user pointer (and vice
versa).
Because of the user address range check, that in turn then causes an
EFAULT due to the user pointer range checking failing for the kernel
address. Incorrectly resuling in a failed system call for 32-bit
processes with a 64-bit kernel.
On odder architectures like HP-PA (with separate user/kernel address
spaces), it can be used read kernel memory.

powerpc: Make sure IPI handlers see data written by IPI senders
commit 9fb1b36ca1234e64a5d1cc573175303395e3354d upstream.
We have been observing hangs, both of KVM guest vcpu tasks and more
generally, where a process that is woken doesn't properly wake up and
continue to run, but instead sticks in TASK\_WAKING state. This
happens because the update of rq->wake\_list in ttwu\_queue\_remote()
is not ordered with the update of ipi\_message in
smp\_muxed\_ipi\_message\_pass(), and the reading of rq->wake\_list in
scheduler\_ipi() is not ordered with the reading of ipi\_message in
smp\_ipi\_demux(). Thus it is possible for the IPI receiver not to see
the updated rq->wake\_list and therefore conclude that there is nothing
for it to do.
In order to make sure that anything done before smp\_send\_reschedule()
is ordered before anything done in the resulting call to scheduler\_ipi(),
this adds barriers in smp\_muxed\_message\_pass() and smp\_ipi\_demux().
The barrier in smp\_muxed\_message\_pass() is a full barrier to ensure that
there is a full ordering between the smp\_send\_reschedule() caller and
scheduler\_ipi(). In smp\_ipi\_demux(), we use xchg() rather than
xchg\_local() because xchg() includes release and acquire barriers.
Using xchg() rather than xchg\_local() makes sense given that
ipi\_message is not just accessed locally.
This moves the barrier between setting the message and calling the
cause\_ipi() function into the individual cause\_ipi implementations.
Most of them -- those that used outb, out\_8 or similar -- already had
a full barrier because out\_8 etc. include a sync before the MMIO
store. This adds an explicit barrier in the two remaining cases.
These changes made no measurable difference to the speed of IPIs as
measured using a simple ping-pong latency test across two CPUs on
different cores of a POWER7 machine.
The analysis of the reason why processes were not waking up properly
is due to Milton Miller.

During a context switch we always restore the per thread DSCR value.
If we aren't doing explicit DSCR management

Check thread.dscr\_inherit and select the default DSCR or per thread

more threads than CPUs (ie forcing context switching):

We will eventually update it at context switch time but there is

If we fork at this point we will copy the old value of thread.dscr

two endpoint in different interfaces simultaniously.
Take care for this by catching the case where data and sync endpoints
are located on different interfaces and calling snd\_usb\_set\_interface()
between the start of the two endpoints.

ALSA: snd-usb: fix calls to next\_packet\_size
commit 245baf983cc39524cce39c24d01b276e6e653c9e upstream.
In order to support devices with implicit feedback streaming models,
packet sizes are now stored with each individual urb, and the PCM
handling code which fills the buffers purely relies on the size fields
now.
However, calling snd\_usb\_audio\_next\_packet\_size() for all possible
packets in an URB at once, prior to letting the PCM code do its job
does in fact not lead to the same behaviour than what the old code did:
The PCM code will break its loop once a period boundary is reached,
consequently using up less packets that it really could.
As snd\_usb\_audio\_next\_packet\_size() implements a feedback mechanism to
the endpoints phase accumulator, the number of calls to that function
matters, and when called too often, the data rate runs out of bounds.
Fix this by making the next\_packet function public, and call it from the
PCM code as before if the packet data sizes are not defined.

ALSA: snd-usb: Fix URB cancellation at stream start
commit 015618b902ae8e28705b7af9b4668615fea48ddd upstream.
Commit e9ba389c5 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Fix scheduling-while-atomic bug in
PCM capture stream") fixed a scheduling-while-atomic bug that happened
when snd\_usb\_endpoint\_start was called from the trigger callback, which
is an atmic context. However, the patch breaks the idea of the endpoints
reference counting, which is the reason why the driver has been
refactored lately.
Revert that commit and let snd\_usb\_endpoint\_start() take care of the URB
cancellation again. As this function is called from both atomic and
non-atomic context, add a flag to denote whether the function may sleep.

If a device specifies zero endpoints in its interface descriptor,

x32: Use compat shims for {g,s}etsockopt
commit 515c7af85ed92696c311c53d53cb4898ff32d784 upstream.
Some of the arguments to {g,s}etsockopt are passed in userland pointers.
If we try to use the 64bit entry point, we end up sometimes failing.
For example, dhcpcd doesn't run in x32:
# dhcpcd eth0
dhcpcd[1979]: version 5.5.6 starting
dhcpcd[1979]: eth0: broadcasting for a lease
dhcpcd[1979]: eth0: open\_socket: Invalid argument
dhcpcd[1979]: eth0: send\_raw\_packet: Bad file descriptor
The code in particular is getting back EINVAL when doing:
struct sock\_fprog pf;
setsockopt(s, SOL\_SOCKET, SO\_ATTACH\_FILTER, &pf, sizeof(pf));
Diving into the kernel code, we can see:
include/linux/filter.h:
struct sock\_fprog {
unsigned short len;
struct sock\_filter \_\_user \*filter;
};
net/core/sock.c:
case SO\_ATTACH\_FILTER:
ret = -EINVAL;
if (optlen == sizeof(struct sock\_fprog)) {
struct sock\_fprog fprog;
ret = -EFAULT;
if (copy\_from\_user(&fprog, optval, sizeof(fprog)))
break;
ret = sk\_attach\_filter(&fprog, sk);
}
break;
arch/x86/syscalls/syscall\_64.tbl:
54 common setsockopt sys\_setsockopt
55 common getsockopt sys\_getsockopt
So for x64, sizeof(sock\_fprog) is 16 bytes. For x86/x32, it's 8 bytes.
This comes down to the pointer being 32bit for x32, which means we need
to do structure size translation. But since x32 comes in directly to
sys\_setsockopt, it doesn't get translated like x86.
After changing the syscall table and rebuilding glibc with the new kernel
headers, dhcp runs fine in an x32 userland.
Oddly, it seems like Linus noted the same thing during the initial port,
but I guess that was missed/lost along the way:

uvcvideo: Reset the bytesused field when recycling an erroneous buffer
commit 8a3f0ede2b3f5477122060af1a816c6bbf09fcd2 upstream.
Buffers marked as erroneous are recycled immediately by the driver if
the nodrop module parameter isn't set. The buffer payload size is reset
to 0, but the buffer bytesused field isn't. This results in the buffer
being immediately considered as complete, leading to an infinite loop in
interrupt context.
Fix the problem by resetting the bytesused field when recycling the
buffer.

commit bea6832cc8c4a0a9a65dd17da6aaa657fe27bc3e upstream.
On architectures where cputime\_t is 64 bit type, is possible to trigger
divide by zero on do\_div(temp, (\_\_force u32) total) line, if total is a
non zero number but has lower 32 bit's zeroed. Removing casting is not
a good solution since some do\_div() implementations do cast to u32
internally.

A PCM capture stream on usb-audio causes a scheduling-while-atomic
BUG, as reported in the bugzilla entry below. It's because
snd\_usb\_endpoint\_start() is called at first at trigger START for a
capture stream, and this function contains the left-over EP
deactivation codes. The problem doesn't happen for a playback stream
because the function is called at PCM prepare time, which can sleep.
This patch fixes the BUG by moving the EP deactivation code into the
PCM prepare callback.

block: replace \_\_getblk\_slow misfix by grow\_dev\_page fix
commit 676ce6d5ca3098339c028d44fe0427d1566a4d2d upstream.
Commit 91f68c89d8f3 ("block: fix infinite loop in \_\_getblk\_slow")
is not good: a successful call to grow\_buffers() cannot guarantee
that the page won't be reclaimed before the immediate next call to
\_\_find\_get\_block(), which is why there was always a loop there.
Yesterday I got "EXT4-fs error (device loop0): \_\_ext4\_get\_inode\_loc:3595:
inode #19278: block 664: comm cc1: unable to read itable block" on console,
which pointed to this commit.
I've been trying to bisect for weeks, why kbuild-on-ext4-on-loop-on-tmpfs
sometimes fails from a missing header file, under memory pressure on
ppc G5. I've never seen this on x86, and I've never seen it on 3.5-rc7
itself, despite that commit being in there: bisection pointed to an
irrelevant pinctrl merge, but hard to tell when failure takes between
18 minutes and 38 hours (but so far it's happened quicker on 3.6-rc2).
(I've since found such \_\_ext4\_get\_inode\_loc errors in /var/log/messages
from previous weeks: why the message never appeared on console until
yesterday morning is a mystery for another day.)
Revert 91f68c89d8f3, restoring \_\_getblk\_slow() to how it was (plus
a checkpatch nitfix). Simplify the interface between grow\_buffers()
and grow\_dev\_page(), and avoid the infinite loop beyond end of device
by instead checking init\_page\_buffers()'s end\_block there (I presume
that's more efficient than a repeated call to blkdev\_max\_block()),
returning -ENXIO to \_\_getblk\_slow() in that case.
And remove akpm's ten-year-old "\_\_getblk() cannot fail ... weird"
comment, but that is worrying: are all users of \_\_getblk() really
now prepared for a NULL bh beyond end of device, or will some oops??

PCI: EHCI: Fix crash during hibernation on ASUS computers
commit 0b68c8e2c3afaf9807eb1ebe0ccfb3b809570aa4 upstream.
Commit dbf0e4c (PCI: EHCI: fix crash during suspend on ASUS
computers) added a workaround for an ASUS suspend issue related to
USB EHCI and a bug in a number of ASUS BIOSes that attempt to shut
down the EHCI controller during system suspend if its PCI command
register doesn't contain 0 at that time.
It turns out that the same workaround is necessary in the analogous
hibernation code path, so add it.

ath9k: fix decrypt\_error initialization in ath\_rx\_tasklet()
commit e1352fde5682ab1bdd2a9e5d75c22d1fe210ef77 upstream.
ath\_rx\_tasklet() calls ath9k\_rx\_skb\_preprocess() and ath9k\_rx\_skb\_postprocess()
in a loop over the received frames. The decrypt\_error flag is
initialized to false
just outside ath\_rx\_tasklet() loop. ath9k\_rx\_accept(), called by
ath9k\_rx\_skb\_preprocess(),
only sets decrypt\_error to true and never to false.
Then ath\_rx\_tasklet() calls ath9k\_rx\_skb\_postprocess() and passes
decrypt\_error to it.
So, after a decryption error, in ath9k\_rx\_skb\_postprocess(), we can
have a leftover value
from another processed frame. In that case, the frame will not be marked with
RX\_FLAG\_DECRYPTED even if it is decrypted correctly.
When using CCMP encryption this issue can lead to connection stuck
because of CCMP
PN corruption and a waste of CPU time since mac80211 tries to decrypt an already
deciphered frame with ieee80211\_aes\_ccm\_decrypt.
Fix the issue initializing decrypt\_error flag at the begging of the
ath\_rx\_tasklet() loop.

svcrpc: sends on closed socket should stop immediately
commit f06f00a24d76e168ecb38d352126fd203937b601 upstream.
svc\_tcp\_sendto sets XPT\_CLOSE if we fail to transmit the entire reply.
However, the XPT\_CLOSE won't be acted on immediately. Meanwhile other
threads could send further replies before the socket is really shut
down. This can manifest as data corruption: for example, if a truncated
read reply is followed by another rpc reply, that second reply will look
to the client like further read data.
Symptoms were data corruption preceded by svc\_tcp\_sendto logging
something like

svcrpc: fix svc\_xprt\_enqueue/svc\_recv busy-looping
commit d10f27a750312ed5638c876e4bd6aa83664cccd8 upstream.
The rpc server tries to ensure that there will be room to send a reply
before it receives a request.
It does this by tracking, in xpt\_reserved, an upper bound on the total
size of the replies that is has already committed to for the socket.
Currently it is adding in the estimate for a new reply \*before\* it
checks whether there is space available. If it finds that there is not
space, it then subtracts the estimate back out.
This may lead the subsequent svc\_xprt\_enqueue to decide that there is
space after all.
The results is a svc\_recv() that will repeatedly return -EAGAIN, causing
server threads to loop without doing any actual work.

svcrpc: fix BUG() in svc\_tcp\_clear\_pages
commit be1e44441a560c43c136a562d49a1c9623c91197 upstream.
Examination of svc\_tcp\_clear\_pages shows that it assumes sk\_tcplen is
consistent with sk\_pages[] (in particular, sk\_pages[n] can't be NULL if
sk\_tcplen would lead us to expect n pages of data).
svc\_tcp\_restore\_pages zeroes out sk\_pages[] while leaving sk\_tcplen.
This is OK, since both functions are serialized by XPT\_BUSY. However,
that means the inconsistency must be repaired before dropping XPT\_BUSY.
Therefore we should be ensuring that svc\_tcp\_save\_pages repairs the
problem before exiting svc\_tcp\_recv\_record on error.
Symptoms were a BUG() in svc\_tcp\_clear\_pages.

Commit 442a4f6308e694e0fa6025708bd5e4e424bbf51c added btrfs device
statistic counters for detected IO and checksum errors to Linux 3.5.
The statistic part that counts checksum errors in
end\_bio\_extent\_readpage() can cause a BUG() in a subfunction:
"kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/volumes.c:3762!"
That part is reverted with the current patch.
However, the counting of checksum errors in the scrub context remains
active, and the counting of detected IO errors (read, write or flush

drm: stop vmgfx driver explosion
commit f5869a8308f77e3dfdc2e3640842b285aa788ff8 upstream.
If you do a page flip with no flags set then event is NULL. If event is
NULL then the vmw\_gfx driver likes to go digging into NULL and extracts
NULL->base.file\_priv.
On a modern kernel with NULL mapping protection it's just another oops,
without it there are some "intriguing" possibilities.
What it should do is an open question but that for the driver owners to

audit: fix refcounting in audit-tree
commit a2140fc0cb0325bb6384e788edd27b9a568714e2 upstream.
Refcounting of fsnotify\_mark in audit tree is broken. E.g:
refcount
create\_chunk
alloc\_chunk 1
fsnotify\_add\_mark 2
untag\_chunk
fsnotify\_get\_mark 3
fsnotify\_destroy\_mark
audit\_tree\_freeing\_mark 2
fsnotify\_put\_mark 1
fsnotify\_put\_mark 0
via destroy\_list
fsnotify\_mark\_destroy -1
This was reported by various people as triggering Oops when stopping auditd.
We could just remove the put\_mark from audit\_tree\_freeing\_mark() but that would
break freeing via inode destruction. So this patch simply omits a put\_mark
after calling destroy\_mark or adds a get\_mark before.
The additional get\_mark is necessary where there's no other put\_mark after
fsnotify\_destroy\_mark() since it assumes that the caller is holding a reference
(or the inode is keeping the mark pinned, not the case here AFAICS).

Bluetooth: Fix legacy pairing with some devices
commit a9ea3ed9b71cc3271dd59e76f65748adcaa76422 upstream.
Some devices e.g. some Android based phones don't do SDP search before
pairing and cancel legacy pairing when ACL is disconnected.
PIN Code Request event which changes ACL timeout to HCI\_PAIRING\_TIMEOUT
is only received after remote user entered PIN.
In that case no L2CAP is connected so default HCI\_DISCONN\_TIMEOUT
(2 seconds) is being used to timeout ACL connection. This results in
problems with legacy pairing as remote user has only few seconds to
enter PIN before ACL is disconnected.
Increase disconnect timeout for incomming connection to
HCI\_PAIRING\_TIMEOUT if SSP is disabled and no linkey exists.
To avoid keeping ACL alive for too long after SDP search set ACL
timeout back to HCI\_DISCONN\_TIMEOUT when L2CAP is connected.

UBIFS: fix complaints about too small debug buffer size
commit 65b455b123c7e2b835a0b7148f9bae584f95000e upstream.
When debugging is enabled, we use a temporary on-stack buffer for formatting
the key strings like "(11368871, direntry, 0xcd0750)". The buffer size is
32 bytes and sometimes it is not enough to fit the key string - e.g., when
inode numbers are high. This is not fatal, but the key strings are incomplete
and UBIFS complains like this:
UBIFS assert failed in dbg\_snprintf\_key at 137 (pid 1)
This is a regression caused by "515315a UBIFS: fix key printing".
Fix the issue by increasing the buffer to 48 bytes.

Commit d5497fc693a446ce9100fcf4117c3f795ddfd0d2 "nfsd4: move rq\_flavor

places (cl\_flavor and cl\_cred.cr\_flavor) for the flavor to be stored.
After that patch, the latter was the one that was updated, but the
former was the one that the callback used.
Symptoms were a long delay on utime(). This is because the utime()
generated a setattr which recalled a delegation, but the cb\_recall was
ignored by the client because it had the wrong security flavor.

NFS: Clear key construction data if the idmap upcall fails
commit c5066945b7ea346a11424dbeb7830b7d7d00c206 upstream.
idmap\_pipe\_downcall already clears this field if the upcall succeeds,
but if it fails (rpc.idmapd isn't running) the field will still be set
on the next call triggering a BUG\_ON(). This patch tries to handle all
possible ways that the upcall could fail and clear the idmap key data
for each one.

NFSv4.1: Remove a bogus BUG\_ON() in nfs4\_layoutreturn\_done
commit 47fbf7976e0b7d9dcdd799e2a1baba19064d9631 upstream.
Ever since commit 0a57cdac3f (NFSv4.1 send layoutreturn to fence
disconnected data server) we've been sending layoutreturn calls
while there is potentially still outstanding I/O to the data
servers. The reason we do this is to avoid races between replayed
writes to the MDS and the original writes to the DS.
When this happens, the BUG\_ON() in nfs4\_layoutreturn\_done can
be triggered because it assumes that we would never call
layoutreturn without knowing that all I/O to the DS is
finished. The fix is to remove the BUG\_ON() now that the
assumptions behind the test are obsolete.

pnfs: defer release of pages in layoutget
commit 8554116e17eef055d9dd58a94b3427cb2ad1c317 upstream.
we have encountered a bug whereby reading a lot of files (copying
fedora's /bin) from a pNFS mount and hitting Ctrl+C in the middle caused
a general protection fault in xdr\_shrink\_bufhead. this function is
called when decoding the response from LAYOUTGET. the decoding is done
by a worker thread, and the caller of LAYOUTGET waits for the worker
thread to complete.
hitting Ctrl+C caused the synchronous wait to end and the next thing the
caller does is to free the pages, so when the worker thread calls
xdr\_shrink\_bufhead, the pages are gone. therefore, the cleanup of these
pages has been moved to nfs4\_layoutget\_release.

mm: hugetlbfs: correctly populate shared pmd
commit eb48c071464757414538c68a6033c8f8c15196f8 upstream.
Each page mapped in a process's address space must be correctly
accounted for in \_mapcount. Normally the rules for this are
straightforward but hugetlbfs page table sharing is different. The page
table pages at the PMD level are reference counted while the mapcount
remains the same.
If this accounting is wrong, it causes bugs like this one reported by
Larry Woodman:

During fork(), copy\_hugetlb\_page\_range() detects if huge\_pte\_alloc()
shared page tables with the check dst\_pte == src\_pte. The logic is if
the PMD page is the same, they must be shared. This assumes that the
sharing is between the parent and child. However, if the sharing is
with a different process entirely then this check fails as in this
diagram:
parent
|
------------>pmd
src\_pte----------> data page
^
other--------->pmd--------------------|
^
child-----------|
dst\_pte
For this situation to occur, it must be possible for Parent and Other to
have faulted and failed to share page tables with each other. This is
possible due to the following style of race.
PROC A PROC B
copy\_hugetlb\_page\_range copy\_hugetlb\_page\_range
src\_pte == huge\_pte\_offset src\_pte == huge\_pte\_offset
!src\_pte so no sharing !src\_pte so no sharing
(time passes)
hugetlb\_fault hugetlb\_fault
huge\_pte\_alloc huge\_pte\_alloc
huge\_pmd\_share huge\_pmd\_share
LOCK(i\_mmap\_mutex)
find nothing, no sharing
UNLOCK(i\_mmap\_mutex)
LOCK(i\_mmap\_mutex)
find nothing, no sharing
UNLOCK(i\_mmap\_mutex)
pmd\_alloc pmd\_alloc
LOCK(instantiation\_mutex)
fault
UNLOCK(instantiation\_mutex)
LOCK(instantiation\_mutex)
fault
UNLOCK(instantiation\_mutex)
These two processes are not poing to the same data page but are not
sharing page tables because the opportunity was missed. When either
process later forks, the src\_pte == dst pte is potentially insufficient.
As the check falls through, the wrong PTE information is copied in
(harmless but wrong) and the mapcount is bumped for a page mapped by a
shared page table leading to the BUG\_ON.
This patch addresses the issue by moving pmd\_alloc into huge\_pmd\_share
which guarantees that the shared pud is populated in the same critical
section as pmd. This also means that huge\_pte\_offset test in
huge\_pmd\_share is serialized correctly now which in turn means that the
success of the sharing will be higher as the racing tasks see the pud
and pmd populated together.
Race identified and changelog written mostly by Mel Gorman.

Currently we export SOCK\_NONBLOCK to user space but that conflicts with

(e.g. see Debian bug #658460).
The generic socket.h restricts the definition of SOCK\_NONBLOCK to the

ARM: imx: build i.MX6 functions only when needed
commit 1fc593feaf8e440511f381f4cdff483b55bbf546 upstream.
The head-v7.S contains a call to the generic cpu\_suspend function,
which is only available when selected by the i.MX6 code. As
pointed out by Shawn Guo, i.MX5 does not actually use any
functions defined in head-v7.S. It is also needed only for
the i.MX6 power management code and for the SMP code, so
we can restrict building this file to situations in which
at least one of those two is present.
Finally, other platforms with a similar file call it headsmp.S,
so we can rename it to the same for consistency.
Without this patch, building imx5 standalone results in:

ARM: imx6: spin the cpu until hardware takes it down
commit c944b0b9354ea06ffb0c8a7178949f1185f9f499 upstream.
Though commit 602bf40 (ARM: imx6: exit coherency when shutting down
a cpu) improves the stability of imx6q cpu hotplug a lot, there are
still hangs seen with a more stressful hotplug testing.
It's expected that once imx\_enable\_cpu(cpu, false) is called, the cpu
will be taken down by hardware immediately, and the code after that
will not get any chance to execute. However, this is not always the
case from the testing. The cpu could possibly be alive for a few
cycles before hardware actually takes it down. So rather than letting
cpu execute some code that could cause a hang in these cycles, let's
make the cpu spin there and wait for hardware to take it down.

xen/setup: Fix one-off error when adding for-balloon PFNs to the P2M.
commit c96aae1f7f393387d160211f60398d58463a7e65 upstream.
When we are finished with return PFNs to the hypervisor, then
populate it back, and also mark the E820 MMIO and E820 gaps
as IDENTITY\_FRAMEs, we then call P2M to set areas that can
be used for ballooning. We were off by one, and ended up
over-writting a P2M entry that most likely was an IDENTITY\_FRAME.
For example:
1-1 mapping on 40000->40200
1-1 mapping on bc558->bc5ac
1-1 mapping on bc5b4->bc8c5
1-1 mapping on bc8c6->bcb7c
1-1 mapping on bcd00->100000
Released 614 pages of unused memory
Set 277889 page(s) to 1-1 mapping
Populating 40200-40466 pfn range: 614 pages added
=> here we set from 40466 up to bc559 P2M tree to be
INVALID\_P2M\_ENTRY. We should have done it up to bc558.
The end result is that if anybody is trying to construct
a PTE for PFN bc558 they end up with ~PAGE\_PRESENT.

If P2M leaf is completly packed with INVALID\_P2M\_ENTRY or with

with either a p2m\_missing or p2m\_identity respectively. The old
page (which was created via extend\_brk or was grafted on from the
mfn\_list) can be re-used for setting new PFNs.

ARM: S3C24XX: Fix s3c2410\_dma\_enqueue parameters
commit b01858c7806e7e6f6121da2e51c9222fc4d21dc6 upstream.
Commit d670ac019f60 (ARM: SAMSUNG: DMA Cleanup as per sparse) changed the
prototype of the s3c2410\_dma\_\* functions to use the enum dma\_ch instead
of an generic unsigned int.
In the s3c24xx dma.c s3c2410\_dma\_enqueue seems to have been forgotten,
the other functions there were changed correctly.

ARM: S3C24XX: Add missing DMACH\_DT\_PROP
commit e1267371eacf2cbcf580e41f9e64a986cdaf5c1d upstream.
Commit 2b90807549 (spi: s3c64xx: add device tree support) requires
the DMACH\_DT\_PROP element in the dma\_ch enum. It's not used on non-DT
platforms but has to be present nevertheless.
So mimic the dummy-add of DMACH\_DT\_PROP on s3c64xx for s3c24xx
machines, to correct the build breakage for the s3c24xx variants
using the s3c64xx-spi-driver.

ARM: OMAP2+: Fix dmtimer set source clock failure
commit 54f32a35f4d3a653a18a2c8c239f19ae060bd803 upstream.
Calling the dmtimer function omap\_dm\_timer\_set\_source() fails if following a
call to pm\_runtime\_put() to disable the timer. For example the following
sequence would fail to set the parent clock ...
omap\_dm\_timer\_stop(gptimer);
omap\_dm\_timer\_set\_source(gptimer, OMAP\_TIMER\_SRC\_32\_KHZ);
The following error message would be seen ...
omap\_dm\_timer\_set\_source: failed to set timer\_32k\_ck as parent
The problem is that, by design, pm\_runtime\_put() simply decrements the usage
count and returns before the timer has actually been disabled. Therefore,
setting the parent clock failed because the timer was still active when the
trying to set the parent clock. Setting a parent clock will fail if the clock
you are setting the parent of has a non-zero usage count. To ensure that this
does not fail use pm\_runtime\_put\_sync() when disabling the timer.
Note that this will not be seen on OMAP1 devices, because these devices do
not use the clock framework for dmtimers.

ARM: 7489/1: errata: fix workaround for erratum #720789 on UP systems
commit 730a8128cd8978467eb1cf546b11014acb57d433 upstream.
Commit 5a783cbc4836 ("ARM: 7478/1: errata: extend workaround for erratum
#720789") added workarounds for erratum #720789 to the range TLB
invalidation functions with the observation that the erratum only
affects SMP platforms. However, when running an SMP\_ON\_UP kernel on a
uniprocessor platform we must take care to preserve the ASID as the
workaround is not required.
This patch ensures that we don't set the ASID to 0 when flushing the TLB
on such a system, preserving the original behaviour with the workaround
disabled.

ARM: 7488/1: mm: use 5 bits for swapfile type encoding
commit f5f2025ef3e2cdb593707cbf87378761f17befbe upstream.
Page migration encodes the pfn in the offset field of a swp\_entry\_t.
For LPAE, we support physical addresses of up to 36 bits (due to
sparsemem limitations with the size of page flags), requiring 24 bits
to represent a pfn. A further 3 bits are used to encode a swp\_entry into
a pte, leaving 5 bits for the type field. Furthermore, the core code
defines MAX\_SWAPFILES\_SHIFT as 5, so the additional type bit does not
get used.
This patch reduces the width of the type field to 5 bits, allowing us
to create up to 31 swapfiles of 64GB each.

ARM: 7487/1: mm: avoid setting nG bit for user mappings that aren't present
commit 47f1204329237a0f8655f5a9f14a38ac81946ca1 upstream.
Swap entries are encoding in ptes such that !pte\_present(pte) and
pte\_file(pte). The remaining bits of the descriptor are used to identify
the swapfile and offset within it to the swap entry.
When writing such a pte for a user virtual address, set\_pte\_at
unconditionally sets the nG bit, which (in the case of LPAE) will
corrupt the swapfile offset and lead to a BUG:
[ 140.494067] swap\_free: Unused swap offset entry 000763b4
[ 140.509989] BUG: Bad page map in process rs:main Q:Reg pte:0ec76800 pmd:8f92e003
This patch fixes the problem by only setting the nG bit for user
mappings that are actually present.
