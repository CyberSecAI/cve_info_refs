Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-1673:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the Mozilla Maintenance Service's (used for Firefox updates on Windows) registry entry not being updated correctly during upgrades. Specifically, the service's binary path in the registry was not enclosed in quotes. This was a regression, as the initial installation of Firefox 12 had this issue, which was fixed in subsequent versions. However, the update process for existing Firefox 12 installations didn't correct this registry entry, leaving these installations vulnerable.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unquoted Service Path:** The primary vulnerability is the use of an unquoted path for the `MozillaMaintenance` service executable in the Windows Registry. This allows for a "planting attack." If an attacker can create a malicious executable in a location that would be part of the service path (e.g., `C:\Program.exe` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\mozilla.exe`), it would be executed by the service during startup with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the unquoted service path, a local user could escalate privileges to SYSTEM level.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This provides complete control over the affected system.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user could gain SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Persistence:** The attacker could potentially establish a persistent backdoor on the system. The malicious executable would be run whenever the service starts (e.g., during an update), allowing for recurring compromise.
*   **Re-compromise:** Even if the initial compromise is removed, the malicious executable could be executed again whenever the service starts, re-compromising the system.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have write access to a location that would be part of the unquoted service path, such as the root directory `C:\` or the `Program Files` directory.
*   **Service Start:** The attack requires the Mozilla Maintenance Service to be started, either manually or automatically (when needed to perform an update).

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write Access to Vulnerable Location:** The attacker must be able to write files to a location that will be part of the service's path.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system. This vulnerability is not triggerable through web content.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the unquoted service path vulnerability and its impact.

**Additional Notes**

*   This vulnerability affects users who installed Firefox versions 12 (and possibly 13) and then upgraded to later versions. Users who did fresh installs of later versions of Firefox were not affected.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that the Mozilla Maintenance Service registry entry is correctly quoted during updates.
*   The vulnerability is considered "high" severity due to the potential for privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
*   This bug report references CVE-2012-1942, which is a related vulnerability related to the updater service itself.
* The fix was applied to Firefox versions 21, 22 and 23. Versions 19, 20 and ESR17 are not affected because they don't have a vulnerable maintenance service.
