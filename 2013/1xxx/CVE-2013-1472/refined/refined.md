Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2013-1472:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the JavaFX component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
*   It's one of multiple vulnerabilities addressed in the February 2013 Oracle Critical Patch Update for Java SE.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The vulnerability allows for remote code execution.
*   The vulnerability does not require authentication for exploitation.
*   It is present in JavaFX 2.2.4 and earlier versions.
*   Specifically identified as a vulnerability within the JavaFX component of JRE.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
*   This could lead to complete compromise of the system, including full control over confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited through untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets.
*   Attackers can use social engineering to entice users to visit malicious websites hosting these applets.
*   Compromised legitimate websites can also be used to host and deliver malicious Java applets (drive-by download attacks).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious Java applet or JNLP file to a vulnerable system. This can be achieved through:
    *   Hosting a malicious applet on a website and tricking the user into visiting it.
    *   Compromising a legitimate website and injecting a malicious applet.
*   No user authentication is required.
*   The attacker needs no special privileges on the target system

**Additional Details**

*   CVSS Base Score: 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).
*   This is part of a broader set of vulnerabilities in JRE addressed by the mentioned updates.
*   The vulnerability impacts client deployments of Java.
*  It affects JavaFX 2.2.4 and prior versions.
* The vulnerability can be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the JavaFX component without using untrusted Java Web Start applications or untrusted Java applets, such as through a web service.
