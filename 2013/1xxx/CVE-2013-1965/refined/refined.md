Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1965:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Apache Struts 2 handles OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) expressions within request parameters, specifically in the context of redirects. While previous fixes addressed OGNL evaluation in parameter names, they did not fully mitigate the risk. The vulnerability allows for a second OGNL evaluation when redirect results are constructed using unsanitized String variables exposed by an action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OGNL Injection:**  A malicious user can inject arbitrary OGNL code into a request parameter.
*   **Double Evaluation:** The injected OGNL code is first placed into a String variable exposed by an action, and then evaluated a second time during the redirect.
*   **Bypass of Protections:** This second evaluation bypasses Struts and OGNL library protections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attack involves crafting a malicious HTTP request containing specially crafted parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know or discover an endpoint that uses a redirect result with a potentially vulnerable expression, such as `${currentSkill.name}`.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious OGNL:** The attacker must be able to craft valid OGNL expressions to be injected.

**More Detail than CVE Description**

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including:

*   **Specific code example** of a vulnerable Struts action definition.
*  **Proof-of-concept steps**: includes a specific URL to trigger the vulnerability, and details about the necessary OGNL payload.
*   **JUnit test case** that simulates the exploit and confirms the vulnerability.
*   **Detailed explanation** of the vulnerability mechanism, including the double evaluation of OGNL expressions and how it circumvents previous fixes.
*   **Affected versions** are clearly listed as Struts Showcase App 2.0.0 - Struts Showcase App 2.3.14.2.
*   **The vulnerability fix:** the OGNLUtil class was changed to deny eval expressions by default.
*   **Red Hat's acknowledgement:** The Red Hat Bugzilla entry clarifies that while Struts 2 is not actively used or enabled in Red Hat products, the `struts2-core` jars were included in some source code packages, posing a risk to customers who built artifacts from that source code.

The information clearly indicates that this vulnerability is exploitable and leads to remote code execution.
