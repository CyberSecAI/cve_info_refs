Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-1590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The NTLMSSP dissector in Wireshark had a buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The dissector was not properly handling the size of data when processing NTLMSSP packets, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash: A successful exploit could cause Wireshark to crash.
- Potential Code Execution: The description mentions that the vulnerability could potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code, though the primary impact described is a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malformed Packets: Attackers could trigger the vulnerability by injecting malformed NTLMSSP packets onto the network.
- Malformed Trace Files: Users could be tricked into opening malicious packet trace files containing the malformed NTLMSSP data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to inject network traffic or create malicious capture files.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same local network, as long as they can send network traffic to the vulnerable system running Wireshark or provide a malicious capture file.

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 1.8.0 to 1.8.4 and 1.6.0 to 1.6.12.

**Fixed Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 1.8.5 and 1.6.13.
