Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-1442:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Xen handles extended processor state components (like the upper halves of YMM registers or AMD's LWP state) when using XSAVE/XRSTOR instructions. Specifically, when a guest increases the set of extended state components after having already used other extended registers (e.g. floating point or XMM), the hypervisor fails to properly clear previous data from those registers, making them accessible without discarding the values an earlier scheduled vCPU may have left in them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Register Clearing:** The core issue is that Xen doesn't clear extended registers before making them available to a new guest, leading to information leakage.
- **Inconsistent State Management:** The inconsistent handling of extended states, where they might not get reset after use, is the underlying vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** A malicious guest OS can potentially read sensitive data from these registers, such as cryptographic keys from other guest OSes that previously used the CPU.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Guest OS Access:** The vulnerability is triggered through the normal process of saving and restoring CPU states during context switches between virtual CPUs (vCPUs) of different guest operating systems running on the Xen hypervisor.
- A malicious guest OS needs to extend the state components saved and restored via XSAVE/XRSTOR after other extended registers have been used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest OS Control:** The attacker needs to have control over a guest OS running on the vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
- **AVX/LWP capable CPU:** The CPU needs to be capable of using AVX or LWP.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Xen 4.0 onwards when running on processors supporting AVX or LWP.
- In Xen 4.0.2 through 4.0.4 and 4.1.x, XSAVE support is disabled by default, so these versions are not vulnerable unless explicitly enabled.
- Systems using processors supporting neither AVX nor LWP are not vulnerable, and Xen 3.x and earlier are also not vulnerable.
- Mitigation is possible by disabling XSAVE support using the `no-xsave` hypervisor command-line option.
