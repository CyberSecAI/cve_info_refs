Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-1914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `getaddrinfo()` function within the GNU C Library (glibc). Specifically, the function does not properly limit the amount of stack memory used during name resolution, leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `getaddrinfo()` function allocates a `struct sort_result results[nresults]` on the stack, where `nresults` is controlled by the nameservice chain (DNS or /etc/hosts). If `nresults` is excessively large, it can overflow the stack.
- Improper handling of large number of domain conversion results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A remote or local attacker can trigger the stack overflow by providing a crafted hostname or IP address that leads to a large number of results from the name resolution process. This can cause the application to crash.
- In some cases, the crash can result in arbitrary code execution, if the application uses the `strtod()`, `strtof()`, or `strtold()` functions on attacker controlled input.
  
**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious hostname or IP address that the vulnerable application resolves using `getaddrinfo()` or related functions (`gethostbyname*()`).
- **Local:** An attacker with local access could also exploit the vulnerability, such as by modifying the `/etc/hosts` file to provide a crafted address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make the vulnerable application resolve a name through the network (DNS) or the local hosts file.
- **Ability to influence name resolution:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the name resolution to return a large number of results. This can be achieved through malicious DNS records or a large `/etc/hosts` entry.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability resides specifically within the `gaih_inet` function of glibc which performs sorting of results. The `struct sort_result results[nresults];` is allocated in the stack.
- The `gethostbyname*()` family of functions can also be exploited if the hostname argument meets specific criteria:
    - Must start with a digit or colon.
    - Must only contain digits and dots or colons.
    - Must resolve to a valid IPv4 address using `inet_aton`.
    - Must be long enough to overflow the allocated buffer (1024 bytes for non-reentrant versions of gethostbyname())
  - When vulnerable the overflow occurs in `__nss_hostname_digits_dots` function, specifically with `strcpy` at line 157.
  - Overflow can happen both locally and remotely,
- The fix introduces a size check before the call to strcpy, fixing the stack overflow.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in glibc versions before 2.18.
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of glibc, but was most dangerous on multithreaded applications with smaller stack sizes.
- Red Hat has rated the severity of this vulnerability as "Moderate".
- The `strtod()`, `strtof()`, and `strtold()` functions are used for converting a string to a numeric representation.

**Mitigation:**
- Updating the glibc library to version 2.18 or later resolves the vulnerability.
- Patches should be applied for affected systems and applications.
- Workarounds are not explicitly stated in the documents provided, but avoiding the use of the vulnerable functions and ensuring proper input sanitization may offer mitigation.

This vulnerability was present for multiple years and existed between glibc-2.2 and glibc-2.18
