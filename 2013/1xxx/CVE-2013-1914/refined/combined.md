Source: <https://www.moxa.com/en/about-us/corporate-responsibility>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2021-39279)
An authenticated command injection vulnerability can be triggered by issuing a
GET request to the "/forms/web_importTFTP" CGI program which is available on
the web interface. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to compromise the
operating system of the device. This issue was found by emulating the firmware
of the device.

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via Manipulated Config-File (CVE-2021-39278)
Via a crafted config-file, a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability can
be exploited in the context of the victim's browser. This config-file can be
uploaded to the device via the "Config Import Export" tab in the main menu.

3) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235)
The used GNU glibc in version 2.9 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235,
gethostbyname "GHOST" buffer overflow) was verified by using the MEDUSA
scalable firmware runtime.

4) Multiple Outdated Software Components
Multiple outdated software components containing vulnerabilities were found by
the IoT Inspector.

The vulnerabilities 1), 2) and 3) were manually verified on an emulated device
by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2021-39279)
The vulnerability can be triggered by navigating in the web interface to the
tab:

"Main Menu"->"Maintenance"->"Config Import Export"

The "TFTP Import" menu is prone to command injection via all parameters. To
exploit the vulnerability, an IP address, a configuration path and a filename
must be set.
If the filename is used to trigger the exploit, the payload in the interceptor
proxy would be:

<http://192.168.1.1/forms/web_importTFTP?servIP=192.168.1.1&configPath=/&fileName=name>|`ping localhost -c 100`

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via Manipulated Config-File (CVE-2021-39278)
The vulnerability can be triggered by navigating in the web interface to the
tab:

"Main Menu"->"Maintenance"->"Config Import Export"

The "Config Import" menu is prone to reflected cross-site scripting via the
upload of config files. Example of malicious config file:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[board]
deviceName="WAC-2004_0000</span><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>"
deviceLocation=""
[..]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uploading such a crafted file triggers cross-site scripting as the erroneous
value is displayed without filtering characters.

3) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235)
GNU glibc version 2.9 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2016-1234, CVE-2015-7547, CVE-2013-7423, CVE-2013-1914, and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the
help of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was
compiled and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

4) Multiple Outdated Software Components
The IoT Inspector recognized multiple outdated software components with known
vulnerabilities:

BusyBox         1.18.5   06/2011
Dropbear SSH    2011.54  11/2011
GNU glibc       2.9      02/2009
Linux Kernel    2.6.27   10/2008
OpenSSL         0.9.7g   04/2005
Only found in the program "iw_director"
OpenSSL         1.0.0    03/2010

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following firmware versions for various devices have been identified
to be vulnerable:
* WAC-2004               / 1.7
* WAC-1001               / 2.1

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=952422#c0)  Jacob Hunt    2013-04-15 23:19:45 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  We have an application that has a lot of threads and uses QReadWriteLocks to protect data that the threads are accessing. When our server is heavily loaded, the application spends about 60% of it's time in system time as opposed to user time. Further investigation showed that the QMutex class is calling sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) for each thread that tries to get a lock where that lock is already locked. Thus most of that system time is spent in this system call.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): glibc-2.12-1.107.el6.x86_64   Additional info: This has been discussed upstream:  <http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2011-06/msg00064.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=952422#c11)  Siddhesh Poyarekar    2013-05-29 06:01:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 754181](attachment.cgi?id=754181&action=diff "Candidate fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=754181&action=edit "Candidate fix") Candidate fix   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=952422#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-21 10:45:08 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1605.html>   ``` |  |

# RHSA-2013:0769 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Low: glibc security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0769)

## Topic

Updated glibc packages that fix two security issues and two bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server
Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without
these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

It was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory
used during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application
resolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause
the application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-1914)

A flaw was found in the regular expression matching routines that process
multibyte character input. If an application utilized the glibc regular
expression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted
input that, when processed, would cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2013-0242)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The improvements RHSA-2012:1207 made to the accuracy of floating point

functions in the math library caused performance regressions for those
functions. The performance regressions were analyzed and a fix was applied
that retains the current accuracy but reduces the performance penalty to
acceptable levels. Refer to Red Hat Knowledge solution 229993, linked
to in the References, for further information. (BZ#950535)

* It was possible that a memory location freed by the localization code

could be accessed immediately after, resulting in a crash. The fix ensures
that the application does not crash by avoiding the invalid memory access.
(BZ#951493)

Users of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=947882#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-04-03 13:33:33 UTC  ``` A stack (frame) overflow flaw, leading to denial of service (application crash), was found in the way getaddrinfo() routine (returning a list of address structures for particular request) of glibc, the collection of GNU libc libraries, processed certain requests. If an application linked against glibc accepted untrusted getaddrinfo() input remotely, a remote attacker could issue a specially-crafted request, which once processed would lead to that application crash.

Subject: CVE Request: glibc getaddrinfo() stack overflow

Hi,

A customer reported a glibc crash, which turned out to be a stack overflow in
getaddrinfo().

getaddrinfo() uses:
	struct sort_result results[nresults];
with nresults controlled by the nameservice chain (DNS or /etc/hosts).

This will be visible mostly on threaded applications with smaller stacksizes,
or operating near out of stack.

Reproducer I tried:
	$ for i in `seq 1 10000000`; do echo "ff00::$i a1" >>/etc/hosts; done
	$ ulimit -s 1024
	$ telnet a1
	Segmentation fault
	(clean out /etc/hosts again )

I am not sure you can usually push this amount of addresses via DNS for all
setups.

Andreas is currently pushing the patch to glibc GIT.

Reference:
<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=813121>

Ciao, Marcus

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=947882#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-04-03 13:33:33 UTC  ``` A stack (frame) overflow flaw, leading to denial of service (application crash), was found in the way getaddrinfo() routine (returning a list of address structures for particular request) of glibc, the collection of GNU libc libraries, processed certain requests. If an application linked against glibc accepted untrusted getaddrinfo() input remotely, a remote attacker could issue a specially-crafted request, which once processed would lead to that application crash.  References: [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=813121> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/04/03/2>  Proposed Novell patch: [3] <http://bugzillafiles.novell.org/attachment.cgi?id=533210>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=947882#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-04-03 13:35:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 731167](attachment.cgi?id=731167&action=diff "Local copy of proposed patch by Novell") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=731167&action=edit "Local copy of proposed patch by Novell") Local copy of proposed patch by Novell   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=947882#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-04-03 13:37:18 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the glibc package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the glibc package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17 and 18.

The application stack overflow results in a crash but requires poisoning DNS. We will wait for a more thorough upstream review and test before fixing this in all of Fedora.  Given the low priority we will fix this as required in RHEL.  If anyone has an objection to this plan of action please speak up with comments about why this should be higher than low priority and low severity.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2013:1605 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: glibc security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1605)

## Topic

Updated glibc packages that fix three security issues, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server
Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without
these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
were found in glibc's memory allocator functions (pvalloc, valloc, and
memalign). If an application used such a function, it could cause the
application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2013-4332)

A flaw was found in the regular expression matching routines that process
multibyte character input. If an application utilized the glibc regular
expression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted
input that, when processed, would cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2013-0242)

It was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory
used during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application
resolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause
the application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-1914)

Among other changes, this update includes an important fix for the following
bug:

* Due to a defect in the initial release of the getaddrinfo() system call in Red

Hat enterprise Linux 6.0, AF\_INET and AF\_INET6 queries resolved from the
/etc/hosts file returned queried names as canonical names. This incorrect
behavior is, however, still considered to be the expected behavior. As a result
of a recent change in getaddrinfo(), AF\_INET6 queries started resolving the
canonical names correctly. However, this behavior was unexpected by applications
that relied on queries resolved from the /etc/hosts file, and these applications
could thus fail to operate properly. This update applies a fix ensuring that
AF\_INET6 queries resolved from /etc/hosts always return the queried name as
canonical. Note that DNS lookups are resolved properly and always return the
correct canonical names. A proper fix to AF\_INET6 queries resolution from
/etc/hosts may be applied in future releases; for now, due to a lack of
standard, Red Hat suggests the first entry in the /etc/hosts file, that applies
for the IP address being resolved, to be considered the canonical entry.
(BZ#1022022)

These updated glibc packages also include additional bug fixes and
various enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes
in this advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5
Technical Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the
most significant of these changes.

All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

Yes, this is with the TCP transport.  With a suitably prepared zone, I
can get up to

$ getent hosts  ... | wc -l
4093

A records (over DNS, just to be clear).

Qualys Security Advisory CVE-2015-0235

GHOST: glibc gethostbyname buffer overflow

--[ Contents ]----------------------------------------------------------------

--[ 1 - Summary ]-------------------------------------------------------------

During a code audit performed internally at Qualys, we discovered a
buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots() function of the GNU
C Library (glibc). This bug is reachable both locally and remotely via
the gethostbyname*() functions, so we decided to analyze it -- and its
impact -- thoroughly, and named this vulnerability "GHOST".

Our main conclusions are:

- Via gethostbyname() or gethostbyname2(), the overflowed buffer is
  located in the heap. Via gethostbyname_r() or gethostbyname2_r(), the
  overflowed buffer is caller-supplied (and may therefore be located in
  the heap, stack, .data, .bss, etc; however, we have seen no such call
  in practice).

- At most sizeof(char *) bytes can be overwritten (ie, 4 bytes on 32-bit
  machines, and 8 bytes on 64-bit machines). Bytes can be overwritten
  only with digits ('0'...'9'), dots ('.'), and a terminating null
  character ('\0').

- Despite these limitations, arbitrary code execution can be achieved.
  As a proof of concept, we developed a full-fledged remote exploit
  against the Exim mail server, bypassing all existing protections
  (ASLR, PIE, and NX) on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines. We will
  publish our exploit as a Metasploit module in the near future.

- The first vulnerable version of the GNU C Library is glibc-2.2,
  released on November 10, 2000.

- We identified a number of factors that mitigate the impact of this
  bug. In particular, we discovered that it was fixed on May 21, 2013
  (between the releases of glibc-2.17 and glibc-2.18). Unfortunately, it
  was not recognized as a security threat; as a result, most stable and
  long-term-support distributions were left exposed (and still are):
  Debian 7 (wheezy), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 & 7, CentOS 6 & 7,
  Ubuntu 12.04, for example.

--[ 2 - Analysis ]------------------------------------------------------------

The vulnerable function, __nss_hostname_digits_dots(), is called
internally by the glibc in nss/getXXbyYY.c (the non-reentrant version)
and nss/getXXbyYY_r.c (the reentrant version). However, the calls are
surrounded by #ifdef HANDLE_DIGITS_DOTS, a macro defined only in:

- inet/gethstbynm.c
- inet/gethstbynm2.c
- inet/gethstbynm_r.c
- inet/gethstbynm2_r.c
- nscd/gethstbynm3_r.c

These files implement the gethostbyname*() family, and hence the only
way to reach __nss_hostname_digits_dots() and its buffer overflow. The
purpose of this function is to avoid expensive DNS lookups if the
hostname argument is already an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

The code below comes from glibc-2.17:

 35 int
 36 __nss_hostname_digits_dots (const char *name, struct hostent *resbuf,
 37                             char **buffer, size_t *buffer_size,
 38                             size_t buflen, struct hostent **result,
 39                             enum nss_status *status, int af, int *h_errnop)
 40 {
 ..
 57   if (isdigit (name[0]) || isxdigit (name[0]) || name[0] == ':')
 58     {
 59       const char *cp;
 60       char *hostname;
 61       typedef unsigned char host_addr_t[16];
 62       host_addr_t *host_addr;
 63       typedef char *host_addr_list_t[2];
 64       host_addr_list_t *h_addr_ptrs;
 65       char **h_alias_ptr;
 66       size_t size_needed;
 ..
 85       size_needed = (sizeof (*host_addr)
 86                      + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) + strlen (name) + 1);
 87
 88       if (buffer_size == NULL)
 89         {
 90           if (buflen < size_needed)
 91             {
 ..
 95               goto done;
 96             }
 97         }
 98       else if (buffer_size != NULL && *buffer_size < size_needed)
 99         {
100           char *new_buf;
101           *buffer_size = size_needed;
102           new_buf = (char *) realloc (*buffer, *buffer_size);
103
104           if (new_buf == NULL)
105             {
...
114               goto done;
115             }
116           *buffer = new_buf;
117         }
...
121       host_addr = (host_addr_t *) *buffer;
122       h_addr_ptrs = (host_addr_list_t *)
123         ((char *) host_addr + sizeof (*host_addr));
124       h_alias_ptr = (char **) ((char *) h_addr_ptrs + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs));
125       hostname = (char *) h_alias_ptr + sizeof (*h_alias_ptr);
126
127       if (isdigit (name[0]))
128         {
129           for (cp = name;; ++cp)
130             {
131               if (*cp == '\0')
132                 {
133                   int ok;
134
135                   if (*--cp == '.')
136                     break;
...
142                   if (af == AF_INET)
143                     ok = __inet_aton (name, (struct in_addr *) host_addr);
144                   else
145                     {
146                       assert (af == AF_INET6);
147                       ok = inet_pton (af, name, host_addr) > 0;
148                     }
149                   if (! ok)
150                     {
...
154                       goto done;
155                     }
156
157                   resbuf->h_name = strcpy (hostname, name);
...
194                   goto done;
195                 }
196
197               if (!isdigit (*cp) && *cp != '.')
198                 break;
199             }
200         }
...

Lines 85-86 compute the size_needed to store three (3) distinct entities
in buffer: host_addr, h_addr_ptrs, and name (the hostname). Lines 88-117
make sure the buffer is large enough: lines 88-97 correspond to the
reentrant case, lines 98-117 to the non-reentrant case.

Lines 121-125 prepare pointers to store four (4) distinct entities in
buffer: host_addr, h_addr_ptrs, h_alias_ptr, and hostname. The sizeof
(*h_alias_ptr) -- the size of a char pointer -- is missing from the
computation of size_needed.

The strcpy() on line 157 should therefore allow us to write past the end
of buffer, at most (depending on strlen(name) and alignment) 4 bytes on
32-bit machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines. There is a similar
strcpy() after line 200, but no buffer overflow:

236           size_needed = (sizeof (*host_addr)
237                          + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) + strlen (name) + 1);
...
267           host_addr = (host_addr_t *) *buffer;
268           h_addr_ptrs = (host_addr_list_t *)
269             ((char *) host_addr + sizeof (*host_addr));
270           hostname = (char *) h_addr_ptrs + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs);
...
289                   resbuf->h_name = strcpy (hostname, name);

In order to reach the overflow at line 157, the hostname argument must
meet the following requirements:

- Its first character must be a digit (line 127).

- Its last character must not be a dot (line 135).

- It must comprise only digits and dots (line 197) (we call this the
  "digits-and-dots" requirement).

- It must be long enough to overflow the buffer. For example, the
  non-reentrant gethostbyname*() functions initially allocate their
  buffer with a call to malloc(1024) (the "1-KB" requirement).

- It must be successfully parsed as an IPv4 address by inet_aton() (line
  143), or as an IPv6 address by inet_pton() (line 147). Upon careful
  analysis of these two functions, we can further refine this
  "inet-aton" requirement:

  . It is impossible to successfully parse a "digits-and-dots" hostname
    as an IPv6 address with inet_pton() (':' is forbidden). Hence it is
    impossible to reach the overflow with calls to gethostbyname2() or
    gethostbyname2_r() if the address family argument is AF_INET6.

  . Conclusion: inet_aton() is the only option, and the hostname must
    have one of the following forms: "a.b.c.d", "a.b.c", "a.b", or "a",
    where a, b, c, d must be unsigned integers, at most 0xfffffffful,
    converted successfully (ie, no integer overflow) by strtoul() in
    decimal or octal (but not hexadecimal, because 'x' and 'X' are
    forbidden).

--[ 3 - Mitigating factors ]--------------------------------------------------

The impact of this bug is reduced significantly by the following
reasons:

- A patch already exists (since May 21, 2013), and has been applied and
  tested since glibc-2.18, released on August 12, 2013:

        [BZ #15014]
        * nss/getXXbyYY_r.c (INTERNAL (REENTRANT_NAME))
        [HANDLE_DIGITS_DOTS]: Set any_service when digits-dots parsing was
        successful.
        * nss/digits_dots.c (__nss_hostname_digits_dots): Remove
        redundant variable declarations and reallocation of buffer when
        parsing as IPv6 address.  Always set NSS status when called from
        reentrant functions.  Use NETDB_INTERNAL instead of TRY_AGAIN when
        buffer too small.  Correct computation of needed size.
        * nss/Makefile (tests): Add test-digits-dots.
        * nss/test-digits-dots.c: New test.

- The gethostbyname*() functions are obsolete; with the advent of IPv6,
  recent applications use getaddrinfo() instead.

- Many programs, especially SUID binaries reachable locally, use
  gethostbyname() if, and only if, a preliminary call to inet_aton()
  fails. However, a subsequent call must also succeed (the "inet-aton"
  requirement) in order to reach the overflow: this is impossible, and
  such programs are therefore safe.

- Most of the other programs, especially servers reachable remotely, use
  gethostbyname() to perform forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS, also
  known as full-circle reverse DNS) checks. These programs are generally
  safe, because the hostname passed to gethostbyname() has normally been
  pre-validated by DNS software:

  . "a string of labels each containing up to 63 8-bit octets, separated
    by dots, and with a maximum total of 255 octets." This makes it
    impossible to satisfy the "1-KB" requirement.

  . Actually, glibc's DNS resolver can produce hostnames of up to
    (almost) 1025 characters (in case of bit-string labels, and special
    or non-printable characters). But this introduces backslashes ('\\')
    and makes it impossible to satisfy the "digits-and-dots"
    requirement.

--[ 4 - Case studies ]--------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will analyze real-world examples of programs that
call the gethostbyname*() functions, but we first introduce a small test
program that checks whether a system is vulnerable or not:

----[ 4.1 - The GNU C Library ]-----------------------------------------------

The glibc itself contains a few calls to gethostbyname*() functions. In
particular, getaddrinfo() calls gethostbyname2_r() if, but only if, a
first call to inet_aton() fails: in accordance with the "inet-aton"
requirement, these internal calls are safe. For example,
eglibc-2.13/sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c:

      at->family = AF_UNSPEC;
      ...
      if (__inet_aton (name, (struct in_addr *) at->addr) != 0)
        {
          if (req->ai_family == AF_UNSPEC || req->ai_family == AF_INET)
            at->family = AF_INET;
          else if (req->ai_family == AF_INET6 && (req->ai_flags & AI_V4MAPPED))
            {
              ...
              at->family = AF_INET6;
            }
          else
            return -EAI_ADDRFAMILY;
          ...
        }
      ...
      if (at->family == AF_UNSPEC && (req->ai_flags & AI_NUMERICHOST) == 0)
        {
          ...
              size_t tmpbuflen = 512;
              char *tmpbuf = alloca (tmpbuflen);
              ...
                  rc = __gethostbyname2_r (name, family, &th, tmpbuf,
                                           tmpbuflen, &h, &herrno);
          ...
        }

----[ 4.2 - mount.nfs ]-------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, mount.nfs (a SUID-root binary) is not vulnerable:

        if (inet_aton(hostname, &addr->sin_addr))
                return 0;
        if ((hp = gethostbyname(hostname)) == NULL) {
                nfs_error(_("%s: can't get address for %s\n"),
                                progname, hostname);
                return -1;
        }

----[ 4.3 - mtr ]-------------------------------------------------------------

mtr (another SUID-root binary) is not vulnerable either, because it
calls getaddrinfo() instead of gethostbyname*() functions on any modern
(ie, IPv6-enabled) system:

#ifdef ENABLE_IPV6
  /* gethostbyname2() is deprecated so we'll use getaddrinfo() instead. */
  ...
  error = getaddrinfo( Hostname, NULL, &hints, &res );
  if ( error ) {
    if (error == EAI_SYSTEM)
       perror ("Failed to resolve host");
    else
       fprintf (stderr, "Failed to resolve host: %s\n", gai_strerror(error));
    exit( EXIT_FAILURE );
  }
  ...
#else
    host = gethostbyname(Hostname);
  if (host == NULL) {
    herror("mtr gethostbyname");
    exit(1);
  }
  ...
#endif

----[ 4.4 - iputils ]---------------------------------------------------------

------[ 4.4.1 - clockdiff ]---------------------------------------------------

clockdiff is vulnerable in a straightforward manner:

        hp = gethostbyname(argv[1]);
        if (hp == NULL) {
                fprintf(stderr, "clockdiff: %s: host not found\n", argv[1]);
                exit(1);
        }

------[ 4.4.2 - ping and arping ]---------------------------------------------

ping and arping call gethostbyname() and gethostbyname2(), respectively,
if and only if inet_aton() fails first. This time, however, there is
another function call in between (Fedora, for example, does define
USE_IDN):

--------[ 4.4.2.1 - ping ]----------------------------------------------------

                if (inet_aton(target, &whereto.sin_addr) == 1) {
                        ...
                } else {
                        char *idn;
#ifdef USE_IDN
                        int rc;
                        ...
                        rc = idna_to_ascii_lz(target, &idn, 0);
                        if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS) {
                                fprintf(stderr, "ping: IDN encoding failed: %s\n", idna_strerror(rc));
                                exit(2);
                        }
#else
                        idn = target;
#endif
                        hp = gethostbyname(idn);

--------[ 4.4.2.2 - arping ]--------------------------------------------------

        if (inet_aton(target, &dst) != 1) {
                struct hostent *hp;
                char *idn = target;
#ifdef USE_IDN
                int rc;

                rc = idna_to_ascii_lz(target, &idn, 0);

                if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS) {
                        fprintf(stderr, "arping: IDN encoding failed: %s\n", idna_strerror(rc));
                        exit(2);
                }
#endif

                hp = gethostbyname2(idn, AF_INET);

--------[ 4.4.2.3 - Analysis ]------------------------------------------------

If idna_to_ascii_lz() modifies the target hostname, the first call to
inet_aton() could fail and the second call (internal to gethostbyname())
could succeed. For example, idna_to_ascii_lz() transforms any Unicode
dot-like character (0x3002, 0xFF0E, 0xFF61) into an ASCII dot (".").

But it also restricts the length of a domain label to 63 characters:
this makes it impossible to reach 1024 bytes (the "1-KB" requirement)
with only 4 labels and 3 dots (the "inet-aton" requirement).

Unless inet_aton() (actually, strtoul()) can be tricked into accepting
more than 3 dots? Indeed, idna_to_ascii_lz() does not restrict the total
length of a domain name. glibc supports "thousands' grouping characters"
(man 3 printf); for example, sscanf(str, "%'lu", &ul) yields 1000 when
processing any of the following input strings:

- "1,000" in an English locale;
- "1 000" in a French locale; and
- "1.000" in a German or Spanish locale.

strtoul() implements this "number grouping" too, but its use is limited
to internal glibc functions. Conclusion: more than 3 dots is impossible,
and neither ping nor arping is vulnerable.

----[ 4.5 - procmail ]--------------------------------------------------------

procmail (a SUID-root and SGID-mail binary) is vulnerable through its
"comsat/biff" feature:

#define COMSAThost      "localhost"    /* where the biff/comsat daemon lives */
...
#define SERV_ADDRsep    '@'           /* when overriding in COMSAT=serv@addr */

int setcomsat(chp)const char*chp;
{ char*chad; ...
  chad=strchr(chp,SERV_ADDRsep);                             /* @ separator? */
  ...
  if(chad)
     *chad++='\0';                                    /* split the specifier */
  if(!chad||!*chad)                                               /* no host */
#ifndef IP_localhost                          /* Is "localhost" preresolved? */
     chad=COMSAThost;                                   /* nope, use default */
#else /* IP_localhost */
   { ...
   }
  else
#endif /* IP_localhost */
   { ...
     if(!(host=gethostbyname(chad))||!host->h_0addr_list)

----[ 4.6 - pppd ]------------------------------------------------------------

pppd (yet another SUID-root binary) calls gethostbyname() if a
preliminary call to inet_addr() (a simple wrapper around inet_aton())
fails. "The inet_addr() function converts the Internet host address cp
from IPv4 numbers-and-dots notation into binary data in network byte
order. If the input is invalid, INADDR_NONE (usually -1) is returned.
Use of this function is problematic because -1 is a valid address
(255.255.255.255)." A failure for inet_addr(), but a success for
inet_aton(), and consequently a path to the buffer overflow.

--[ 5 - Exploitation ]--------------------------------------------------------

----[ 5.1 - Code execution ]--------------------------------------------------

In this section, we describe how we achieve remote code execution
against the Exim SMTP mail server, bypassing the NX (No-eXecute)
protection and glibc's malloc hardening.

First, we overflow gethostbyname's heap-based buffer and partially
overwrite the size field of the next contiguous free chunk of memory
with a slightly larger size (we overwrite only 3 bytes of the size
field; in any case, we cannot overflow more than 4 bytes on 32-bit
machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines):

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |
-----|----------------------|---+--------------------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| free chunk | ...
-----|----------------------|---+--------------------|-----
     |                         X|
     |------------------------->|
               overflow

where:

struct malloc_chunk {

  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      prev_size;  /* Size of previous chunk (if free).  */
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      size;       /* Size in bytes, including overhead. */

  struct malloc_chunk* fd;         /* double links -- used only if free. */
  struct malloc_chunk* bk;

  /* Only used for large blocks: pointer to next larger size.  */
  struct malloc_chunk* fd_nextsize; /* double links -- used only if free. */
  struct malloc_chunk* bk_nextsize;
};

and: X marks the spot where the crucial memory corruption takes place.

As a result, this artificially-enlarged free chunk, which is managed by
glibc's malloc, overlaps another block of memory, Exim's current_block,
which is managed by Exim's internal memory allocator:

                            |< malloc_chunk          |< storeblock
                            |                        |
-----|----------------------|------------------------|---------------+---|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| free chunk |n|l| current_block | ...
-----|----------------------|------------------------|---------------+---|-----
                            |                                        |
                            |<-------------------------------------->|
                                 artificially enlarged free chunk

where:

typedef struct storeblock {
  struct storeblock *next;
  size_t length;
} storeblock;

Then, we partially allocate the enlarged free chunk and overwrite the
beginning of Exim's current_block of memory (the "storeblock" structure)
with arbitrary data. In particular, we overwrite its "next" field:

                            |< malloc_chunk          |< storeblock
                            |                        |
-----|----------------------|------------------------|--------+----------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| aaaaaaaaaa |n|l| current_block | ...
-----|----------------------|------------------------|--------+----------|-----
                            |                         X       |
                            |<------------------------------->|
                                      allocated chunk

This effectively turns gethostbyname's buffer overflow into a
write-anything-anywhere primitive, because we control both the pointer
to the next block of memory returned by Exim's allocator (the hijacked
"next" pointer) and the data allocated (a null-terminated string, the
argument of an SMTP command we send to Exim).

Finally, we use this write-anything-anywhere primitive to overwrite
Exim's run-time configuration, which is cached in the heap memory. More
precisely, we overwrite Exim's Access Control Lists (ACLs), and achieve
arbitrary command execution thanks to Exim's "${run{<command> <args>}}"
string expansion mechanism:

                                                     |< storeblock
                                                     |
-----|-------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----
 ... | Exim's run-time configuration | ... .. .. ... |n|l| current_block | ...
-----|----x--------------------------|---------------|x------------------|-----
          |                                           |
          '<------------------------------------------'
                      hijacked next pointer

                |< ACLs >|
-----|----+-----+--------+------+----|---------------|-------------------|-----
 ... | Exim's run-time configuration | ... .. .. ... | old current_block | ...
-----|----+-----+--------+------+----|---------------|-------------------|-----
          |      XXXXXXXX       |
          |<------------------->|
             new current_block

----[ 5.2 - Information leak ]------------------------------------------------

The success of this exploit depends on an important piece of
information: the address of Exim's run-time configuration in the heap.
In this section, we describe how we obtain this address, bypassing the
ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and PIE (Position Independent
Executable) protections.

First, we overflow gethostbyname's heap-based buffer and partially
overwrite the size field of the next contiguous free chunk of memory
with a slightly larger size:

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |
-----|----------------------|---+-------------------------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| next free chunk | ...
-----|----------------------|---+-------------------------|-----
     |                         X|
     |------------------------->|
               overflow

As a result, this artificially-enlarged free chunk overlaps another
block of memory, where Exim saves the error message "503 sender not yet
given\r\n" for later use:

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |
-----|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------+----|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| real free chunk | error message | ...
-----|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------+----|-----
                            |                                        |
                            |<-------------------------------------->|
                                 artificially enlarged free chunk

Then, we partially allocate the artificially-enlarged free chunk,
thereby splitting it in two: the newly allocated chunk, and a smaller,
free chunk (the remainder from the split). The malloc_chunk header for
this remaining free chunk overwrites the very beginning of the saved
error message with a pointer to the heap (the fd_nextsize pointer):

                            |< malloc_chunk       |< malloc_chunk
                            |                     |
-----|----------------------|---------------------+-------|----------+----|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| aaaaaaa |p|s|f|b|F|B| r message | ...
-----|----------------------|---------------------+-------|----------+----|-----
                            |                     |        X         |
                            |<------------------->|<---------------->|
                                allocated chunk        free chunk

Finally, we send an invalid SMTP command to Exim, and retrieve the
fd_nextsize heap pointer from Exim's SMTP response, which includes the
corrupted error message. This effectively turns gethostbyname's buffer
overflow into an information leak; moreover, it allows us to distinguish
between 32-bit and 64-bit machines.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# RHSA-2012:1207 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: glibc security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1207)

## Topic

Updated glibc packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C and standard math libraries used
by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux
system cannot function properly.

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to stack-based buffer overflows,
were found in glibc's functions for converting a string to a numeric
representation (strtod(), strtof(), and strtold()). If an application used
such a function on attacker controlled input, it could cause the
application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-3480)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, logic errors in various mathematical functions, including

exp, exp2, expf, exp2f, pow, sin, tan, and rint, caused inconsistent
results when the functions were used with the non-default rounding mode.
This could also cause applications to crash in some cases. With this
update, the functions now give correct results across the four different
rounding modes. (BZ#839411)

All users of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>
