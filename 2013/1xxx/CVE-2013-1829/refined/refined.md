Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper capability checks in the Moodle calendar subscription feature. Specifically, users without the necessary permissions to manage calendar subscriptions were still able to see the controls for updating these subscriptions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate capability checks: The system failed to verify if a user had the required permissions before displaying the controls for calendar subscription management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Minor Impact**: While users could see the controls, they could not actually modify the calendar subscriptions, making it a minor issue. The primary impact was the display of elements that should have been hidden for users lacking the right permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack vector involves direct interaction with the Moodle calendar interface. An attacker would need to log in as a user without the required capabilities for managing calendar subscriptions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs a valid user account on the affected Moodle system.
-   The attacker's user account must lack the permission to manage calendar subscriptions.

**Affected Versions:**
- Moodle versions 2.4 to 2.4.1 are affected.

**Fixed Versions:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Moodle versions 2.4.2 and 2.4.3.

**Additional Information:**
-   The issue was reported by Ankit Agarwal.
-   The Moodle issue tracker ID is MDL-37338.
-   A workaround is to avoid course and group calendar subscriptions.
