The provided content discusses vulnerabilities in the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol, specifically focusing on flaws found in the Portable UPnP SDK and MiniUPnP software libraries. While the article mentions multiple vulnerabilities discovered, it does not specifically mention CVE-2013-1461. The CVE is mentioned in the context of the UPnP M-SEARCH module in Metasploit output, which would be an indicator of the module being able to detect the specific vulnerability.

Based on the information provided:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in the implementation of UPnP libraries, specifically the Portable UPnP SDK and MiniUPnP, which contain remotely exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The Portable UPnP SDK contained a vulnerability allowing remote code execution via a single UDP packet.
- MiniUPnP had vulnerabilities that, while fixed two years prior to the article, were still present in over 330 products. The article references CVE-2013-0229 and CVE-2013-0230 as examples of flaws found in MiniUPnP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to remote code execution, potentially allowing attackers to compromise network devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities via the internet or within a local network that has internet exposure by sending specially crafted UPnP discovery requests, specifically via UDP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to vulnerable devices, either from the internet or a compromised machine within the local network.

The content provides more detailed information about the scale of the problem, the affected software libraries, and the available tooling to detect and test for these vulnerabilities. It mentions 80 million unique IPs responding to UPnP discovery requests and 40 to 50 million being vulnerable to at least one of the attacks. It also mentions a tool called ScanNow UPnP, and using Metasploit to identify vulnerable systems.
