Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Jockey's unsafe usage of polkit. Specifically, it incorrectly uses the process ID (PID) instead of the system bus name when interacting with PolicyKit for authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Polkit Subject:** Jockey was passing the process ID (PID) as the subject to polkit. This is problematic because PIDs can be reused.
*   **Race Condition:** This incorrect use of the PID created a race condition vulnerability. A local attacker could potentially exploit this race condition to bypass intended polkit authorizations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit could allow a local attacker to bypass the authorization policies enforced by polkit, leading to unauthorized actions, potentially resulting in privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the vulnerable system.
*   **Ability to Trigger Race:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the system in such a way as to exploit the race condition in Jockey's interaction with polkit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects the `jockey` package, specifically the `jockey/backend.py` file.
*   The fix involves passing the system-bus-name instead of the PID as the subject to polkit. This allows polkit to correctly retrieve information from the system bus.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in `jockey-common` package version `0.9.7-0ubuntu7.11` for Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise).
*   The fix is considered a security update and is of low urgency.
