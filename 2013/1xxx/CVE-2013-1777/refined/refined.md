Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A misconfigured RMI classloader in Apache Geronimo 3.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The RMI classloader is not properly configured, allowing for potential exploitation.
- Insecure deserialization: The vulnerability stems from the ability to send a serialized object via JMX.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could send a malicious serialized object via JMX, potentially compromising the system. This could lead to remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted serialized object via JMX.
- Exploiting the misconfigured RMI classloader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the JMX port of the Apache Geronimo instance (port 9999). Access to this port or having the possibility to send requests is the attacker's requirement.
-  The attacker must have the ability to send a serialized object.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Apache Geronimo versions 3.0.0, 3.0 Beta 1, and 3.0 M1.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Geronimo 3.0.1.
- The vulnerability is tracked by JIRA issue [GERONIMO-6477](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-6477).
- Workarounds include hiding the naming (1099) and JMX (9999) ports behind a firewall or binding the ports to a local network interface.
- The IBM support page mentions this vulnerability is also present in WebSphere Application Server Community Edition 3.0.0.3.
