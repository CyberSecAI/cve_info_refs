Geronimo Server:CVE-2013-1777: RMI classloader exposure A misconfigured RMI classloader in Apache Geronimo 3.0 may enable an attacker to send a serialized object via JMX that could compromise the system.  Geronimo 3.0, Beta 1 or M1 users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to Geronimo 3.0.1.  Remote exploits can be prevented by hiding the naming (1099) and JMX (9999) ports behind a firewall or binding the ports to a local network interface.
