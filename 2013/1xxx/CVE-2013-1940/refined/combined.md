Subject: Xorg-x11-server: Information disclosure due enabling events from
 hot-plug devices despite input from the device being momentarily disabled

Hi All,

David Airlie and Peter Hutterer of Red Hat found an information
disclosure flaw was found in the way X.org X11 server used to register
new hot-plug devices, when X.org X11 server was instructed (for that
particular moment) not to receive input devices events. Formerly when
registering new input device, X.org X11 server simultaneously enabled
retrieval of input from the particular device (regardless of the
setting).
A local unsuspecting user, relying on the X.org X11 server disable
input feature it to properly prohibit acquiring of events from this
newly added hot-plug device, could supply a sensitive information that,
due the above bug, would become available to the physically proximate
attackers.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2013-1940

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2661-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Yves-Alexis Perez

Package        : xorg-server
Vulnerability  : information disclosure
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1940

David Airlie and Peter Hutterer of Red Hat discovered that xorg-server,
the Xorg X server was vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw
related to input handling and devices hotplug.

When an X server is running but not on front (for example because of a VT
switch), a newly plugged input device would still be recognized and
handled by the X server, which would actually transmit input events to
its clients on the background.

This could allow an attacker to recover some input events not intended
for the X clients, including sensitive information.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.7.7-16.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.4-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.4-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=63353#c0)  Peter Hutterer    2013-04-10 04:52:47 UTC  ``` Summary: In some cases, input events are sent to X servers not currently active, allowing a user to capture passwords.  Affected: all versions since X server 1.4 (inclusive) I think  Synopsis: If a user vt-switches away from X to a tty, all current input devices are disabled and the server will not receive events for them until the user vt-switches back.  In the default configuration, the X server is configured to support input device hotplugging through udev or HAL. If such an event is received while the server is vt-switched away, the server enables the new device. Events from that device will be received and processed by the server.  Reproducer (with a tty) 1) start X, open a text editor 2) vt-switch to a tty 3) plug in a USB keyboard 4) use this keyboard to log in on the tty 5) vt-switch back to X 6) user + pwd are visible in the text editor  Reproducer (with fast-user switching) 1) select "Switch User" in the GNOME3 top-right menu 2) log in as second user, open text editor 3) vt-switch to first X instance 4) type password to log in as your user 5) vt-switch to second X instance 6) password visible in text editor  or:  1) as above 2) vt-switch back to initial user 3) open text editor 4) vt-switch to gdm window, wait for a user to log in 5) vt-switch to second X instance 6) password visible in text editor  The above works not only for a new device, simply unplugging and re-plugging the existing keyboard will do.  Solution: The server must determine if it is the VT owner when the new device notification is received. If it is not the VT owner, it may add, but must not enable the new device.   No upstream patches available at this point.  CVE-2013-1940 has been assigned to this issue. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=63353#c1)  Dave Airlie    2013-04-10 06:12:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 77717](attachment.cgi?id=77717 "patch to fix flush input") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=77717&action=edit "patch to fix flush input") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=63353&attachment=77717) patch to fix flush input  This fixes the input flush code to use a larger buffer size so we can drain evdev events. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=63353#c2)  Peter Hutterer    2013-04-10 06:12:31 UTC  ``` Correction, the interpretation of the cause was wrong. The server _does_ check whether it is the VT owner and does not enable the device. So this part of the server is correct.  The events are sent after VT-switching back because they're still on the fd. When the next event comes on that fd, the driver reads all events off the wire and thus processes the ones from before vt-switching back too. The evdev driver does call xf86FlushInput() to ditch these events, but xf86FlushInput() is the real bug: it reads 4 bytes off the fd until there is none left. The kernel will not write into a buffer smaller than sizeof(struct input_event), the events aren't discarded and show up with the next input from that device. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=63353#c3)  Dave Airlie    2013-04-10 06:13:13 UTC  ``` This is most likely a Linux only problem. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=63353#c4)  Peter Hutterer    2013-04-10 06:25:42 UTC  ``` This only happens with the evdev driver.  evdev keeps the fd open between PreInit and DEVICE_ON, which is how these events accumulate in the first place. other drivers open and close the fd in PreInit and then re-open it for DEVICE_ON. A quick git log shows this behaviour has been there since at least evdev 2.0. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=63353#c5)  Peter Hutterer    2013-04-10 06:32:40 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 77717](attachment.cgi?id=77717 "patch to fix flush input") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=77717&action=edit "patch to fix flush input") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=63353&attachment=77717) patch to fix flush input  Review of [attachment 77717](attachment.cgi?id=77717 "patch to fix flush input") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=77717&action=edit "patch to fix flush input") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=63353&attachment=77717): -----------------------------------------------------------------  Reviewed-by: Peter Hutterer <peter.hutterer@who-t.net> ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=63353#c6)  Peter Hutterer    2013-04-11 01:52:26 UTC  ``` CC-ing stable branch maintainer ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=63353#c7)  Peter Hutterer    2013-04-11 03:02:23 UTC  ``` Embargo date 17 April ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=63353#c8)  Peter Hutterer    2013-04-17 05:20:12 UTC  ``` This issue is public now. <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2013-1940>   commit 6ca03b9161d33b1d2b55a3a1a913cf88deb2343f Author: Dave Airlie <airlied@gmail.com> Date:   Wed Apr 10 16:09:01 2013 +1000      xf86: fix flush input to work with Linux evdev devices. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=63353#c9)  Peter Hutterer    2013-04-17 07:41:25 UTC  ``` xorg-server-1.13.4 and xorg-server-1.14.1 have been released with the fixes for this issue.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
