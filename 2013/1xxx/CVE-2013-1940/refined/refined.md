Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1940:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the X.Org X server handles input events from hot-plugged devices, specifically when the server is not the active VT owner (e.g., when a user has switched to a different virtual terminal). When a new input device is hot-plugged, the server incorrectly enabled the device even if it was supposed to be disabled. This occurs because the `xf86FlushInput` function in `hw/xfree86/os-support/shared/posix_tty.c` was not properly discarding events from the device's file descriptor. The server wasn't actually enabling the device when it wasn't supposed to, but rather, it was failing to discard buffered input events that occurred before switching VT's. This allowed an accumulation of input events on the file descriptor, which would then be processed when the VT was switched back. This issue is specific to the `evdev` driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is an information disclosure. Input events, including keystrokes, from a hot-plugged device (like a keyboard) could be captured by a user on a different VT/X session because the input was not being discarded.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The server does not properly clear input buffers associated with inactive devices when it is not the VT owner using the `xf86FlushInput` function with Linux evdev devices

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Keystroke Capture:** A local attacker with physical access could plug in a new keyboard, switch to a different VT or user, and capture keystrokes (potentially including passwords or other sensitive data) entered on the newly plugged device when switching back.
*   **Data Exposure:** This can lead to sensitive information being exposed to an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the target machine to hot-plug an input device.
*   **Local Account:** The attacker needs to have an account on the system or otherwise be able to start an app listening for key events.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker must be physically proximate to the target machine to plug in a device.
*   **VT Switching Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to switch between VTs or X sessions.
*   **Unlocked Screen:** The victim must have switched away from their X session without locking the screen.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the `xf86FlushInput` function reads only 4 bytes from the file descriptor while kernel input events are larger than that (sizeof(struct input_event)). This leads to the accumulation of events on the file descriptor.
*   The issue is specific to the `evdev` driver which keeps the file descriptor open.
*   The fix involves using a larger buffer size in `xf86FlushInput` to properly drain evdev events.
*   The vulnerability affects X servers from version 1.4 onwards.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by David Airlie and Peter Hutterer of Red Hat.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "low" severity because of the multiple requirements for exploitation.
*   Patches have been provided to address the vulnerability.
