Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2013-1297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles script access to data. Specifically, it incorrectly allows VBScript to read JSON data files from a domain different from where the VBScript was loaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability where an attacker can gain unauthorized access to and read the contents of JSON data files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read the contents of JSON data files, potentially exposing sensitive data. The scope of impact is limited to information disclosure within the context of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers would have to convince users to visit the malicious websites through tactics like phishing emails, instant messages, or malicious banner ads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content into a website.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious website using social engineering tactics.
- No authentication is needed, but the exploit is done within the context of the current user's permissions.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer, including versions 6, 7, and 8 on various Windows operating systems and server editions
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Important" on client systems and "Low" on server systems.
- The vulnerability is mitigated by Internet Explorer's Enhanced Security Configuration, which is enabled by default on server systems.
- Workarounds include setting Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block Active Scripting or to configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting.
