  "CVE-2013-1684": {
    "description": "The provided documents describe a heap-use-after-free vulnerability in `mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::LookupMediaElementURITable`. This flaw was discovered using the Address Sanitizer tool.  Specifically a use-after-free was identified, which could lead to remote code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is a use-after-free condition within the `HTMLMediaElement::LookupMediaElementURITable` function, triggered when a media element is removed from the DOM tree but the code still tries to access memory that has been freed. This happens because a range used to track the source element pointer for a media element gravitates outside of the element when the media element is removed from the DOM.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the affected application. This is a critical security issue.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web pages",
       "Specially crafted messages with scripting enabled"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to entice a user to load a malicious webpage or open a specially crafted message (email, RSS feed, etc.) where scripting is enabled in the browser/application"
