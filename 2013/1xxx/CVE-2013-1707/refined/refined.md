Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Mozilla Updater executable (`updater.exe`).
- The updater executable improperly handles long callback paths when the `/replace` flag is used.
- The maintenance service passes command-line arguments to the updater, which leads to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** A stack buffer overflow occurs because the updater doesn't properly validate the length of the callback path. Specifically, the `updater.cpp` file at line 2940 is referenced as the vulnerable location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The buffer overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  The updater process runs with SYSTEM privileges, due to being started by the Mozilla Maintenance Service. Therefore, successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Crashing the Application:** Even without achieving arbitrary code execution, the overflow can crash the updater application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Command-Line Arguments:** The attack vector involves crafting specific command-line arguments passed to the Mozilla Maintenance Service. The service, in turn, passes these arguments to `updater.exe`.
- **Specific Flag:** The `/replace` flag needs to be used in combination with an overly long callback path to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute programs on the target system.
- **Ability to Start the Service:**  The attacker needs to be able to interact with or trigger the Mozilla Maintenance Service (e.g., by calling `ServiceController.Start` as shown in the proof-of-concept).
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:**  The attacker would need to know about the specific command-line arguments that trigger the overflow.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
