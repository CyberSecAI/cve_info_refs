| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |

For more information on how to secure the communications between Cisco Unified CVP devices, refer to the "Unified CVP security" section of the *Configuration and Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal* at the following location:      <http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/customer_voice_portal/cvp9_0/configuration/guide/cvp-configuration-and-administration-guide.pdf> A workaround is available for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal   Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability documented in Cisco Bug ID   [CSCub38384](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38384) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).         To implement the   workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability, the Manager and Host-Manager web applications must be removed manually from the Tomcat instances on CVP servers. Follow the instructions to remove the Manager and Host-Managerweb applications:    Stop the services of respective server:  The “manager” and “host-manager” web applications need to be manually removed from Tomcat instances of your CVP servers.  CVP VXML Server   Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.      CVP Call   Server   Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.      CVP Operation   Console Server   Go to the   C:\Cisco\CVP\OPSConsoleServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete   the Manager and Host-Manager folders.      CVP Reporting Server   Go   to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete   the Manager and Host-Manager folders. A workaround is available for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance documented in Cisco Bug ID   [CSCub38379](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38379) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).      To implement the   workaround for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance, follow these steps:    Stop the service of VXML Server:      Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\conf folder and edit server.xml file.      Modify autoDeploy to false. Earlier it was true.            Start the Service VXML server. None of the other vulnerabilities published in this document have workarounds.      Additional workaround details are available in the companion Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) at the following location:      <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28982>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
