Subject: CVE request: sudo authentication bypass when clock is reset

Sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p7 are now available which include a fix
for the following bug:

Sudo authentication bypass when clock is reset

Summary:
    When a user successfully authenticates with sudo, a time stamp
    file is updated to allow that user to continue running sudo
    without requiring a password for a preset time period (five
    minutes by default).  The user's time stamp file can be reset
    using "sudo -k" or removed altogether via "sudo -K".

    A user who has sudo access and is able to control the local
    clock (common in desktop environments) can run a command via
    sudo without authenticating as long as they have previously
    authenticated themselves at least once by running "sudo -k" and
    then setting the clock to the epoch (1970-01-01 01:00:00).

    The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other
    than those allowed by the sudoers policy.

Sudo versions affected:
    Sudo 1.6.0 through 1.7.10p7 and sudo 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p7.

Details:
    By default, sudo displays a lecture when the user's time stamp
    file is not present.  In sudo 1.6, the -k option was changed
    to reset the time stamp file to the epoch rather than remove
    it to prevent the lecture from being displayed the next time
    sudo was run.  No special case was added for handling a time
    stamp file set to the epoch since the clock should never
    legitimately be set to that value.

    However, there are two common ways for the clock to be reset
    to the epoch.  The first way is when the clock is reset due to
    a fully drained battery on some systems.  The other way is by
    a user logged in to a desktop environment that allows changes
    to the date and time.

    As long as the user has successfully run sudo before, they are
    able to run "sudo -k" to reset the time stamp file.  This action
    does not require a password and is not logged.  If the user is
    also able to reset the date and time to the epoch (1970-01-01
    01:00:00), they will be able to run sudo without having to
    authenticate.

Impact:
    The flaw may allow someone with physical access to a machine
    that is not password-protected to run sudo commands without
    knowing the logged in user's password.  On systems where sudo
    is the principal way of running commands as root, such as on
    Ubuntu and Mac OS X, there is a greater chance that the logged
    in user has run sudo before and thus that an attack would
    succeed.

Fix:
    The bug is fixed in sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p7.  These versions
    will ignore a time stamp file that is set to the epoch.

Workaround:
    Using "sudo -K" instead of "sudo -k" will completely remove the
    time stamp file instead of just resetting it.

Credit:
    I'd like to thank Marco Schoepl for finding and reporting this
    long-standing bug.

Package        : sudo
Vulnerability  : several issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1775 CVE-2013-1776
Debian Bug     : 701838 701839

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in sudo, a program designed
to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges to users. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-1775

    Marco Schoepl discovered an authentication bypass when the clock is
    set to the UNIX epoch [00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970].

CVE-2013-1776

    Ryan Castellucci and James Ogden discovered aspects of an issue that
    would allow session id hijacking from another authorized tty.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.4p4-2.squeeze.4.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, these problems
have been fixed in version 1.8.5p2-1+nmu1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.

## Synopsis

Low: sudo security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1701)

## Topic

An updated sudo package that fixes two security issues, several bugs, and
adds two enhancements is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
certain users the ability to run commands as root.

A flaw was found in the way sudo handled time stamp files. An attacker able
to run code as a local user and with the ability to control the system
clock could possibly gain additional privileges by running commands that
the victim user was allowed to run via sudo, without knowing the victim's
password. (CVE-2013-1775)

It was found that sudo did not properly validate the controlling terminal
device when the tty\_tickets option was enabled in the /etc/sudoers file.
An attacker able to run code as a local user could possibly gain additional
privileges by running commands that the victim user was allowed to run via
sudo, without knowing the victim's password. (CVE-2013-2776, CVE-2013-2777)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, sudo did not support netgroup filtering for sources from the

System Security Services Daemon (SSSD). Consequently, SSSD rules were
applied to all users even when they did not belong to the specified
netgroup. With this update, netgroup filtering for SSSD sources has been
implemented. As a result, rules with a netgroup specification are applied
only to users that are part of the netgroup. (BZ#880150)

* When the sudo utility set up the environment in which it ran a command,

it reset the value of the RLIMIT\_NPROC resource limit to the parent's value
of this limit if both the soft (current) and hard (maximum) values of
RLIMIT\_NPROC were not limited. An upstream patch has been provided to
address this bug and RLIMIT\_NPROC can now be set to "unlimited".
(BZ#947276)

* Due to the refactoring of the sudo code by upstream, the SUDO\_USER

variable that stores the name of the user running the sudo command was not
logged to the /var/log/secure file as before. Consequently, user name
"root" was always recorded instead of the real user name. With this update,
the previous behavior of sudo has been restored. As a result, the expected
user name is now written to /var/log/secure. (BZ#973228)

* Due to an error in a loop condition in sudo's rule listing code, a buffer

overflow could have occurred in certain cases. This condition has been
fixed and the buffer overflow no longer occurs. (BZ#994626)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

* With this update, sudo has been modified to send debug messages about

netgroup matching to the debug log. These messages should provide better
understanding of how sudo matches netgroup database records with values
from the running system and what the values are exactly. (BZ#848111)

* With this update, sudo has been modified to accept the ipa\_hostname value

from the /etc/sssd/sssd.conf configuration file when matching netgroups.
(BZ#853542)

All sudo users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues and add
these enhancements.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=916365#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-27 22:44:01 UTC  ``` From the upstream advisory:  When a user successfully authenticates with sudo, a time stamp file is updated to allow that user to continue running sudo without requiring a password for a preset time period (five minutes by default). This time stamp file can either be common to all of a user's terminals, or it can be specific to the particular terminal the user authenticated themselves on. The terminal-specific time stamp file behavior can be controlled using the "tty_tickets" option in the sudoers file. This option has been enabled by default since sudo 1.7.4. Prior to sudo 1.7.4, the default was to use a single time stamp for all the user's sessions.  A vulnerability exists because the user can control which terminal the standard input, output and error file descriptors (0-2) refer to. A malicious user could use this to run commands via sudo without authenticating, so long as there exists a terminal the user has access to where a sudo command was successfully run by that same user within the password timeout period (usually five minutes).  The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other than those allowed by the sudoers policy.  This affects versions 1.3.5 through up to the fixed 1.7.10p6 version, and sudo 1.8.0 through to the fixed 1.8.7p7.

To address the bypass, sudo was modified to extract tty information from /proc.  The fix was implemented in sudo versions 1.8.5 and 1.7.10.  However, the fix could still allow fall back to use stdin/stdout/stderr check in certain cases.  Another way to bypass that check was discovered later and what [CVE-2013-2777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-2777) ([bug 949753](show_bug.cgi?id=949753 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-2777 sudo: bypass of tty_tickets constraints")) was assigned to.  This issue was already fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 packages when they were rebased form 1.7.4p5 to 1.8.6p3 in RHBA-2013:0363 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=916363#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-27 22:36:45 UTC  ``` From the upstream advisory:  When a user successfully authenticates with sudo, a time stamp file is updated to allow that user to continue running sudo without requiring a password for a preset time period (five minutes by default). The user's time stamp file can be reset using "sudo -k" or removed altogether via "sudo -K". A user who has sudo access and is able to control the local clock (common in desktop environments) can run a command via sudo without authenticating as long as they have previously authenticated themselves at least once by running "sudo -k" and then setting the clock to the epoch (1970-01-01 01:00:00).  The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other than those allowed by the sudoers policy.  This affects versions 1.6.0 through up to the fixed 1.7.10p7 version, and sudo 1.8.0 through to the fixed 1.8.7p7.  The fix for 1.7.x: <http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/ddf399e3e306>  The fix for 1.8.x: <http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/ebd6cc75020f>   External References:  <http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/epoch_ticket.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=916363#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-27 22:47:43 UTC  ``` Created sudo tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 916367](show_bug.cgi?id=916367 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1775 CVE-2013-1776 sudo various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=916363#c5)  Fedora Update System    2013-03-16 01:22:20 UTC  ``` sudo-1.8.6p7-1.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1353)

## Topic

An updated sudo package that fixes multiple security issues and several
bugs is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
certain users the ability to run commands as root.

A flaw was found in the way sudo handled time stamp files. An attacker able
to run code as a local user and with the ability to control the system
clock could possibly gain additional privileges by running commands that
the victim user was allowed to run via sudo, without knowing the victim's
password. (CVE-2013-1775)

It was found that sudo did not properly validate the controlling terminal
device when the tty\_tickets option was enabled in the /etc/sudoers file. An
attacker able to run code as a local user could possibly gain additional
privileges by running commands that the victim user was allowed to run via
sudo, without knowing the victim's password. (CVE-2013-1776, CVE-2013-2776)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Due to a bug in the cycle detection algorithm of the visudo utility,

visudo incorrectly evaluated certain alias definitions in the /etc/sudoers
file as cycles. Consequently, a warning message about undefined aliases
appeared. This bug has been fixed, /etc/sudoers is now parsed correctly by
visudo and the warning message no longer appears. (BZ#849679)

* Previously, the 'sudo -l' command did not parse the /etc/sudoers file

correctly if it contained an Active Directory (AD) group. The file was
parsed only up to the first AD group information and then the parsing
failed with the following message:

sudo: unable to cache group ADDOM\admingroup, already exists

With this update, the underlying code has been modified and 'sudo -l' now
parses /etc/sudoers containing AD groups correctly. (BZ#855836)

* Previously, the sudo utility did not escape the backslash characters

contained in user names properly. Consequently, if a system used sudo
integrated with LDAP or Active Directory (AD) as the primary authentication
mechanism, users were not able to authenticate on that system. With this
update, sudo has been modified to process LDAP and AD names correctly and
the authentication process now works as expected. (BZ#869287)

* Prior to this update, the 'visudo -s (strict)' command incorrectly parsed

certain alias definitions. Consequently, an error message was issued. The
bug has been fixed, and parsing errors no longer occur when using 'visudo

* s'. (BZ#905624)

All sudo users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

# Authentication bypass when clock is reset

Feb 27, 2013

When a user successfully authenticates with sudo, a time stamp file
is updated to allow that user to continue running sudo without
requiring a password for a preset time period (five minutes by
default).
The user’s time stamp file can be reset using `sudo -k` or removed
altogether via `sudo -K`.

A user who has sudo access and is able to control the local clock
(common in desktop environments) can run a command via sudo without
authenticating as long as they have previously authenticated
themselves at least once by running `sudo -k` and then setting
the clock to the epoch (1970-01-01 01:00:00).

The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other than
those allowed by the sudoers policy.

## Sudo versions affected:

Sudo 1.6.0 through 1.7.10p6 and sudo 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p6 inclusive.

## CVE ID:

This vulnerability has been assigned
[CVE-2013-1775](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1775)
in the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) database.

## Details:

By default, sudo displays a lecture when the user’s time stamp file
is not present. In sudo 1.6, the -k option was changed to reset
the time stamp file to the epoch rather than remove it to prevent
the lecture from being displayed the next time sudo was run.
No special case was added for handling a time stamp file set to the
epoch since the clock should never legitimately be set to that value.

However, there are two common ways for the clock to be reset to the
epoch. The first way is when the clock is reset due to a fully
drained battery on some systems. The other way is by a user logged
in to a desktop environment that allows changes to the date and time.

As long as the user has successfully run sudo before, they are able
to run “sudo -k” to reset the time stamp file. This action does
not require a password and is not logged. If the user is also able
to reset the date and time to the epoch (1970-01-01 01:00:00), they
will be able to run sudo without having to authenticate.

## Impact:

The flaw may allow someone with physical access to a machine that
is not password-protected to run sudo commands without knowing the
logged in user’s password. On systems where sudo is the principal
way of running commands as root, such as on Ubuntu and Mac OS X,
there is a greater chance that the logged in user has run sudo
before and thus that an attack would succeed.

## Fix:

The bug is fixed in sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p7. These versions
will ignore a time stamp file that is set to the epoch.

## Workaround:

Using `sudo -K` instead of `sudo -k` will completely remove the
time stamp file instead of just resetting it.

## Credit:

I’d like to thank Marco Schoepl for finding and reporting this
long-standing bug.
