Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-1659:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the handling of the Network File Copy (NFC) protocol within VMware vCenter Server, ESXi, and ESX.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Memory corruption due to improper handling of the NFC protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker must intercept and modify NFC traffic between vCenter Server and the client, or between ESXi/ESX and the client. This implies a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be positioned within the network to intercept and modify NFC traffic.
*   The attacker needs the capability to modify the intercepted NFC traffic to trigger the memory corruption vulnerability.
