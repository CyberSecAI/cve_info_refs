##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware vCenter, ESXi and ESX NFC protocol memory corruption vulnerability

VMware vCenter Server, ESXi and ESX contain a vulnerability in the handling of the Network File Copy (NFC) protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must intercept and modify the NFC traffic between vCenter Server and the client or ESXi/ESX and the client. Exploitation of the issue may lead to code execution.

To reduce the likelihood of exploitation, vSphere components should be deployed on an isolated management network

VMware would like to thank Alex Chapman of Context Information Security for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2013-1659 to this issue.

Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.
