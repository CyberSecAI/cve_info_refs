{
  "CVE-2013-1776": {
    "Description": "sudo 1.3.5 through 1.7.10 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.5, when the tty_tickets option is enabled, does not properly validate the controlling terminal device, which allows local users with sudo permissions to hijack the authorization of another terminal via vectors related to connecting to the standard input, output, and error file descriptors of another terminal.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists because the user can control which terminal the standard input, output and error file descriptors (0-2) refer to. When sudo tries to determine the terminal device via the `ttyname()` function, it will get the name of the other terminal instead.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper validation of the controlling terminal device",
       "Bypass of tty_tickets constraints"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user could use this to run commands via sudo without authenticating, so long as there exists a terminal the user has access to where a sudo command was successfully run by that same user within the password timeout period (usually five minutes). The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other than those allowed by the sudoers policy.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Connecting to standard input, output, and error file descriptors of another terminal.",
       "Creating a new session without a controlling tty before executing sudo"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with sudo permissions, ability to control terminal file descriptors."
