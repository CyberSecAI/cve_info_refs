Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a use-after-free flaw in the Linux kernel's `tmpfs` filesystem. It occurs during a `tmpfs` remount operation when the `mpol` mount option is used during the initial mount, but is missing during the remount. Specifically, if a `tmpfs` is initially mounted with `mpol=M`, and then remounted without that option, a dangling pointer to the `mpol` object is created, leading to a use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The kernel attempts to access a memory region that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (system crash): The use-after-free can cause a system crash, as described in the provided crash logs.
- Potential privilege escalation: A privileged local user exploiting this vulnerability could potentially escalate their privileges, although this is not guaranteed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker must have local access to the system.
- Mount capability: The attacker needs to be able to mount and remount `tmpfs` file systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Privileged local user: The attacker requires privileges to mount a filesystem. On vulnerable systems, mounting and unmounting a `tmpfs` filesystem is enough to trigger the vulnerability.
- Knowledge to exploit the specific remount condition: An attacker needs to mount tmpfs with the `mpol=M` option and then remount without this option, which is likely not a common practice unless deliberately crafted for exploitation.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when the `shmem_parse_options()` function does not allocate a new `mpol` object during a remount, and the existing `mpol` object is released, but still referenced causing a dangling pointer.
- The issue affects kernel versions as old as 2.6.36.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a local, unprivileged user with unshare capabilities as of commit `5eaf563e53294d6696e651466697eb9d491f3946`.
- The fix involves refraining from releasing the mempolicy if shmem_parse_options does not create a new one.

**Summary:**
A local user able to remount tmpfs filesystems in a specific way could exploit a use-after-free vulnerability by crafting mount commands that leverage the missing mempolicy check leading to a system crash or possible privilege escalation.
