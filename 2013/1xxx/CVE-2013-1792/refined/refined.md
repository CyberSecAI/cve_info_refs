  "cveId": "CVE-2013-1792",
  "description": "A race condition in install_user_keyrings(), leading to a NULL pointer dereference, was found in the key management facility. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "A race condition occurs in the `install_user_keyrings` function when invoked concurrently for the same user, particularly when the uid and uid-session keyrings are not yet created. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing the system.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Parallel invocation of `install_user_keyrings` and `lookup_user_key` routines"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": [
      "Local access",
      "Ability to call `keyctl` system call in parallel."
