  "CVE-2013-1688": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Cve ID": "CVE-2013-1688",
      "Description": "The profiler user interface in Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. When a user examines profiler output on a malicious website containing specially crafted code, it is possible for arbitrary code execution to occur. This is because the profiler user interface runs in a special iframe that parses data from the profiler to render the UI, leaving it susceptible to manipulation."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The `escapeHTML` function in the profiler's UI used `innerHTML` to sanitize strings, which could be bypassed by injecting HTML to close the inner text node and manipulate the DOM.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
         "Use of innerHTML for escaping user-provided strings",
         "Lack of sufficient validation of profiler data"
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.",
      "Attack vectors": "By tricking a user into examining profiler output on a malicious website containing specially crafted code.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
          "Ability to create a malicious website",
            "Ability to convince a user to examine the profiler output on the crafted website"
        ]
    }
  }
