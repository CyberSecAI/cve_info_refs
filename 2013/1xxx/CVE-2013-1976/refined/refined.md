{
  "CVE-2013-1976": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way the tomcat5 and tomcat6 init scripts handled the tomcat5-initd.log and tomcat6-initd.log log files. A malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to change the ownership of an arbitrary system file to that of the tomcat user, allowing them to escalate their privileges to root.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of log files by tomcat init scripts allowed for a symbolic link attack.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Symbolic Link Vulnerability",
       "Insecure File Handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "Privilege escalation to root and denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "A malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could exploit this vulnerability."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A malicious web application deployed on Tomcat is required to perform this attack. Local access to the tomcat chroot."
