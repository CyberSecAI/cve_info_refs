Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-1911

**Root Cause:** The `ldoce` Ruby gem version 0.0.2 is vulnerable to a remote command injection vulnerability. The gem constructs shell commands using user-provided data (specifically, an MP3 URL) without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Command Injection:** The code directly interpolates the `mp3_url` into a shell command executed via backticks (` `` `). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the executed string by crafting a malicious URL containing shell metacharacters.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code doesn't validate or sanitize the `mp3_url` before using it in a shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the Ruby application that uses this gem. This could lead to:
    *   Data breaches
    *   System compromise
    *   Malware installation
    *   Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to control the `mp3_url` that is passed to the ldoce gem, which would typically involve manipulating data in an application utilizing the gem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `mp3_url` parameter. This could be achieved through various means, depending on how the application using the gem handles user input. This would involve targeting the application that uses the vulnerable gem, not the gem directly.
