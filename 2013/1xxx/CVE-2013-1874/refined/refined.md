- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Chicken Scheme interpreter loads a file named ".csirc" from the current directory on startup without verifying its trustworthiness.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Untrusted code execution via startup file inclusion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to potentially gain control of the system running the Chicken Scheme interpreter.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can create a malicious ".csirc" file in a directory where the Chicken Scheme interpreter is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs write access to the directory where the victim executes the Chicken Scheme interpreter to place the malicious ".csirc" file.
