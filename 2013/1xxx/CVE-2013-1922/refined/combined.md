Subject: CVE-2013-1922 -- qemu: qemu-nbd block format auto-detection
 vulnerability

A security flaw was found in the way qemu-nbd, the QEMU Disk Network
Block Device server tool of QEMU, performed detection of image formats
(the image format has been previously autodetected). A guest operating
system administrator could write a header to particular raw disk image
format, describing another format than original one for that disk image,
leading to scenario in which after restart of that guest, QEMU would
detect new format of the image, and could allow the guest to read any
file on the host if QEMU was sufficiently privileged.

This issue was found by Daniel Berrange of Red Hat.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 48 (CVE-2013-1922) - qemu-nbd
 format-guessing due to missing format specification

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-1922 / XSA-48
			      version 2

         qemu-nbd format-guessing due to missing format specification

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The qemu-nbd tool (shipped in the Xen hypervisor tools distribution as
qemu-nbd-xen) autodetects the image format.

If a particular disk image is intended to be raw, a guest operating
system administrator could write a header to the image, describing
another format than original one.  This could lead to a scenario in
which after restart of that guest, qemu-nbd would detect the new
apparent format of the image, including a specified backing file or
device, which could allow the guest to read any file on the host.

IMPACT
======

qemu-nbd (qemu-nbd-xen) is not used by the toolstack software supplied
with the Xen tree.  However, it is built and installed, and so might
be used by host administrators or by toolstacks other than libxl or
xend.

If qemu-nbd is used, a malicious guest administrator may be able to
read any file on the host, depending exactly how.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

For Xen systems using libxl (xl) or xend (xm): if neither qemu-nbd-xen
nor qemu-nbd (since qemu-nbd-xen is installed under the latter name in
/usr/lib/xen/bin) is explicitly invoked by scripts or other software
not supplied by the Xen project, the system is not vulnerable.

Xen systems using other toolstacks may be vulnerable if those
toolstacks use qemu-nbd[-xen].

A guest administrator who runs qemu-nbd-xen by hand on a guest may be
exposing themselves to this vulnerability.

Only qemu-xen-upstream is vulnerable; qemu-xen-traditional has a fix
which makes this bug not apply.  However, the Xen build system builds
and installs both by default, in some arbitrary order, to the same
filename.  So which is installed and might be used is not predictable
unless the qemu-xen-upstream build is entirely disabled.

Only systems with Xen 4.2 and later installed are vulnerable (by
virtue of the presence of Xen) as earlier versions of Xen do not build
qemu-xen-upstream at all.

MITIGATION
==========

No mitigation is available for users of qemu-nbd[-xen].  If you are
using qemu-nbd[-xen] from qemu-xen-upstream on raw image files, then
arranging to use qemu-xen-traditional instead will fail.

If you wish enhanced assurance, removing all copies of of qemu-nbd and
qemu-nbd-xen will provide confidence that this vulnerable utility is
not being used.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, it is necessary to apply the attached patch
(to the qemu-xen-upstream tree).

It is ALSO NECESSARY to ensure that all invocations of qemu-nbd are
provided with an appropriate -f (--format) option.  Invoking qemu-nbd
without this option remains unsafe and the patch does not prevent it.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201309-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, allowing attackers
on a Xen Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, cause Denial of
Service, or gain access to data on the host.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r3** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```
