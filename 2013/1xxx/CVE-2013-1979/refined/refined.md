Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1979:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2013-1979. The core issue is described in several sources, including:

*   The kernel.org commit message for the fix.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry.
*   The openSUSE security update announcements.
*   Andy Lutomirski's email on oss-security.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a change in the `scm_set_cred` function (in `include/net/scm.h`) which was introduced in commit 257b535. This commit incorrectly started using the *effective* UID/GID instead of the *real* UID/GID when passing credentials through Unix domain sockets.
*   This means that if a setuid process was sending credentials over a unix socket, the receiver would get the effective uid/gid of the sender which could be different from the real uid/gid when the program is executed as setuid.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Credentials Passing:** The primary vulnerability is the incorrect use of effective UID/GID instead of real UID/GID in `scm_set_cred`.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This issue can be exploited by a local unprivileged user to potentially gain elevated privileges (specifically, the privileges of a setuid binary).

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The impact is a local privilege escalation where a user could gain unauthorized privileges. This is possible when interacting with setuid binaries.
*   **Incorrect Authorization:** The receiving side of the unix socket would use the effective user id instead of the real user id, which will lead to incorrect authorization.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack vector is local.
*   **Unix Domain Sockets:** The vulnerability occurs specifically when sending credentials through Unix domain sockets using `SCM_CREDENTIALS`.
*   **Setuid Binaries:** The vulnerability is exposed when interacting with setuid binaries.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** An attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
*   **Ability to Send Unix Socket Messages:** The attacker needs the ability to send messages with credentials over a Unix domain socket.
*   **Interaction with Vulnerable Setuid Binary:** Exploitation would likely involve sending messages to a specific setuid binary that uses SCM\_CREDENTIALS.

**7. Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Regression:** Andy Lutomirski's email indicates the issue is a regression introduced in 2.6.36 and backported to older stable series (2.6.35.11).
*   **Proof-of-Concept:** Andy's email also includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the issue, which can be used to confirm the vulnerability and see how the effective id's are used instead of the real user id.
*   **Fix:** The fix is provided as commit `83f1b4ba917db5dc5a061a44b3403ddb6e783494` which reverts the credentials passing behaviour to use the real user id.
*   **Wide Impact:** The openSUSE update indicates that the vulnerability affects multiple kernel versions across different distributions and platforms.
*   **Affected Products:** As seen in SUSE security announcement, it affects products like SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3, High Availability Extension, and Desktop 11 SP3.
*   **Red Hat Status:** The Red Hat Bugzilla indicates that the issue was not present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, but was addressed in MRG 2.

In summary, CVE-2013-1979 is a privilege escalation vulnerability caused by incorrect credential handling in the Linux kernel when using Unix domain sockets, affecting multiple kernel versions.
