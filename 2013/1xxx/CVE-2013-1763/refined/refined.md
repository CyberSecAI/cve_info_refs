{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's netlink implementation for socket diagnostics lacks proper bounds checking when processing a SOCK_DIAG_BY_FAMILY request. Specifically, it does not validate if the requested family is within the bounds of the `sock_diag_handlers` array.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read/write",
       "Missing bounds check"
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds memory access, which can lead to a system crash or, more critically, to arbitrary code execution within the kernel context, resulting in privilege escalation.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted netlink message with a family value that exceeds the valid range for the `sock_diag_handlers` array."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to send netlink messages. This usually means they must have local access to the system. No special privileges are required beyond being able to create a socket."
  },
  "technical_details": {
    "array_vulnerable": "sock_diag_handlers",
      "triggering_condition": "Sending a netlink message requesting SOCK_DIAG_BY_FAMILY with `sdiag_family` value greater than or equal to `AF_MAX`",
      "affected_versions": "Linux kernel versions 3.3 to 3.8",
    "fix": "The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the `sdiag_family` value is less than `AF_MAX` before accessing the `sock_diag_handlers` array.",
	  "exploit_technique": "The provided exploits demonstrate how to trigger the out-of-bounds access to overwrite kernel memory and gain root privileges, by overwriting the return address of kernel functions with address of shellcode which will call `commit_creds` and `prepare_kernel_cred`."
