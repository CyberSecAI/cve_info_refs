Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `includeParams` attribute of the `s:url` and `s:a` tags in Apache Struts 2 handles request parameters. Specifically, when `includeParams` is set to `all` or `get`, it includes request parameters in the URL. A specially crafted request parameter can inject arbitrary OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) code, leading to remote command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OGNL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary OGNL expressions through request parameters.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `URL` and `Anchor` tags do not properly sanitize or escape request parameters when `includeParams` is set to `all` or `get`, leading to OGNL code evaluation.
- **Double Evaluation:** The injected OGNL code is evaluated twice, first when the parameter is added to the stack, and again when the `URL`/`A` tag processes the request parameters

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting malicious OGNL expressions.
- **Bypassing Protections:** The vulnerability bypasses Struts and OGNL library protections, allowing for unauthorized method execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests containing specially crafted parameters.
- **URL/Anchor Tags:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application uses `s:url` or `s:a` tags with `includeParams` set to `all` or `get`, processing parameters from the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Struts 2 application.
- The attacker needs to know a URL which contains either a `<s:url>` or `<s:a>` tag, with `includeParams` set to either `all` or `get`.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft an OGNL expression to execute malicious commands.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Struts versions 2.0.0 through 2.3.14.1.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Struts 2.3.14.2
- The fix includes a change in the `OGNLUtil` class to deny eval expressions by default
- A constant `struts.ognl.enableOGNLEvalExpression` can be set to `true` to revert to the old behavior (use with caution).
- Red Hat has stated that while Struts 2 is not actively used in Red Hat products, source code packages have included struts2-core jars, which could pose a risk to customers building artifacts from the source code. Affected Red Hat products include Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 and Single Sign On 7.3.0+.
