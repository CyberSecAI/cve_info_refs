{
  "vulnerability": {
    "overview": "The vulnerability arises from an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-0240, where credentials could be sent over the wire before notifying the user of an invalid SSL certificate. This particularly affects providers like ownCloud and Exchange which use libsoup to communicate with HTTPS servers.",
    "root_cause": "The initial fix for CVE-2013-0240 was not comprehensive, failing to prevent the transmission of credentials when encountering invalid SSL certificates. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the application attempts authentication before validating SSL certificates.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete SSL certificate validation",
      "Premature credential transmission",
      "Lack of user notification before sending credentials",
      "Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack could intercept user credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts on affected services. This is because the application sends the credentials even if it's an invalid certificate.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack",
      "Network interception of HTTPS traffic"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept network traffic between the client and server",
      "Ability to impersonate a legitimate server using a fake SSL certificate"
    ],
    "patches": [
      "Patches were developed for the master, gnome-3-8 and gnome-3-6 branches to address this vulnerability.",
      "The fix involves preventing the sending of credentials before user has been notified of the invalid SSL certificate."
     ],
    "additional_notes": "The initial vulnerability (CVE-2013-0240) was that GNOME Online Accounts did not perform SSL certificate validation when creating accounts (Windows Live and Facebook accounts) creating man-in-the-middle attack opportunities. This was fixed by setting 'ssl-strict' on the SoupSession object being used by GoaWebView for certain providers. The incomplete fix (CVE-2013-1799) was found when providers like ownCloud and Exchange would send credentials without notifying users of an invalid certificate. This was addressed by ensuring the certificate is checked before sending credentials."
