  "CVE-2013-1927": {
    "description": "The IcedTea-Web plug-in did not properly check the format of the downloaded Java Archive (JAR) files. This could cause the plug-in to execute code hidden in a file in a different format, possibly allowing attackers to execute code in the context of web sites that allow uploads of specific file types, known as a GIFAR attack.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper verification of JAR file formats by the IcedTea-Web plugin. It does not properly check if the downloaded file is indeed a valid JAR, which allows it to be exploited by files that are valid in a different format but also interpreted as JAR.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Improper file format handling"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of a web site that permits specific file uploads, if they can trick the user into visiting a malicious website that uploads a malicious file that is then interpreted as JAR.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious websites",
         "Websites that allow users to upload files, where the uploaded files are then processed by IcedTea-Web plugin. Specifically, this is a GIFAR attack"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting a malicious website or uploading a malicious file that will be processed by the plugin. The attack can be done remotely.",
     "additional_notes": "This is also known as a GIFAR attack, which combines a GIF image with a Java JAR file in a single file, which is valid as both a GIF and a JAR file."
