{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking in the `drawLineLoop` function of the ANGLE library, which is used by Mozilla products for graphics rendering. The `count` variable, controlled by JavaScript, is not properly validated before being used in integer multiplication, resulting in an integer overflow that leads to a heap overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap overflow",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to a crash of the application, and potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by web content that manipulates the `count` variable in the `drawLineLoop` function. This can be achieved by crafting a malicious webpage or HTML email (although email exploitation is less likely due to disabled scripting in Thunderbird).",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious webpage or HTML email that exploits the vulnerability. The user must have scripting enabled in their browser or mail client for the exploit to work."
