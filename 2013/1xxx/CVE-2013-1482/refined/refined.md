Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1482:

**CVE-2013-1482 is related to multiple vulnerabilities within the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).** This is evident from the HP Security Bulletin which lists CVE-2013-1482 alongside numerous other CVEs related to JRE vulnerabilities and the CERT vulnerability note which also lists CVE-2013-1482.

**Root Cause:** Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities exist within the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that can be exploited. This includes weaknesses in how the JRE handles untrusted input and manages security permissions. The specific flaws related to CVE-2013-1482 are not detailed within the provided text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The JRE has vulnerabilities that allow an untrusted Java applet to escalate privileges, bypassing the intended security manager restrictions.
*   Memory corruption vulnerabilities are present, potentially affecting both applets and standalone Java applications processing untrusted data.
*  General vulnerabilities in the JRE that can be used to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system by exploiting the JRE vulnerabilities.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Untrusted Java applets can gain elevated privileges, potentially leading to full system control.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Browsers:** Attackers can deliver malicious Java applets via compromised or specially crafted websites.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can trick users into visiting malicious sites hosting Java applets or executing malicious JNLP files.
*   **Drive-by Downloads:** Attackers can compromise legitimate websites and use them to host malicious applets that download when a user visits the page.
*   **Untrusted Data Processing:** Vulnerabilities can be triggered in standalone Java applications through processing untrusted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely, without needing prior authentication.
*   **Ability to Host/Deliver Malicious Java Applets:** Attackers need to host malicious Java applets, either on their own infrastructure or by compromising legitimate websites.
*   **Ability to Socially Engineer Users:** Attackers must convince users to interact with the malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities are present in multiple versions of the JRE, including Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier versions.
*   The vulnerabilities are actively being exploited in the wild.
*   The provided documents emphasize the importance of patching JRE installations and suggest disabling Java in web browsers as a mitigation strategy.
* The provided information suggests a CVSS score of 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) for this vulnerability, meaning high impact and low exploit complexity
