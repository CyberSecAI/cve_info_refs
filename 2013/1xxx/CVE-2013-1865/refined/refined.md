Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1865:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how OpenStack Keystone handles PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) tokens when online validation is enabled.  Specifically, the online validation process bypassed the revocation check. When online validation is used, instead of checking locally, the server validates the token and does not perform the revocation check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Bypassed Revocation Check:** The core issue is that when Keystone is configured to validate PKI tokens online, it skips the revocation check. This allows users with revoked tokens to potentially retain access to resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers with revoked PKI tokens could potentially continue to access resources they should no longer have access to. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Online Validation:**  The attack vector is specific to setups using online verification of PKI tokens, where the user/service asks the server to validate the token. 
*   **Configuration Requirement:** The system needs to be setup to use PKI tokens and also use online validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Revoked Token:** The attacker must possess a PKI token that has been revoked by the system.
*  **Online Validation Enabled:** The system must have online verification enabled for PKI tokens.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Guang Yee (HP) and was specific to the Folsom release of OpenStack.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the revocation check is performed correctly during online validation.
*   The issue was addressed by a patch that forces online validation to query the backend for token information and that ensures validation occurs correctly.
*   The issue was also related to an incorrect use of "assert" statements in code. The asserts were replaced with proper conditional checks to ensure that relevant errors are raised instead of simply allowing operations to continue with the potential for undesirable consequences.
*   The vulnerability exists because when using online validation, a code path is executed that bypasses the checks that the offline validation code path performs.
