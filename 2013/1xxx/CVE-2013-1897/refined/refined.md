{
  "Root cause": "The 389 Directory Server did not properly restrict access to entries when the 'nsslapd-allow-anonymous-access' configuration setting is set to 'rootdse'.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper access control",
    "Information exposure"
  ],
  "Impact": "An anonymous user could connect to the LDAP database and, if the search scope is set to BASE, obtain access to information outside of the rootDSE. The information provided would be the same as if 'nsslapd-allow-anonymous-access' were set to 'on'.",
  "Attack vector": "Anonymous connection to the LDAP database with a BASE search scope.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to establish an anonymous connection to the LDAP server."
