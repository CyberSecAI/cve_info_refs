Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-1418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A null pointer dereference in the `setup_server_realm()` function within the Key Distribution Center (KDC) of MIT Kerberos 5.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The `setup_server_realm()` function fails to handle cases where the server principal's realm is not found in the KDC's realm list when multiple realms are served. This leads to a null pointer dereference when trying to access realm data for an unknown realm.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to the KDC process crashing due to a null pointer dereference, preventing it from servicing authentication requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Crafted requests sent to the KDC targeting a realm not configured within the KDC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability can be triggered before authentication is processed.
- The attacker must be able to send network requests to the KDC.
- The targeted KDC needs to be configured to serve multiple realms for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in MIT Kerberos 5 versions prior to 1.10.7, and is fixed in version 1.10.7 and later releases (including 1.11.4).
- The vulnerability can be triggered when a KDC serves multiple realms, specifically if a request targets a principal with a realm that the KDC does not recognize
- A related, but less impactful vulnerability exists in third-party KDC database modules, but this requires authentication to trigger.
- Patches were created for multiple distributions (e.g., Red Hat, Debian, openSUSE, Mageia) to address this issue.
- The vulnerability is present in the `main.c` file in the KDC source code.
