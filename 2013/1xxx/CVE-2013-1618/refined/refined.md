Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Opera handled TLS CBC padding. Specifically, the implementation was vulnerable to timing attacks due to incorrect handling of padding bytes during decryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **TLS CBC Padding Oracle:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to a timing-based attack. By observing the time it takes to decrypt a TLS record, an attacker can infer information about the correctness of the padding. This is a classic padding oracle vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information within the encrypted TLS traffic. This would allow an attacker to decrypt data they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept or inject TLS traffic between the client and server using Opera. By manipulating encrypted messages sent to an Opera client and observing response times, an attacker could deduce information about the plaintext, ultimately leading to decryption of the message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and manipulate encrypted TLS communication between the Opera browser and a server.
- **Network Monitoring:** The attacker must be able to observe the timing of the responses from the Opera client.
- **Traffic Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to modify the encrypted TLS messages sent to the Opera client.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Opera Version Affected:** Opera versions prior to 12.13 were vulnerable. The vulnerability was fixed in Opera 12.13 released on January 30, 2013.
- **Mitigation:** The fix involves correcting the handling of CBC padding during TLS decryption.
- **Related CVEs:** This vulnerability is related to a broader family of attacks described in the paper <http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf> and also has similarities with other padding oracle issues, such as those found in other TLS implementations.
- **OpenSUSE Update:** The openSUSE update (openSUSE-SU-2013:0289-1) addresses CVE-2013-1618 by updating Opera to version 12.14.
