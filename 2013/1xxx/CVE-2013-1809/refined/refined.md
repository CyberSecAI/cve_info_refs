{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from Gambas creating temporary directories in an insecure manner. Specifically, it creates directories under /tmp with the name 'gambas.<UID>' where UID is the user ID of the process. It does not check if the directory already exists or what the permissions of the directory are, creating an insecure temporary directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary directory creation",
      "Lack of permissions checks",
      "Unvalidated directory existence"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can move or manipulate directory contents or perform symlink attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to run code that uses Gambas or control the creation of directories within the system"
