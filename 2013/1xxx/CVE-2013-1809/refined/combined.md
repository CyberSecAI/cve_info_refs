### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=917751#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-04 17:22:46 UTC  ``` A flaw was reported [1] in gambas where it created temporary directories insecurely, by creating /tmp/gambas.UID where UID is the user ID of the person running gambas.  It does not check if this directory already exists or what the permissions on the directory are.  This could allow a malicious user to remove, move, or manipulate the contents of the directory.  This has been fixed upstream in r5464 [2] and r5438 [3].  The upstream report only refers to Gambas 3.x, and the code is quite different in Gambas 1.x (and presumably 2.x, didn't check), but Gambas 1.x does suffer from the same problem.   [1] <https://code.google.com/p/gambas/issues/detail?id=365> [2] <http://sourceforge.net/p/gambas/code/5464/> [3] <http://sourceforge.net/p/gambas/code/5438/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=917751#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-04 17:24:16 UTC  ``` Created gambas tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 917755](show_bug.cgi?id=917755 "CLOSED CANTFIX - CVE-2013-1809 gambas3: insecure temporary directories flaw [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=917751#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-04 17:24:19 UTC  ``` Created gambas2 tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 917754](show_bug.cgi?id=917754 "CLOSED CANTFIX - CVE-2013-1809 gambas3: insecure temporary directories flaw [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=917751#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-04 17:24:21 UTC  ``` Created gambas3 tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 917753](show_bug.cgi?id=917753 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-1809 gambas3: insecure temporary directories flaw [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=917751#c4)  Tom "spot" Callaway    2013-03-06 19:57:57 UTC  ``` gambas3 is fixed as of 3.4.0, gambas1 and 2 are unmaintained upstream, so i retired those packages.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=917751#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 23:26:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=917751#c4)) > gambas3 is fixed as of 3.4.0, gambas1 and 2 are unmaintained upstream, so i > retired those packages.  Thanks, Tom.  Does that mean they will be removed from Fedora?  Or just perpetually left as-is?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=917751#c6)  Tom "spot" Callaway    2013-03-07 01:28:47 UTC  ``` We cannot remove packages from released branches, so they'll just be left to rot forever. No one is using these ancient things anyway, they were never installed in any default spins (or in anything as far as I know). If you want to take a crack at patching any vulnerabilities in them, I'll do rebuilds, but I'm not motivated at all to try (okay, so I looked at gambas2, but I can't even find any similar code paths).   ``` |  |

Hi,

the following vulnerability was published for gambas3.

[CVE-2013-1809](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1809)[0]:
Gambas creates hijackable directory in /tmp

It was found that Gambas is vulnerable to a (temorary files) directory
hijack vulnerability. Here two references:

 <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Feb/116> (fulldisclosure)
 <http://code.google.com/p/gambas/issues/detail?id=365> (upstream
 bugtracker)

Upstream also mentioned the following in their changelog for 3.4.0
release:

* BUG: Ensure that the interpreter temporary directory is owned by the
  current user and that its rights are accurate. Otherwise abort.
* BUG: When creating the process temporary directory, check the permissions
  of both the top directory (gambas.) and the process directory
  inside.

 <http://gambasdoc.org/help/doc/release/3.4.0?view>

Upstream fixes done via #5438 and #5464:

 <http://sourceforge.net/p/gambas/code/5438/>
 <http://sourceforge.net/p/gambas/code/5464/>

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.

    <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1809>

Could you possibly also bring the following to upstream's attention,
which is from the CVE request[1].
