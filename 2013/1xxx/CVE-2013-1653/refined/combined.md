                 CVE-2013-1655 CVE-2013-2274 CVE-2013-2275
Debian Bug     :

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Puppet, a centralized
configuration management system.

CVE-2013-1640

    An authenticated malicious client may request its catalog from the puppet
    master, and cause the puppet master to execute arbitrary code. The puppet
    master must be made to invoke the `template` or `inline_template` functions
    during catalog compilation.

CVE-2013-1652

    An authenticated malicious client may retrieve catalogs from the puppet
    master that it is not authorized to access. Given a valid certificate and
    private key, it is possible to construct an HTTP GET request that will
    return a catalog for an arbitrary client.

CVE-2013-1653

    An authenticated malicious client may execute arbitrary code on Puppet
    agents that accept kick connections. Puppet agents are not vulnerable in
    their default configuration. However, if the Puppet agent is configured to
    listen for incoming connections, e.g. listen = true, and the agent's
    auth.conf allows access to the `run` REST endpoint, then an authenticated
    client can construct an HTTP PUT request to execute arbitrary code on the
    agent. This issue is made worse by the fact that puppet agents typically
    run as root.

CVE-2013-1654

    A bug in Puppet allows SSL connections to be downgraded to SSLv2, which is
    known to contain design flaw weaknesses This affects SSL connections
    between puppet agents and master, as well as connections that puppet agents
    make to third party servers that accept SSLv2 connections. Note that SSLv2
    is disabled since OpenSSL 1.0.

CVE-2013-1655

    An unauthenticated malicious client may send requests to the puppet master,
    and have the master load code in an unsafe manner. It only affects users
    whose puppet masters are running ruby 1.9.3 and above.

CVE-2013-2274

    An authenticated malicious client may execute arbitrary code on the
    puppet master in its default configuration. Given a valid certificate and
    private key, a client can construct an HTTP PUT request that is authorized
    to save the client's own report, but the request will actually cause the
    puppet master to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2013-2275

    The default auth.conf allows an authenticated node to submit a report for
    any other node, which is a problem for compliance. It has been made more
    restrictive by default so that a node is only allowed to save its own
    report.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze7.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.18-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.18-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.

## Details

It was discovered that Puppet agents incorrectly handled certain kick

connections in a non-default configuration. An attacker on an authenticated

client could use this issue to possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2013-1653](/security/CVE-2013-1653))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled certain catalog requests.

An attacker on an authenticated client could use this issue to possibly

execute arbitrary code on the master. ([CVE-2013-1640](/security/CVE-2013-1640))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled certain client requests.

An attacker on an authenticated client could use this issue to possibly

perform unauthorized actions. ([CVE-2013-1652](/security/CVE-2013-1652))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled certain SSL connections.

An attacker could use this issue to possibly downgrade connections to

SSLv2. ([CVE-2013-1654](/security/CVE-2013-1654))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled serialized attributes.

An attacker on an authenticated client could use this issue to possibly

cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary. ([CVE-2013-1655](/security/CVE-2013-1655))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled submitted reports.

An attacker on an authenticated node could use this issue to possibly

submit a report for any other node. ([CVE-2013-2275](/security/CVE-2013-2275))
