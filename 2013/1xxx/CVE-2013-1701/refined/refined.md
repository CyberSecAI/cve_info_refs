Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2013-1701 is an incomplete fix for a previous bug ([bug 814407](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814407)). The initial fix for a use-after-free vulnerability related to texture attachments to Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs) in WebGL did not properly bind the correct FBO before attaching the texture. This oversight allowed for an exploitable use-after-free condition. Additionally, the issue was compounded by a failure to ensure that the WebGL context was indeed the current one before operations that relied on that binding.

A secondary issue revealed that WebGL array buffers allocated via `BufferData` with a null data pointer were not being cleared, resulting in the potential for information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free in the WebGL implementation when handling texture rebinds after updates on Mesa drivers. The incorrect framebuffer binding allows a texture to be accessed after it has been freed.
2.  **Uninitialized Memory Exposure:** When a new WebGL array buffer was created without initial data being specified, the buffer was not cleared, potentially exposing the contents of previously used graphics memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The use-after-free vulnerability could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** Uninitialized array buffers could potentially leak sensitive information from the GPU memory, including potentially screen contents.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Web Page:** A malicious actor could host a webpage with crafted WebGL code that triggers the use-after-free or uninitialized memory exposure vulnerability.
2.  **Compromised Website:** A compromised website could inject malicious WebGL code to exploit the vulnerability on visitorsâ€™ browsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Web Server or Web Hosting:** Attackers need the ability to serve malicious HTML/JavaScript content to a target.
2.  **Basic knowledge of WebGL:** The attacker needs knowledge to write or modify WebGL code to trigger the vulnerability.
3.  **Target System with Mesa Drivers** The use-after-free specifically affects users running Mesa drivers.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found to be present in Firefox, Firefox ESR, and other Mozilla-based products.
*   The fix involves asserting that the correct framebuffer is bound before texture attachment operations and ensuring that newly allocated WebGL array buffers are cleared with `calloc` when no initial data is provided.
*   The bug report indicates the issue was considered a security risk due to the potential for arbitrary code execution, and information disclosure.

**Summary of fixes:**

1.  **Assert Current Framebuffer:** The patch introduces assertions to verify that the correct framebuffer is bound before texture attachment operations.
2.  **Bind Correct Framebuffer:** Before reattaching a texture to a FBO, the correct FBO is now bound.
3.  **Initialize Array Buffers:** When a new WebGL array buffer is allocated without initial data, `calloc` is used instead of malloc to ensure the allocated memory is zeroed.
