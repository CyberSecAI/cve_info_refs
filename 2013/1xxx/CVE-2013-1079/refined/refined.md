Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `ISProxy.dll` ActiveX control included with Novell ZENworks AdminStudio. Specifically, the `ISCreateObject()` method within this control has a directory traversal vulnerability.
*   The search path can be manipulated by using a null character, potentially leading to arbitrary DLL loading.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe ActiveX Control:** The `ISProxy.dll` ActiveX control is marked as safe for scripting and initialization via the `IObjectSafety` interface. This allows Internet Explorer to execute scripts interacting with it.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The `ISCreateObject()` method does not properly validate the path, making it vulnerable to directory traversal attacks, and null byte injection.
*   **Arbitrary DLL Loading:** Combining the `Initialize()` and `ISCreateObject()` methods allows an attacker to force the operating system to load arbitrary DLLs, bypassing security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The code will execute under the context of the process that loads the vulnerable ActiveX control (e.g., Internet Explorer).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could host a malicious web page containing specially crafted JavaScript code to exploit the vulnerability. If a user visits this page using Internet Explorer, the malicious code can interact with the vulnerable ActiveX control and trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Files:** Attackers could embed the malicious exploit within a specially crafted file, such as an HTML document, that when opened with Internet Explorer, could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious exploit to the victim. This can be achieved remotely through a web server hosting a malicious webpage, or by delivering a malicious file via email or other means.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation of this vulnerability requires the user to open a malicious web page or file through Internet Explorer.

**Additional Information:**

*   Novell has released a patch to address this issue.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability through a specific filter ID ('12489').
