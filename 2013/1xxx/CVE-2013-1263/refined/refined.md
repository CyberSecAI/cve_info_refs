Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1263:

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-1263 is one of a group of vulnerabilities related to race conditions in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) that could allow elevation of privilege. This vulnerability exists because the driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.

*   **Vulnerability:** Win32k Race Condition
*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys).
*   **Affected Component:** Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys)
*   **Impact:** Elevation of Privilege. An attacker could gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system. The attacker then runs a specially crafted application to trigger the race condition.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   Valid logon credentials
    *   Ability to log on locally
    *   Ability to execute a specially crafted application.
*   **Mitigation:** Apply the security update provided by Microsoft (KB2778344)
