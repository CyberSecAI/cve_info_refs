- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from how ZENworks launches `ZenRem32.exe` and `wm.exe` during system startup. The underlying source code that launches these executables via command line does not correctly double quote the paths, which allows for command injection.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improperly quoted file paths in command execution leading to command injection
    - Local privilege escalation vulnerability

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Local privilege escalation to SYSTEM level
    - Code execution with SYSTEM privileges

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Manipulating the path to the executable by inserting malicious code. Since the path is not properly quoted, a malicious actor can create a directory or file with a name containing a malicious command, such as: `C:\Program Files\Novell\ZENworks\RemoteManagement\RMAgent\malicious.exe arg1 && malicious.exe arg2.exe` or `C:\Program Files\Novell\ZENworks\malicious.exe arg1 && malicious.exe arg2.exe`

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the system
    - Ability to modify the file system in the path before the vulnerable application attempts to execute the target program.

- **Additional Details**:
    - The vulnerable executables are `ZenRem32.exe` (Remote Management Agent 7.0.1.1) and `wm.exe` (Workstation Manager Service 7.0.1.2).
    - The issue was addressed with a patch.
