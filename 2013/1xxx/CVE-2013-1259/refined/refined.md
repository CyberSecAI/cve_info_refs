Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1259:

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-1259 is one of 30 vulnerabilities related to race conditions within the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys). Successful exploitation could lead to an elevation of privileges. This vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-016.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) during certain operations. Specifically, a race condition occurs when accessing these objects concurrently, leading to exploitable behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core weakness is a race condition in the `win32k.sys` driver. This allows an attacker to manipulate the state of objects in memory during a specific time window, leading to unintended and exploitable behavior.
*   **Improper Memory Handling:** The driver's failure to correctly manage objects in memory is what allows the race condition to be exploitable. This includes issues such as insufficient synchronization primitives or improper checks on object states.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system. This means they can execute code with higher permissions than they initially had.
*   **Kernel Memory Read:** The attacker could potentially read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory. This allows for further attacks or the exfiltration of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires the attacker to have local access to the system. They need valid logon credentials and the ability to run a specially crafted application.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application designed to exploit the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials for a user on the target system.
*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must have the ability to log on to the system locally (interactively).
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute a malicious program of their choosing on the target system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is one of a series of similar race condition flaws in the win32k.sys driver, all fixed by the MS13-016 update.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited before the security update was released.
*   The advisory mentions that while the known attack vectors are blocked for Windows 8, Server 2012, and RT, the security update is still recommended as a defense-in-depth measure.
*   The report was made by Mateusz "j00ru" Jurczyk of Google Inc
