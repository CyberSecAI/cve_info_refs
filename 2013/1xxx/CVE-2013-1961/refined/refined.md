{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the tiff2pdf tool of the libtiff library. Specifically, when tiff2pdf processes a TIFF file with malformed image-length and resolution values, it calculates `t2p->pdf_imagelength` as `(float)(t2p->tiff_length))*PS_UNIT_SIZE/t2p->pdf_yres`, potentially resulting in an extremely large number. Subsequently, the `sprintf` function is used to write this large floating-point value into a fixed-size buffer (`buffer`), which leads to the stack buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Use of sprintf without proper bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can provide a specially crafted TIFF image file that, when processed by tiff2pdf, causes the application to crash. In environments without stack protection mechanisms like FORTIFY_SOURCE, this could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running `tiff2pdf`.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through processing a malicious TIFF file using the `tiff2pdf` utility. The attacker has to craft the TIFF file with malformed image-length and resolution values to trigger the overflow.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to the vulnerable `tiff2pdf` application for processing."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_code": "The vulnerability is located in `tiff2pdf.c` around line 4148:\n```c\n    buflen=sprintf(buffer, \"%.4f\",t2p->pdf_mediabox.y2);\n```",
     "mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by replacing `sprintf` with `snprintf` which allows for bounds checking and prevents the stack buffer overflow. Patches were created to implement this mitigation upstream.",

    "reporter": "Emmanuel Bouillon (NCI Agency) reported this issue.",
    "fixes": "Patches were developed to address this issue. Red Hat provided security errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and Fedora also released updated packages.",
        "vulnerability_location": "`tiff2pdf` utility, part of the `libtiff` library, specifically the code handling image-length and resolution values in the TIFF to PDF conversion process."
