How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-04-15 09:25:02 UTC  ``` A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF document file, when malformed image-length and resolution values are used in the TIFF file. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon (NCI Agency) for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-04-15 09:41:31 UTC  ``` Here is the affected code (in tiff2pdf.c):  4148         buflen=sprintf(buffer, "%.4f",t2p->pdf_mediabox.y2);   t2p->pdf_imagelength is calculated as  (float)(t2p->tiff_length))*PS_UNIT_SIZE/t2p->pdf_yres  This results in a very large number , sizeof the buffer = 16, and this results in a stack-based buffer overflow in the variable "buffer"  RHEl-6 and Fedora builds are compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE, which results in the crash being limited to DoS and no arbitrary code execution here.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c7)  Tom Lane    2013-04-16 18:00:40 UTC  ``` I believe the best response to this is to go on a search-and-destroy mission and change basically all uses of sprintf() to snprintf() in libtiff.  Attached are patches to do that.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c8)  Tom Lane    2013-04-16 18:01:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 736471](attachment.cgi?id=736471&action=diff "patch against 4.0 CVS head") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=736471&action=edit "patch against 4.0 CVS head") patch against 4.0 CVS head   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c9)  Tom Lane    2013-04-16 18:02:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 736472](attachment.cgi?id=736472&action=diff "patch against 3.9 branch head (will work for 3.9.7)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=736472&action=edit "patch against 3.9 branch head (will work for 3.9.7)") patch against 3.9 branch head (will work for 3.9.7)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c12)  Huzaifa S.

## Topic

Updated libtiff packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
Image File Format (TIFF) files.

A heap-based buffer overflow and a use-after-free flaw were found in the
tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially
crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-1960, CVE-2013-4232)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker
could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could
cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2013-4231, CVE-2013-4243, CVE-2013-4244)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker
could use these flaws to create a specially crafted TIFF file that would
cause tiff2pdf to crash. (CVE-2013-1961)

Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NCI Agency for reporting
CVE-2013-1960 and CVE-2013-1961. The CVE-2013-4243 issue was discovered by
Murray McAllister of the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the
CVE-2013-4244 issue was discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

All libtiff users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications linked against libtiff must be restarted for this update to
take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-04-15 09:25:02 UTC  ``` A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF document file, when malformed image-length and resolution values are used in the TIFF file. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon (NCI Agency) for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-04-15 09:41:31 UTC  ``` Here is the affected code (in tiff2pdf.c):  4148         buflen=sprintf(buffer, "%.4f",t2p->pdf_mediabox.y2);   t2p->pdf_imagelength is calculated as  (float)(t2p->tiff_length))*PS_UNIT_SIZE/t2p->pdf_yres  This results in a very large number , sizeof the buffer = 16, and this results in a stack-based buffer overflow in the variable "buffer"  RHEl-6 and Fedora builds are compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE, which results in the crash being limited to DoS and no arbitrary code execution here.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c7)  Tom Lane    2013-04-16 18:00:40 UTC  ``` I believe the best response to this is to go on a search-and-destroy mission and change basically all uses of sprintf() to snprintf() in libtiff.  Attached are patches to do that.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c8)  Tom Lane    2013-04-16 18:01:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 736471](attachment.cgi?id=736471&action=diff "patch against 4.0 CVS head") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=736471&action=edit "patch against 4.0 CVS head") patch against 4.0 CVS head   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c9)  Tom Lane    2013-04-16 18:02:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 736472](attachment.cgi?id=736472&action=diff "patch against 3.9 branch head (will work for 3.9.7)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=736472&action=edit "patch against 3.9 branch head (will work for 3.9.7)") patch against 3.9 branch head (will work for 3.9.7)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=952131#c12)  Huzaifa S.

Subject: Two libtiff (tiff2pdf flaws)
Date: Thu, 02 May 2013 09:30:26 +0530
From: Huzaifa Sidhpurwala <huzaifas () redhat com>
To: oss-security () lists openwall com

Hi all,

Two flaws were reported to us in tiff2pdf utility shipped with the
libtiff library. Details as follows:

1. CVE-2013-1961 libtiff (tiff2pdf): Stack-based buffer overflow with
malformed image-length and resolution

A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF
image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of
functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format
files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF
document file, when malformed image-length and resolution values are
used in the TIFF file. A remote attacker could provide a specially-
crafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would
lead to tiff2pdf executable crash.

Reference: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=952131>

2.  CVE-2013-1960 libtiff (tiff2pdf): Heap-based buffer overflow in
t2_process_jpeg_strip()

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF
image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of
functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format
files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF
document file, in the tp_process_jpeg_strip() function. A remote
attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that
when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash or,

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=952158#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-04-15 10:14:41 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF document file, in the tp_process_jpeg_strip() function. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the tiff2pdf binary.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon (NCI Agency) for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=952158#c3)  Tom Lane    2013-04-16 19:04:52 UTC  ``` The attached patches upgrade t2p_process_jpeg_strip's JPEG-marker-parsing logic to some minimal semblance of sanity.  It's still the case that what it's trying to do is fundamentally wrong/broken, but at least now it won't dump core on its way to producing a non-standards-compliant output file.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=952158#c4)  Tom Lane    2013-04-16 19:05:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 736500](attachment.cgi?id=736500&action=diff "patch against CVS head (works for 3.9 too)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=736500&action=edit "patch against CVS head (works for 3.9 too)") patch against CVS head (works for 3.9 too)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=952158#c5)  Tom Lane    2013-04-16 19:06:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 736501](attachment.cgi?id=736501&action=diff "patch against 3.8.2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=736501&action=edit "patch against 3.8.2") patch against 3.8.2   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=952158#c6)  Huzaifa S.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Multiple issues were discovered in the TIFF tools, a set of utilities for
TIFF image file manipulation and conversion.

CVE-2013-1960

    Emmanuel Bouillon discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the
    tp_process_jpeg_strip function in the tiff2pdf tool.  This could
    potentially lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2013-1961

    Emmanuel Bouillon discovered many stack-based buffer overflows in
    the tiff tools.  These issues could potentially lead to a crash or
    arbitrary code execution.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze9.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-6+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-6+nmu1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
