Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1584:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The DTN (Delay-Tolerant Networking) dissector in Wireshark could crash due to a malformed packet.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Crash vulnerability in the DTN dissector.
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of malformed DTN packets by the DTN dissector.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a crash of the Wireshark application.
- This could lead to a denial-of-service condition, preventing users from analyzing network traffic.

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting a malformed DTN packet onto the network wire.
- Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file (.pcap) containing the crafted DTN packets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to either inject packets into a network being captured by Wireshark, or to provide a malformed packet capture file to a Wireshark user.

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 1.8.0 to 1.8.4
- Wireshark versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.12

**Fixed Versions:**
- Wireshark 1.8.5 and later
