  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of validation of the `soap.wsdl_cache_dir` configuration directive in relation to the `open_basedir` restriction.",
      "weaknesses": "The `soap.wsdl_cache_dir` directive does not take into account PHP's `open_basedir` restrictions. This allows a bypass of intended access restrictions.",
      "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to create cached SOAP WSDL files in an arbitrary directory accessible to the PHP application, potentially leading to unauthorized file writes.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through remote clients providing untrusted SOAP object input that triggers the caching of WSDL files.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send SOAP requests to a PHP application that processes them and uses the SOAP extension. The attacker does not need to be local."
