Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1635 CVE-2013-1643
Debian Bug     : 702221

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, the web scripting
language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:

CVE-2013-1635

    If a PHP application accepted untrusted SOAP object input remotely
    from clients, an attacker could read system files readable for the
    webserver.

CVE-2013-1643

    The soap.wsdl_cache_dir function did not take PHP open_basedir
    restrictions into account. Note that Debian advises against relying
    on open_basedir restrictions for security.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze15.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# CVE-2013-1643

| **Name** | CVE-2013-1643 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The SOAP parser in PHP before 5.3.23 and 5.4.x before 5.4.13 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a SOAP WSDL file containing an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue in the soap\_xmlParseFile and soap\_xmlParseMemory functions. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-1824. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=918196#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-05 17:07:25 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way PHP performed soap.wsdl_cache_dir configuration directive validation before projecting SOAP WSDL cache content to the local filesystem. A remote attacker could use this flaw to place SOAP WSDL files at arbitrary file system locations (locations accessible with the privileges of the PHP application).

## MGASA-2013-0101

| **Date:** | April 2nd, 2013 |
| --- | --- |
| **Affected releases:** | 2 |
| **Media:** | Core |

**Description:**

Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in php:

ext/soap/soap.c in PHP before 5.3.22 and 5.4.x before 5.4.13 does not

validate the relationship between the soap.wsdl\_cache\_dir directive and

the open\_basedir directive, which allows remote attackers to bypass

intended access restrictions by triggering the creation of cached SOAP

WSDL files in an arbitrary directory (CVE-2013-1635).

The SOAP parser in PHP before 5.3.22 and 5.4.x before 5.4.13 allows remote

attackers to read arbitrary files via a SOAP WSDL file containing an XML

external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference,

related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue in the soap\_xmlParseFile and

soap\_xmlParseMemory functions (CVE-2013-1643).

Backported upstream php bug #61930: "openssl corrupts ssl key resource when

using openssl\_get\_publickey()" to php-5.3.x.

The new "Powered by Mageia logo" has been added to php, this is only a

cosmetic change.

The authentication logic and how this was handled in the APC admin script

in the php-apc-admin package was flawed. If you previousely enabled the

authentication by setting a password in the /var/www/php-apc/index.php file

the changes would be lost with a possible future update of the package. If

the authentication mechanism was not used local users could access features

they shouldn't have access to. This has been addressed by using a new

/etc/php-apc/config.php configuration file containing the the

authentication credentials and more, in a much more safe, secure and

update-friendly way.

The owner of the system (the root user or equal) has to examine the

/etc/php-apc/config.php file for the login name and password. The strong

password is automatically generated on new installs.

The php-timezonedb package has been updated to the 2013.2 version.

The updated packages have been upgraded to the 5.3.23 version which is not

vulnerable to these issues.

Additionally, some packages which requires so has been rebuilt for

php-5.3.23.

Hi,
two issues have been reported in php5. [CVE-2013-1635](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1635) doesn't classify as a security
issue per the Debian Security policy, but if the fix is non-intrusive we
could include it nonetheless:

| [Description](#c0)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-03-01 17:02:20 UTC  ``` From $URL:  Description: PHP does not validate the configration directive soap.wsdl_cache_dir before writing SOAP wsdl cache files to the filesystem. Thus an attacker is able to write remote wsdl files to arbitrary locations (CVE-2013-1635).  PHP allows the use of external entities while parsing SOAP wsdl files which allows an attacker to read arbitrary files. If a web application unserializes user-supplied data and tries to execute any method of it, an attacker can send serialized SoapClient object initialized in non-wsdl mode which will make PHP to parse automatically remote XML-document specified in the location option parameter (CVE-2013-1643).   PHP version 5.3.22 and 5.4.12, which fixes these vulnerabilities were published on 21.02.2013. They are not yet available within Gentoo.  Reproducible: Always ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sean Amoss (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-03-04 02:03:27 UTC  ``` Thanks for the report, Thomas. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Ole Markus With (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-03-04 11:52:36 UTC  ``` Versions now available in the tree.(In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=459904#c0)) > From $URL: >  > PHP version 5.3.22 and 5.4.12, which fixes these vulnerabilities were > published on 21.02.2013.

These issues will be fixed in 5.4.13 and 5.4.23, which are both currently in RC1, and is expected soon. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-03-04 12:31:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=459904#c2)) > 5.3.22 and 5.4.12 is still affected.

Sure?  <http://marc.info/?l=php-cvs&m=136135762417447&w=2>  And have a look at the sourcecode: <https://github.com/php/php-src/tree/PHP-5.3.22/ext/soap>  The fix was introduced with commit <https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/8710d330dadf614d9ebb7e5d4dc62b4ce9c9eeda> (just a cherry pick - there are more related commits).  Comparing with the current current 5.3.23 tree, they didn't change anything (at least in ext/soap). Well, they fixed another (unrelated) TSRM bug.  But I must admit , that it is not really clear. They posted to the mailing list, that everyone should test 5.3.23RC because of the near release because of the mentioned CVE fixes. The prepared NEWS for 5.3.23 does also contain a notice about the CVEs (the NEWS for 5.3.22 doesn't).  ...but because it is a minor, I agree with you, that we can wait for 5.3.23 and 5.4.13, which should get released this week. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Ole Markus With (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-03-04 14:17:15 UTC  ``` 8e76d040(In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=459904#c3)) > (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=459904#c2)) > > 5.3.22 and 5.4.12 is still affected.

SUSE Security Update: Security update for PHP5
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2013:1315-1
Rating: important
References: #775852 #778003 #783239 #807707 #828020 #829207
Cross-References: CVE-2013-4113
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 for VMware LTSS
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 LTSS
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has 5 fixes is
now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The following security issues have been fixed in PHP5:
\*
CVE-2013-4635: Integer overflow in the SdnToJewish
function in jewish.c in the Calendar component in PHP
allowed context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service (application hang) via a large argument to the
jdtojewish function.
\*
CVE-2013-1635: ext/soap/soap.c in PHP did not
validate the relationship between the soap.wsdl\_cache\_dir
directive and the open\_basedir directive, which allowed
remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by
triggering the creation of cached SOAP WSDL files in an
arbitrary directory.
\*
CVE-2013-1643: The SOAP parser in PHP allowed remote
attackers to read arbitrary files via a SOAP WSDL file
containing an XML external entity declaration in
conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML
External Entity (XXE) issue in the soap\_xmlParseFile and
soap\_xmlParseMemory functions.
\*
CVE-2013-4113: ext/xml/xml.c in PHP before 5.3.27
does not properly consider parsing depth, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory
corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
crafted document that is processed by the
xml\_parse\_into\_struct function.
\*
CVE-2011-1398 / CVE-2012-4388: The sapi\_header\_op
function in main/SAPI.c in PHP did not check for %0D
sequences (aka carriage return characters), which allowed
remote attackers to bypass an HTTP response-splitting
protection mechanism via a crafted URL, related to improper
interaction between the PHP header function and certain
browsers, as demonstrated by Internet Explorer and Google
Chrome.
A hardening measure has been implemented without CVE:
\* use FilesMatch with 'SetHandler' rather than
'AddHandler' [bnc#775852]
\* fixed php bug #43200 (Interface implementation /
inheritence not possible in abstract classes) [bnc#783239]
Security Issue reference:
\* CVE-2013-4113
