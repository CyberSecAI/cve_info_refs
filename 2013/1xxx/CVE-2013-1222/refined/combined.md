Workarounds  * A workaround is available for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCub38366](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38366) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).      To implement the   workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability, the communication   between the Cisco Unified CVP devices must be secured using SSL. For more information on how to secure the communications between Cisco Unified CVP devices, refer to the "Unified CVP security" section of the *Configuration and Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal* at the following location:      <http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/customer_voice_portal/cvp9_0/configuration/guide/cvp-configuration-and-administration-guide.pdf> A workaround is available for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal   Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability documented in Cisco Bug ID   [CSCub38384](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38384) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).         To implement the   workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability, the Manager and Host-Manager web applications must be removed manually from the Tomcat instances on CVP servers. Follow the instructions to remove the Manager and Host-Managerweb applications:    Stop the services of respective server:  The “manager” and “host-manager” web applications need to be manually removed from Tomcat instances of your CVP servers.  CVP VXML Server   Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.      CVP Call   Server   Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.      CVP Operation   Console Server   Go to the   C:\Cisco\CVP\OPSConsoleServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete   the Manager and Host-Manager folders.      CVP Reporting Server   Go   to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete   the Manager and Host-Manager folders. A workaround is available for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance documented in Cisco Bug ID   [CSCub38379](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38379) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).      To implement the   workaround for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance, follow these steps:    Stop the service of VXML Server:      Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\conf folder and edit server.xml file.      Modify autoDeploy to false. Earlier it was true.            Start the Service VXML server. None of the other vulnerabilities published in this document have workarounds.      Additional workaround details are available in the companion Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) at the following location:      <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28982>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
