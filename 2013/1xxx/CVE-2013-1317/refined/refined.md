Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-1317:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow condition. Specifically, when Microsoft Publisher attempts to determine the size for a memory allocation, it results in an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow vulnerability, where the calculated size of memory required for allocation exceeds the maximum value an integer data type can store.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the integer overflow vulnerability can lead to remote code execution.
*   **Complete System Control:** An attacker could potentially take complete control of an affected system.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **User Privilege Escalation:** An attacker gains the same user rights as the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Publisher File:** The attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Microsoft Publisher file.
*   **Email Attack:** An attacker could send the malicious file as an email attachment, enticing the user to open it.
*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a malicious Publisher file on a website and convince users to visit the website and open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Craft a Malicious Publisher File:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Microsoft Publisher file that triggers the integer overflow condition.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file, either through email or by visiting a malicious website.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability affects Microsoft Publisher 2003.
* Microsoft Publisher 2007 and 2010 are not vulnerable to CVE-2013-1317 but are vulnerable to similar issues fixed by the same patch (i.e. CVE-2013-1328)
