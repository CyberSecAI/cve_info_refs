# About

This is the personal site of Andrew Brooks, and that’s me.  I’m an application security guy living in Chicago.  My personal and professional interests include application security, reverse engineering, and exploiting all kinds of software.  If you wanted to categorize me as a builder or a breaker, I guess I’d be a breaker.  I don’t write a lot of code, but I do enjoy criticizing it.

Anyone who wishes to contact me directly can do so by e-mailing andrew (dot) brooks (dot) blog [at] gmail (dot) com

And of course, all opinions expressed here are solely my own, and do not reflect the views of my employer.

# Verax NMS (1/3) – CVE-2013-1351

[March 3, 2013](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/verax-nms-13-cve-2013-1351/ "2:46 am") ·
by [andrewbrooksblog](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/author/andrewbrooksblog/ "View all posts by andrewbrooksblog") ·
in [Technical](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/category/technical/). ·

I’ve recently been curious about the general security of monitoring software, so I decided to perform some independent analysis.  After looking at a comparison chart of multiple monitoring solutions, I threw a dart and landed on Verax NMS.  According to the [vendor’s website, “](http://www.veraxsystems.com/en/products/nms)Verax NMS provides a **service-oriented, unified management & monitoring of networks, applications and infrastructure** enabling quick problem detection, root-cause analysis, reporting and automating recovery, **reducing costs and shortening downtimes of IT service delivery**.”

The first leg of the assessment resulted in 5 CVEs being issued for Verax NMS, some of which encapsulate multiple products using the Verax platform.  In this series, we will be addressing:

* CVE-2013-1351 – Password Replay Attack
* CVE-2013-1352 – Hardcoded Server-side Decryption Keys
* CVE-2013-1631 – Plaintext Password Leakage via HTTP Response
* CVE-2013-1350 – Authentication Bypass (Multiple Unauthenticated Methods)

Before proceeding, I would like to extend my appreciation to the Verax development team for their overall responsiveness and swift attention to these vulnerabilities.  If any vendors out there are looking for tips on how to deal with security researchers and vulnerability disclosure, I recommend contacting Verax for pointers.

**CVE-2013-1631 – Password Replay Attack**

The primary web UI for Verax NMS, relies on a Flash component named clientMain.swf and should be considered a Rich Internet Application (RIA).  In addition to the Flash interface, Verax NMS also uses AMF Remoting for client/server communications, which can be tested using a variety of tools, such as [Burp Suite](http://portswigger.net/) and [Adobe’s SWF Investigator.](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/swfinvestigator/)

As with many applications, the first thing we’ll look at is the login functionality.  By using Burp as a local proxy for intercepting, modifying, forwarding requests to the server, we can trap the below login request when we send the username “admin” and the password “pass,” to the server.

[![veraxLogin1j](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/veraxlogin1j.jpg?w=300&h=227)](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/veraxlogin1j.jpg)

At a glance, we can see that we are POST’ing to our AMF endpoint, and we’re sending two parameters of type string (arg0 and arg1) to the authenticateUser operation, which is part of the userService destination, and that’s all pretty standard.  But scrutinizing eyes may also notice something else, do you see what I see?  Remember, this is being sent to the server, from the client.  The password is encrypted/obfuscated before it’s sent to the server, and each time we do this, so long as the plaintext value is the same, the resultant ciphertext is also the same!  Based on this, we can come to two conclusions.  First, something client-side is encrypting our password with static keys before sending it to the server (this is our replay attack, CVE-2013-1351) and secondly, something server-side is decrypting our password, most likely with the same hardcoded keys (CVE-2013-1352).  Let’s investigate further!

The first thing we want to look into is the client-side encryption bug and the best starting point for that will be clientMain.swf.  In order to get the information we need from clientMain.swf, you can use your favorite flash decompiler/disassembler and in my case, I will use Sothink SWF Decompiler since it has a nice and handy search function.  Since the total size of clientMain.swf is around 3.5 megs, that turns out to be pretty big in terms of decompiled ActionScript, so we’ll expedite this by guessing that we want our search term to be “encrypt” which, after a little digging, turns up a few results, and exactly what we were looking for: an implementation of RSA which relies solely on static keys, implemented client-side.

[![veraxlogin2](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/veraxlogin2.jpg?w=300&h=46)](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/veraxlogin2.jpg)

Unfortunately my blog style crops the image a little smaller than I would like (click to enlarge), but we can now see where this behavior comes from and what function is handling client-side password encryption.

At the time of writing, this bug is now remediated and any affected user is strongly encouraged download the latest installer from Verax at their [official site](http://www.veraxsystems.com/en/products/nms).

Lastly, for those who are curious, the fix comes in the form seed-based password verification to stop possible replay attacks.  In the updated version, when you attempt to log in to the application, rather than the first POST being to userService.authenticateUser(), we now see a POST for userService.getAuthSeed() which provides a random and one-time use seed for encrypting the password.

Check back for future posts where we will address two additional password handling vulnerabilities in Verax NMS as well as an authentication bypass.

# Verax NMS (2/3) – CVE-2013-1352 + CVE-2013-1631

[March 6, 2013](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/verax-nms-23-cve-2013-1352-cve-2013-1631/ "5:38 pm") ·

in [Technical](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/category/technical/). ·

**CVE-2013-1352**

Continuing from our [last post](http://abc12null.com/2013/03/03/verax-nms-13-cve-2013-1351/), we discovered an interesting client-side bug regarding password encryption and replay attacks.  We also made the observation that if the password is encrypted client-side, then there is a good chance that decryption is being done server-side with the same hardcoded keys recovered from clientMain.swf.  In order to investigate further, we’re going to need to dig into the server-side .jar files that implement the decryption method and there’s a few ways to do this.

The first and easiest way to do this would be to find all the .jar files that are installed with Verax NMS, unpack them, decompile the class files (using JAD), and then just search through all of the decompiled source.  The second way, which is a little more difficult and less elegant (coincidentally the way I chose to do it, though I don’t remember why at the time) would be to decompile each .jar file individually and dig through them looking for your needle in a haystack.  Thankfully, I got lucky and found what I needed pretty quickly.  After some searching and sorting of the server-side components, the most relevant .jar files were prefixed with eadministratorconsole-\* such as:

* eadministratorconsole-core-1.5.2.jar
* eadministratorconsole-interface-1.5.2.jar
* eadministratorconsole-mediator-1.5.2.jar
* eadministratorconsole-model-1.5.2.jar
* eadministratorconsole-remote-1.5.2.jar

From the above .jar files, not only does eadministratorconsole-core-1.5.2.jar sound the most interesting, it’s also the largest and thankfully, it’s exactly what we were looking for.  After importing eadministratorconsole-core-1.5.2.jar into JD-GUI, we can drop down a few levels and find ourselves inside com.veraxsystems.eadministratorconsole.remote.service.impl which is where our method, decryptPassword() resides.

[![decrypt1](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/decrypt1.jpg?w=243&h=300)](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/decrypt1.jpg)

Then a little further down…

[![decrypt2](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/decrypt2.jpg?w=300&h=50)](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/decrypt2.jpg)

and we have the decryptPassword() method we’re interested in.  If we do a quick comparison of this to CVE-2013-1351, (identified in the first post) we can look at the associated image below:

[![veraxlogin2](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/veraxlogin2.jpg?w=300&h=47)](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/veraxlogin2.jpg)

And thus we find the same hardcoded string constants for the RSA implementation (CVE-2013-1352).  Since this bug has been fixed, in the most recent release, this method looks much different as we can see below (Decompiled from eadministratorconsole-core-1.5.3.jar):

[![decryptRSA](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/decryptrsa.jpg?w=300&h=47)](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/decryptrsa.jpg)

The reason for the differences is due to the fact that at the time of writing, users are now able to configure a public/private key pair during the initial installation and/or first VM image start up.  These keys will in turn be unique to that installation rather than the shared and hardcoded keys we identified previously.

**CVE-2013-1631**

CVE-2013-1631 is lumped in with this series of posts because 1) it’s affects the same product and 2) it’s password related, even if it’s not the most interesting bug in this series.

Within the Verax NMS interface, users of the application have the ability execute pre-defined actions on a given resource.  For example, someone may log in to their NMS installation, navigate to a monitored MS-SQL instance, and launch a repair on a corrupt table.  After making this request, the server response contains the connection details, including password, required to access this server.  For obvious reasons, this is not ideal in terms of security as it may leak sensitive information to unprivileged users.  An example of this can be seen below:

[![VeraxMSSQL](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/veraxmssql.png?w=300&h=92)](https://andrewbrooksblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/veraxmssql.png)

At the time of writing, this bug is now remediated and any affected user is strongly encouraged download the latest installer from Verax at their [official site](http://www.veraxsystems.com/en/products/nms).

In the next and final post, we will examine the exploitation of unauthenticated methods in Verax NMS.
