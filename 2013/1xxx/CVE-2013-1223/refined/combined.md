| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: |

For more information on how to secure the communications between Cisco Unified CVP devices, refer to the "Unified CVP security" section of the *Configuration and Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal* at the following location:      <http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/customer_voice_portal/cvp9_0/configuration/guide/cvp-configuration-and-administration-guide.pdf> A workaround is available for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal   Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability documented in Cisco Bug ID   [CSCub38384](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38384) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).         To implement the   workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability, the Manager and Host-Manager web applications must be removed manually from the Tomcat instances on CVP servers. Follow the instructions to remove the Manager and Host-Managerweb applications:    Stop the services of respective server:  The “manager” and “host-manager” web applications need to be manually removed from Tomcat instances of your CVP servers.  CVP VXML Server   Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.      CVP Call   Server   Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.      CVP Operation   Console Server   Go to the   C:\Cisco\CVP\OPSConsoleServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete   the Manager and Host-Manager folders.      CVP Reporting Server   Go   to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete   the Manager and Host-Manager folders. A workaround is available for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance documented in Cisco Bug ID   [CSCub38379](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38379) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).      To implement the   workaround for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance, follow these steps:    Stop the service of VXML Server:      Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\conf folder and edit server.xml file.      Modify autoDeploy to false. Earlier it was true.            Start the Service VXML server. None of the other vulnerabilities published in this document have workarounds.      Additional workaround details are available in the companion Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) at the following location:      <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28982>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
