{
  "Root cause": "The Debian-specific configuration file for lighttpd's FastCGI PHP support used a fixed socket name in the world-writable /tmp directory.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Fixed socket name in a world-writable directory.",
    "Vulnerable to symlink attacks and race conditions."
  ],
  "Impact": "A malicious local user can take over the PHP control socket and potentially force the webserver to use a different PHP version.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Symlink attack",
    "Race condition"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": [
    "Local user access to the same machine as the webserver."
  ]
