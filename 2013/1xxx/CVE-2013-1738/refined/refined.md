  "CVE-2013-1738": {
    "description": "GC hazard with default compartments and frame chain restoration",
    "root_cause": "Default compartments made bookkeeping tricky, as the default compartment on a context can change anytime, even when code is already running on that context. Additionally, the default compartment is tracked by a 'default compartment object', which can be transplanted, so the compartment computed from it varies over time. `saveFrameChain` saves the current compartment and `enterCompartmentDepth` of a context, pushing it onto a stack. `restoreFrameChain` pops the stack and resets the previous compartment and `enterCompartmentDepth`, but this setup complicates attempts to mark all live globals in the system. This setup can break, leading to a garbage collection hazard.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox, Thunderbird or SeaMonkey.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted web page, or email with scripting enabled (in the case of Thunderbird).",
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious web page or email. Scripting must be enabled in Thunderbird."
