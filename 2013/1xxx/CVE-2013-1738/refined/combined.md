| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=887334#c0)• 12 years ago |
|  | |

Default compartments make our book keeping tricky in a number of ways:
\* When we're in the default compartment, enterCompartmentDepth is zero but cx->compartment() is non-null.
\* The default compartment on a cx can change at any time, even when we've already got code running on that cx.
\* The default compartment is actually tracked by a "default compartment object", which is the outer window in Gecko. But this object gets transplanted, so even if it stays the same, the compartment we compute from it varies with time.
Meanwhile, saveFrameChain slurps up the current compartment and enterCompartmentDepth of a cx and pushes it onto a stack, putting the cx in whatever compartment currently holds the associated default compartment object. restoreFrameChain pops the stack and resets the previous compartment and enterCompartmentDepth.
This whole setup significantly complicates our attempt to mark all the live globals in the system. Currently, we do three things:
(A) (In the JS Engine): Mark the global associated with each frame on the stack.
(B) (In the JS Engine): Iterate over all the compartments, and mark those we've called enter() on.
(C) (In XPConnect): Iterate over all the contexts, and mark the global associated with the default compartment object.
This usually works. But it breaks in the following case:
1 - cx->enterCompartmentDepth is zero, and cx is in the default compartment. There is no code running on cx.
2 - We push cx, causing us to call saveFrameChain, stashing the tuple (0, defaultCompartmentObject->compartment()) onto the SavedFrameChain stack.
3 - We either call JS\_SetGlobalObject(cx, someOtherObject), or transplant defaultCompartmentObject to another compartment.
4 - We pop cx, causing us to call restoreFrameChain, setting cx->enterCompartmentDepth to 0, and putting cx in the old compartment, which is no longer equal to cx->defaultCompartmentObject->compartment().
After (3), nothing is keeping the saved compartment alive (See A-C above):
(A) No code was running in (1), we don't have any stack frames to trace.
(B) We never call enter() on default compartments.
(C) The compartment doesn't match that of the defaultCompartmentObject on the cx, so the XPConnect hook misses it.
We can keep the compartment alive between (3) and (4) by calling enter() on all the compartments we push onto the SavedFrameChain stack (luke suggested this on monday). But once (4) happens, we'd have to call leave(), and still be screwed.
I then thought that we could check in saveFrameChain whether we either (a) have manually entered the current compartment or (b) have a non-empty scope-chain in the current compartment. If we have neither of the above, we'd set the compartment of the SavedFrameChain to null, and compute the default compartment when it comes time to actually use it. But if (b) is the case, then we're still in trouble, because as soon as the associated code is finished running, the cx will remain in that compartment, but we'll have no way to mark it (since none of A-C will apply once the last stack frame is popped).
In general, the solution here is to rip out default compartment objects, and I have a plan to do that. But I'd like to find a well-contained fix here that we can backport. Thoughts, luke?

Nice catch with the problem of enter()/leave() on save/restore.
This defaultCompartment stuff is madness. Agreed that the long-term fix is to remove it all, but how about this as an intermediate solution: we have cx->compartment = NULL by default (until a compartment is explicitly via AutoCompartment). This means adding "AutoCompartment ac(cx, GetDefaultGlobalForContext(cx)" in the few remaining places that depend on the defaultCompartmentObject. (So JS\_SaveFrameChain would reset cx->compartment = NULL.)
This would also help out [bug 722345](/show_bug.cgi?id=722345 "RESOLVED FIXED - remove request API") which wants to remove the request API to use "cx->compartment == NULL" in place of "cx->outstandingRequests > 0". I started to do this but I didn't know enough to pick the right compartment to enter in all cases; istr you saying this would be much easier now.Flags: needinfo?(luke)

This is tantamount to "removing it all", AFAICT. We'd either need to fix a bunch of consumers to use JSAutoCompartments, or fix a bunch of places in the JS engine to handle cx->compartment being null. I have a plan for doing the former, but I don't think it's easily backportable. Do you have any ideas for a more localized fix?Flags: needinfo?(luke)

Well, except that there is still a GetDefaultGlobalForContext/JS\_SetGlobalObject available. I thought that any path into the JS engine already had to funnel through one of a few of this CxPusher paths (which is where I assumed you'd add the AutoCompartment).

The former is what I intended; you have to enter a compartment to enter the JS engine.

Nope, this is all pretty gnarly. OTOH, other than these ASan bugs, do you think this is crashing much in the wild? If not, letting the fix ride the trains seems preferable.Flags: needinfo?(luke)

As of recently yeah, but that doesn't help us on branches.

I'm concerned about letting a pretty exploitable gc hazard go unfixed for the lifetime union of all our supported branches. It was less detectable before when we were pushing/popping less. But now that it is, it seems pretty likely that somebody is going to found it. Nils found it, and a lot of those tools are open-source.
Is there a choke-point where the last frame pops off the callstack for a given cx, and would doing a little bit of work there be acceptable performance-wise? If so, we could do the following:
\* If restoreFramechain pops a SavedFrameChain with enterCompartmentDepth == 0, it throws away the stashed compartment and uses the current defaultCompartmentObject, \_unless\_ there are frames on the stack.
\* In the event of the above, we rely on code in the aforementioned choke point to reset cx->compartment based on the defaultCompartmentObject when the stack becomes empty.
I know the above is kind of gross, but the code complexity will be short-lived, since we'll follow it up with a removal of all this gunk. But if it's feasible from a performance standpoint, I think we should do it for the sake of branch security.

I didn't consider this an option because it would change observable behavior (what if someone assumed that, after the JS\_RestoreFrameChain that the compartment was as it was before JS\_SaveFrameChain? Maybe you understand more about this, but in the abstract this seems scary for a Beta branch patch.

Ok, I will give that a try.

Hm. I guess it might be an issue if someone was in the default compartment on a cx, allocated an object, then did a scoped push/pop of that cx, then used that object. That doesn't seem super likely, but it's hard to say. I'm going to give this some thought and dig into the code a bit.

Talked with luke about this. I think we have no other good option but to remove default compartment objects. We can backport that to aurora24 (and definitely should, given esr24), but probably not anything earlier. dveditz is in the loop on this too.Whiteboard: underlying cause/fix of 882897,883301 and probably 886174

As an update - I'd run into some nasty GC crashes in IPC xpcshell tests, which I fixed by spending a week gutting XPCShellTestEnvironment and friends to be much simpler and single-cx-ready ([bug 889714](/show_bug.cgi?id=889714 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clean up IPC XPCShellEnvironment.cpp")). The patches in this bug are now green. Uploading and flagging for review.

cx->global() assumes a non-null compartment(). When we fix up various bugs

[Part 4 - Move faulty JSAutoRequest in initSelfHosting. v1](attachment.cgi?id=773640&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=773640&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=887334&attachment=773640)

The call to JS\_SetGlobalObject causes cx->compartment\_ to be set to the self-
hosting global, which means that the JSAutoCompartment picks up that compartment
as the 'previous' compartment. So despite the attempt to restore things with
JS\_SetGlobalObject at the end of the function, the JSAutoCompartment destructor
actually ends up leaving cx in the self-hosting global's compartment at the end
of this function. Moving the JSAutoCompartment construction above the call to
JS\_SetGlobalObject fixes the problem.

So I don't know if it's a good idea to do this each time in the loop. Couldn't we just do it the first time and be done?
Also, nit: Use braces

This is in xpc, so your call, but I assume the "we used to" comment will become stale/irrelevant in a few months and so maybe you'd rather remove it (and but it in the cset comment for anyone that notices the change and hg annotates).

Quickstubs will be gone in a few months, so I think it should be ok.

Attached patch

[Part 7 - Use the new AutoCompartment overload for the atoms compartment and remove AutoEnterAtomsCompartment. v2](attachment.cgi?id=776726&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=776726&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=887334&attachment=776726)

We have to do some temporary hackiness to deal with some of the new PJS work.
This patch stays as true to the old world as possible, so that we can more
easily backport it.

Part 17 - Reorder some bookkeeping and assert in setCompartment that both the old and new compartments are marked as entered. v1
Flagging these patches, along with dependencies, for Firefox 24 uplift, given that this fixes a major otherwise unfixable sec-critical that fuzzers are starting to find (see dependent bug). dveditz is in the loop here, and definitely wants this on 24 (see [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=887334#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - GC hazard with default compartments and frame chain restoration")).
This request applies to the patches in this bug, as well as those in [bug 889714](/show_bug.cgi?id=889714 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clean up IPC XPCShellEnvironment.cpp") and [bug 889911](/show_bug.cgi?id=889911 "RESOLVED FIXED - Unify non-DOM JSErrorReporters"). Note that the fixes in those bugs are \_only\_ needed to fix failures in the IPC XPCshell test harness, and they largely only affect testing infrastructure.
[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): longstanding
User impact if declined: sec-critical
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Just landed on m-c
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Moderate risk, but no less-risky alternatives
String or IDL/UUID changes made by this patch: None

Part 17 - Reorder some bookkeeping and assert in setCompartment that both the old and new compartments are marked as entered. v1
Approving, given we need this on Fx24.
Given, moderate risk here if there is any QA testing/verification needed here that could mitigate that , please loop in QA here(Matt Wobensmith). And an eyeout on possible regression this may have in the next couple of days will be helpful as well, given the bake time on m-c.

My impression of the embargo is we just wouldn't open up the bug to the public until we end of life ESR17, not that we wouldn't write an advisory. Dan, what do you think?Flags: needinfo?(abillings) → needinfo?(dveditz)

If that's the case, then the embargo can't say anything much more useful than "we fixed a GC hazard".

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

# USN-1951-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

17 September 2013

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1718](/security/CVE-2013-1718), [CVE-2013-1719](/security/CVE-2013-1719))

Atte Kettunen discovered a flaw in the HTML5 Tree Builder when interacting

with template elements. In some circumstances, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1720](/security/CVE-2013-1720))

Alex Chapman discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in the ANGLE

library. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1721](/security/CVE-2013-1721))

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free in the Animation Manager. An

attacked could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1722](/security/CVE-2013-1722))

Scott Bell discovered a use-after-free when using a select element. An

attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1724](/security/CVE-2013-1724))

It was discovered that the scope of new Javascript objects could be

accessed before their compartment is initialized. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1725](/security/CVE-2013-1725))

Dan Gohman discovered that some variables and data were used in IonMonkey,

without being initialized, which could lead to information leakage.

([CVE-2013-1728](/security/CVE-2013-1728))

Sachin Shinde discovered a crash when moving some XBL-backed nodes

in to a document created by document.open(). An attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1730](/security/CVE-2013-1730))

Aki Helin discovered a buffer overflow when combining lists, floats and

multiple columns. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2013-1732](/security/CVE-2013-1732))

Two memory corruption bugs when scrolling were discovered. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1735](/security/CVE-2013-1735), [CVE-2013-1736](/security/CVE-2013-1736))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that user-defined getters on DOM proxies would

use the expando object as "this". An attacker could potentially exploit

this by tricking add-on code in to making incorrect security sensitive

decisions based on malicious values. ([CVE-2013-1737](/security/CVE-2013-1737))

A use-after-free bug was discovered in Firefox. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1738](/security/CVE-2013-1738))

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

In a debug build, I got a similar crash on shutdown, but no assertions otherwise that I noticed:
xpc\_UnmarkNonNullGrayObject(JSObject\*) + 15 (HeapAPI.h:101)
nsCxPusher::DoPush(JSContext\*) + 183 (nsCxPusher.cpp:141)

nsBindingManager::ExecuteDetachedHandlers() + 276 (nsBindingManager.cpp:1015)
nsGlobalWindow::PostHandleEvent(nsEventChainPostVisitor&) + 744 (nsGlobalWindow.cpp:3081)
The test case involves mutation observers, and is crashing in nsCxPusher.Keywords: [csec-uaf](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csec-uaf&resolution=---),

Bobby, do you think this could be related to the nsCxPusher stuff you've been working on? Both this and [bug 883301](/show_bug.cgi?id=883301 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - ASAN use-after-free in JS_GetGlobalForScopeChain #2") involve pushing a dead JSContext.

This symptom became detectable due to [bug 868130](/show_bug.cgi?id=868130 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fold JSAutoRequest into nsCxPusher"), but bholley says the underlying GC problem (which he's fixing in [bug 887334](/show_bug.cgi?id=887334 "RESOLVED FIXED - GC hazard with default compartments and frame chain restoration")) has been around for a while.Blocks: [868130](/show_bug.cgi?id=868130 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fold JSAutoRequest into nsCxPusher")

Will this be fixed when [bug 887334](/show_bug.cgi?id=887334 "RESOLVED FIXED - GC hazard with default compartments and frame chain restoration") lands (and it went to inbound yesterday)?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-92

## GC hazard with default compartments and frame chain restoration

Announced
September 17, 2013
Reporter
Nils, Bobby Holley
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 24
* SeaMonkey 2.21
* Thunderbird 24

### Description

Security researcher **Nils** reported a potentially exploitable
use-after-free in an early test version of Firefox 25. Mozilla developer
**Bobby Holley** found that the cause was an older garbage collection
bug that a more recent change made easier to trigger.

In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.

### References

* [GC hazard with default compartments and frame chain restoration](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=887334) ([CVE-2013-1738](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1738))

# USN-1952-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

18 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting

enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1718](/security/CVE-2013-1718))

Atte Kettunen discovered a flaw in the HTML5 Tree Builder when interacting

with template elements. If a user had scripting enabled, in some

circumstances an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2013-1720](/security/CVE-2013-1720))

Alex Chapman discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in the ANGLE

library. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1721](/security/CVE-2013-1721))

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free in the Animation Manager. If

a user had scripting enabled, an attacked could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1722](/security/CVE-2013-1722))

Scott Bell discovered a use-after-free when using a select element. If

a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1724](/security/CVE-2013-1724))

It was discovered that the scope of new Javascript objects could be

accessed before their compartment is initialized. If a user had scripting

enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with

the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1725](/security/CVE-2013-1725))

Dan Gohman discovered that some variables and data were used in IonMonkey,

without being initialized, which could lead to information leakage.

([CVE-2013-1728](/security/CVE-2013-1728))

Sachin Shinde discovered a crash when moving some XBL-backed nodes

in to a document created by document.open(). If a user had scripting

enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial

of service. ([CVE-2013-1730](/security/CVE-2013-1730))

Aki Helin discovered a buffer overflow when combining lists, floats and

multiple columns. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1732](/security/CVE-2013-1732))

Two memory corruption bugs when scrolling were discovered. If a user had

scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1735](/security/CVE-2013-1735),

[CVE-2013-1736](/security/CVE-2013-1736))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that user-defined getters on DOM proxies would

use the expando object as "this". If a user had scripting enabled, an

attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking add-on code in to

making incorrect security sensitive decisions based on malicious values.

([CVE-2013-1737](/security/CVE-2013-1737))

A use-after-free bug was discovered in Thunderbird. If a user had

scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2013-1738](/security/CVE-2013-1738))
