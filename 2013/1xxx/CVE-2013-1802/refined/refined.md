Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1802:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a YAML parameter parsing vulnerability present in the `extlib` Ruby gem. The vulnerability arises from the gem's improper handling of YAML data, specifically within the XML parser. The issue was related to the gem attempting to coerce string parameters into YAML or symbols.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of YAML parameters within the XML parser.
- Unsafe coercion of strings to YAML and symbols.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The SUSE security update mentions a DoS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability allows processing of untrusted data that could lead to unexpected behavior and likely remote code execution similar to the Rails vulnerability it is related to (but not explicitly stated).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted XML data containing malicious YAML parameters to an application that utilizes the vulnerable `extlib` gem for XML processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send malicious XML data to a vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be on the local network if the application is internet-accessible.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of `extlib` up to and including 0.9.15.
- The fix is included in `extlib` version 0.9.16 and later.
- The issue was discovered by researchers investigating a similar parameter parsing vulnerability in Rails.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple libraries.
- The vulnerability was addressed by removing YAML and symbol coercion from the XML parser.
