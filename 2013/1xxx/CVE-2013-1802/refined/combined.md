| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=917233#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-03-02 08:54:19 UTC  ``` Tasha Drew reports:  Researchers investigating the Rails parameter parsing vulnerability discovered  that the same or similar vulnerable code had made its way into multiple other  libraries. If your application uses these libraries to process untrusted data,  it may still be vulnerable even if you have upgraded Rails. Check your Gemfile  and Gemfile.lock for vulnerable versions of the following libraries, and if you are using one, update it immediately.  You can update each of these by using "bundle update <gem name>".   extlib  Vulnerable: <= 0.9.15  Fixed: 0.9.16  External references: <https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/entries/22915701-january-14-2013-security-vulnerabilities-httparty-extlib-crack-nori-update-these-gems-immediately>  <https://github.com/datamapper/extlib/compare/b4f98174ec35ac96f76a08d5624fad05d22879b5%E2%80%A64540e7102b803624cc2eade4bb8aaaa934fc31c5>  <https://rubygems.org/gems/extlib/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=917233#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-03-02 08:54:55 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-extlib tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-all [[bug 917234](show_bug.cgi?id=917234 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1802 Ruby Gem extlib: YAML parameter parsing vulnerability [epel-all]")]   ``` |  |
