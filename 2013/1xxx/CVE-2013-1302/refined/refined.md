Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-1302

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises when Microsoft Lync or Communicator attempts to access an object in memory that has already been deleted. This can lead to memory corruption, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory management: Specifically, the failure to handle object deletion correctly, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specially crafted content: An attacker crafts a malicious file or program, then shares it via the Lync or Communicator presentation feature.
- Social Engineering: The attacker must convince the victim to accept an invitation to view or share the malicious content. This is a crucial step, as the attack cannot be forced on the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the victim via Lync or Communicator.
- Ability to craft malicious content: The attacker must have the technical expertise to create a file or program that can exploit the memory corruption vulnerability.
- Social engineering: The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to interact with the malicious presentation content, typically by accepting an invitation to view or share the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Communicator 2007 R2, Microsoft Lync 2010, Microsoft Lync 2010 Attendee, and Microsoft Lync Server 2013 (Web Components Server).
- The Exploitability Index for this vulnerability is rated as "1 - Exploitation More Likely," indicating that Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability.
- The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability if configured to work with Lync and Communicator.
- There are no identified workarounds for this vulnerability besides applying the official patch.
