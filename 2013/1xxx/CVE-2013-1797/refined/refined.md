{
  "CVE-2013-1797": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Use-after-free error in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) when handling guest OS time updates.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A potential use-after-free condition occurs if a guest specifies a GPA (guest physical address) in movable or removable memory and the KVM module continues to write to this address even after it is removed using KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A privileged guest user could escalate privileges to the host kernel level, or cause a denial of service on the host system by causing host memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "A privileged user in a KVM guest operating system could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the GPA of the time_page.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a privileged user within a KVM guest operating system with the ability to control the GPA that is registered to be used for time updates."
