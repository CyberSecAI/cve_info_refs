Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `InstallTrigger` in Mozilla products handles URI validation. Specifically, `InstallTrigger` was using the wrong principal when validating URIs before performing security-sensitive actions. This caused the checks to be performed against the incorrect origin, thus failing to prevent malicious actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Principal for URI Validation**: The core issue was that the `InstallTrigger` was not properly identifying the source of the request. Instead of using the principal of the content that initiated the request, it was using the principal of the new window that was loading the content, leading to a bypass of security checks.
- **Same-Origin Policy Bypass**: By using the wrong principal, the vulnerability could allow for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Malicious Add-on Installation**: The incorrect principal check could allow a malicious third-party webpage to install add-ons without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into vulnerable web pages, potentially stealing user data, performing actions on the user's behalf, or redirecting to malicious sites.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to take complete control of the user's system.
- **Malicious Add-on Installation:** Attackers could potentially install malicious add-ons from third-party pages, which could lead to further exploitation of the system.
- **Bypass of Security Checks**: The vulnerability allowed bypassing of normal security mechanisms such as the same-origin policy.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could craft a malicious web page that exploits the vulnerability using JavaScript, using the incorrect principal to perform unauthorized actions.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could also inject the exploit into legitimate, but compromised websites, targeting visitors to those sites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers needed to understand how `InstallTrigger` was incorrectly validating URIs.
- **Ability to Deliver Malicious Code:** Attackers needed to be able to deliver malicious HTML and JavaScript to a victim's browser, either through direct access to a malicious site or by compromising a legitimate one.
- **Target User Action:** Generally, the user would need to visit a malicious or compromised page to initiate the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was found in several Mozilla products including Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird and Thunderbird ESR.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox 23, Firefox ESR 17.0.8, SeaMonkey 2.20, Thunderbird 17.0.8, and Thunderbird ESR 17.0.8.
- The issue could not be exploited via email in Thunderbird due to scripting being disabled.
- The security risk was considered high, prompting the prompt release of a fix.
