Subject: [notification] exactimage DoS, jumping into the unknown

Hi,

While testing the update of exactimage for the fixes in its embedded
copy of dcraw (CVE-2013-1438) I noticed that it did not initialize
(setjmp) the jump pointer used by dcraw for error handling.
In addition to the new checks introduced to fix the above-mentioned
issue, there were already some cases where longjmp was called, causing
the execution to jump to a location defined by an uninitialized
variable.

This new issue has been assigned CVE-2013-1441.

Note that this is specific to exactimage and is not a bug, per-se, in dcraw.

According to the Debian maintainer this bug has probably been present
since ExactImage 0.0.12

This has been fixed in Debian with the patch added in the following commit:
<http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/exactimage.git;a=commitdiff;h=1dff2eb586a3d10d8528a984bc471292e3789f5c;hp=acfe54193b18b46e880f4b474d2e40b4fdb44a8d>

Cheers,

Package        : exactimage
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1441

It was discovered that exactimage, a fast image processing library,
does not correctly handle error conditions of the embedded copy of
dcraw. This could result in a crash or other behaviour in an
application using the library due to an uninitialized variable being
passed to longjmp.

This is a different issue than CVE-2013-1438/DSA-2748-1.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.1-3+deb6u3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.5-5+deb7u3.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.8.9-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your exactimage packages.
