Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2013-1346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine's improper scanning of specially crafted files, which leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper scanning of specially crafted files.
- Potential for remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the LocalSystem account, granting them complete control of the system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  A specially crafted file must be scanned by a vulnerable version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. This can occur in several ways:
    - Website delivery: An attacker can host a malicious file on a website, which gets scanned when a user visits the site.
    - Email or instant messaging: A malicious file can be delivered via these channels, and scanned when the user opens the file.
    - User-provided content hosting:  An attacker could upload a malicious file to a shared location that gets scanned by the Malware Protection Engine on the hosting server.
-  Real-time protection: If real-time protection is enabled, the engine scans files automatically, potentially triggering the vulnerability upon encountering a specially crafted file.
- Scheduled Scans: If real-time scanning is not enabled, a scheduled scan could trigger the vulnerability.
- Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT): Systems scanned using an affected version of the MSRT are also vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a specially crafted file to a location that will be scanned by a vulnerable version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. 
- No specific position on the network is mentioned, as the attack can be delivered through various channels, including web, email, instant messaging, etc.

**Additional Information:**

*   Only x64-based versions of the Malware Protection Engine are affected.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed as a denial of service prior to the advisory release.
*   The affected versions of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine are prior to version 1.1.9506.0.
*   An exploitability assessment has been published by Microsoft, rating the exploitability of this vulnerability as "Exploitation less likely" (2), meaning exploit code would be difficult to build.
*  The Microsoft Malware Protection Engine is part of various Microsoft anti-malware products including Microsoft Forefront Client Security, Microsoft Forefront Endpoint Protection, Microsoft Security Essentials, Windows Defender and more.
