The Cisco Nexus 6000 Series of devices is not affected by the vulnerabilities described in this document.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * **Multiple Cisco Discovery Protocol Vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS-Based Products**      Cisco NX-OS based devices contain multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) subsystem. These vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The vulnerabilities are due to a failure to properly handle malformed Cisco Discovery Protocol packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by passing malformed Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.      Because Cisco Discovery Protocol works at the data link layer (Layer 2), an attacker must be able to submit an Ethernet frame directly to an affected device to exploit this vulnerability. This action may be possible in situations where the affected system is part of a bridged network or connected to an unpartitioned device, such as a network hub.      This vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco bug IDs, and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1178.      **Cisco Bug IDs:**   + **UCS 6100/UCS 6200** - [CSCtu10630](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtu10630) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 7000/MDS 9000** - [CSCtu10551](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtu10551) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 5000/Nexus 5500** - [CSCtu10550](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtu10550) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 4000** - [CSCtw56581](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtw56581) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 3000** - [CSCtu10548](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtu10548) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 1000v** - [CSCtu10544](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtu10544) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **CGR 1000** - [CSCuf61275](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf61275) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)**Cisco NX-OS Software SNMP and License Manager Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**   Cisco NX-OS Software-based devices contain a buffer overflow vulnerability in the SNMP subsystem. An authenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by submitting a malicious SNMP query via UDP port 161 to trigger a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP and License Manager components of the device. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.       SNMP is disabled by default and must be explicitly configured by an administrator. Because SNMP is primarily a UDP-based protocol, no TCP three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability, and the malicious request could contain a spoofed origin. The attacker must know the configured community strings for SNMP version 1 and version 2. Exploitation also requires a valid username and password when a device is configured for SNMP version 3.      This vulnerability can be triggered via SNMP over IPv4 and SNMP over IPv6.      This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCtx54830](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx54830) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1179.      **Cisco NX-OS Software SNMP Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**      Cisco NX-OS based devices contain a buffer overflow vulnerability in the SNMP subsystem. An authenticated, remote attacker who can submit a malicious SNMP query via UDP port 161 could exploit   the vulnerability to trigger a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP component of the device. Successful exploitation could   allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.       SNMP   is disabled by default, and must be explicitly configured by an   administrator. Because SNMP is primarily a UDP based protocol, no TCP   three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability, and the malicious   request could contain a spoofed origin. The attacker must know the configured community strings for SNMP version 1 and   version 2. Exploitation also requires a valid username and password when a device is   configured for SNMP version 3.      This vulnerability can be triggered via SNMP over IPv4 and SNMP over IPv6.      This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCtx54822](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx54822) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1180.      **Cisco NX-OS Software Jumbo Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco NX-OS based devices contain a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability. An unauthenticated, remote attacker who can send a jumbo frame packet to the management interface of an affected device could cause the device to crash and reload.      The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of jumbo packets. Large packets that are sent through the switching fabric of the device will not trigger the vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco bug IDs, and has been   assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1181.   **Cisco Bug IDs:**   + **UCS 6200**- [CSCtx17544](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx17544) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 5500** - [CSCts10593](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts10593) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 3000** - [CSCtx95389](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx95389) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)  Workarounds  * No on-device workarounds exist for any of the vulnerabilities detailed in this advisory.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.4 |

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.
