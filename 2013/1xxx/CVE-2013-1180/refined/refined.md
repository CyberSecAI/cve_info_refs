Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1180:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the SNMP subsystem of Cisco NX-OS based devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when handling malicious SNMP queries. This can lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious SNMP query via UDP port 161.
- It can be triggered via SNMP over IPv4 and SNMP over IPv6.
- The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious SNMP packet to the affected device

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated (know the community strings for SNMPv1/v2 or have valid credentials for SNMPv3).
- The attacker must be able to send traffic to the device via UDP port 161.
- The attacker could potentially spoof the origin of the malicious request due to the UDP nature of SNMP.

**Additional details:**
- SNMP is disabled by default on Cisco NX-OS devices and has to be explicitly enabled.
- This vulnerability affects the Cisco MDS 9000 and Nexus 7000 series devices.
- The vulnerability is tracked by Cisco bug ID CSCtx54822.
