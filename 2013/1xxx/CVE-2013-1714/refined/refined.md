Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how web workers handle cross-origin requests using XMLHttpRequest (XHR). Specifically, web workers were not properly enforcing the same-origin policy when making XHR requests to different domains.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** Web workers could bypass the same-origin policy, allowing them to make cross-origin requests without proper authorization.
- **Missing Permission Checks:** The vulnerability was due to XHR using `IsCallerChrome()` instead of `IsSystemXHR()` for security decisions. The patch changed XHR to use `IsSystemXHR()`.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to make unauthorized cross-origin requests could lead to XSS attacks by web workers.
- **Custom Header Injection:** Web workers could include custom headers in their cross-origin XHR requests. This is problematic since it can be a vector to bypass CSRF protections that rely on header validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the provided information doesn't explicitly state arbitrary code execution, it mentions that the general class of flaws may lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a common consequence of XSS attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation could enable attackers to inject malicious scripts into other websites or applications.
- **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially use the vulnerability to access or modify sensitive data from different domains or perform unauthorized actions.
- **CSRF bypass:** Custom headers in XHR requests can bypass CSRF protections on target sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Workers:** The attack vector is through the use of web workers, which were found to improperly handle cross-origin XMLHttpRequest requests.
- **XMLHttpRequest:** The vulnerability relies on the abuse of the XMLHttpRequest API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create and control web workers:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in a context where they can create and control web workers. This can include malicious websites or vulnerable web applications.
- **Target must use vulnerable browser:** The exploit requires a target to use a browser vulnerable to CVE-2013-1714.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was initially reported by Federico Lanusse.
- The bug was fixed by changing the XHR security check from `IsCallerChrome()` to `IsSystemXHR()`.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 23, Firefox ESR 17.0.8, SeaMonkey 2.20, Thunderbird 17.0.8, and Thunderbird ESR 17.0.8.
- The Debian security advisories (DSA-2735-1 for iceweasel and DSA-2746-1 for icedove) also address this issue, as those products are based on Mozilla Firefox/Thunderbird respectively.
- The provided content indicates that while the vulnerability is primarily a risk in browser contexts, it could also be a risk in "browser-like contexts."
- Although scripting is disabled by default in Thunderbird, if scripting were enabled in Thunderbird, it would be affected by this vulnerability.
- The issue was assigned a "sec-high" keyword within the Bugzilla tracker, indicating its high security risk.
- Addons could theoretically be broken by the fix.
- The original fix in ESR17 was insufficient and had to be patched further, as the original patch didn't include the check for `IsSystemXHR()`.
