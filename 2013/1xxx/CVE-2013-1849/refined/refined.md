Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `mod_dav_svn` module in Subversion improperly attempts to process PROPFIND requests made against activity URLs instead of rejecting them. This leads to an attempt to access invalid memory (NULL).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Handling:** `mod_dav_svn` doesn't correctly handle PROPFIND requests on activity URLs, which are intended for other operations.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The flawed processing leads to the server attempting to dereference a NULL pointer, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. When the `httpd` process crashes, the service becomes unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Resource Depletion (Indirect):**
    -  On `httpd` servers using prefork MPM, the server restarts a new process to replace the crashed one.
    -  On servers using threaded MPMs, other requests being processed by the same thread might be interrupted as the entire process crashes. In either case, this leads to increased processing, loss of per-process caches, and potential resource depletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Attackers send a malicious PROPFIND request to the Subversion server.
- **Specific URL Target:** The PROPFIND request must target a valid activity URL. Activity URLs are created with MKACTIVITY. However, valid activity URLs might not get cleaned up and an attacker can try to guess existing activity URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Subversion server.
- **Knowledge or Guessing Activity URLs:** 
    - The attacker either needs to have created an activity URL, or needs to know or guess the UUIDs used in the activity URLs, potentially using UUID predictability to guess. 
    -  Read access to the repository is required, because PROPFIND is needed to perform the attack
-   **No Authentication Required (Potentially):** Although creating an activity URL generally requires authentication, this vulnerability can be exploited if anonymous read access to the repository is allowed, and a valid activity URL is known.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Subversion HTTP servers up to version 1.7.8 (inclusive).
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending the following HTTP requests in sequence:
   ```
   MKACTIVITY /egg/!svn/act/foo HTTP/1.1
   PROPFIND /egg/!svn/act/foo HTTP/1.1
    ```
*   Patches are available for both 1.6.x and 1.7.x branches. The fixed versions are Subversion 1.6.21 and 1.7.9.
*   A temporary mitigation can be applied by adding the following `mod_rewrite` configuration:
```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !=DELETE
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !=MKACTIVITY
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /!svn/act/[^/]\*/\*$
RewriteRule .\* - [L,F]
```
* Several Linux distributions were affected, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, Fedora 17 and 18, and multiple openSUSE releases.
*   The issue was reported by tytusromekiatomek via the full disclosure mailing list.
