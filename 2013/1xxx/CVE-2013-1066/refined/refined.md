{
  "CVE-2013-1066": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that language-selector was using polkit in an unsafe manner. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass intended polkit authorizations.",
    "Root cause": "The language-selector was passing the process ID (PID) instead of the system bus name as the subject to PolicyKit. This could lead to a race condition during UID lookups.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of polkit",
      "Race condition vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation, bypassing polkit authorizations.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally."
