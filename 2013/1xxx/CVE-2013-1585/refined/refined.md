Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the MS-MMC dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, the issue is related to how the dissector handles the length parameter when processing Unicode strings within network packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is a crash vulnerability within the MS-MMC dissector. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the length parameter in `tvb` Unicode functions that were used by the dissector when parsing the packets.
- The issue may also be present in other dissectors as indicated by the description "and possibly others".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the Wireshark application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a malformed MS-MMC packet onto the network.
- An attacker could also exploit the vulnerability by enticing a user to open a malformed packet trace file (.pcap).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject a crafted network packet into the network being monitored by the victim running wireshark.
- Alternatively, an attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious packet capture file to a wireshark user.
- No special privileges are required on the victim machine for a successful exploit.

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 1.8.0 to 1.8.4 and 1.6.0 to 1.6.12 are affected.

**Patched versions:**
- The issue is resolved in Wireshark versions 1.8.5 and 1.6.13, and later.
