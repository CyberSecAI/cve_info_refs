Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2013-1294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel's improper handling of objects in memory. This suggests a flaw in how the kernel manages memory allocation, deallocation, or access, leading to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition within the Windows kernel. This typically means multiple threads or processes are attempting to access and modify the same memory location concurrently, resulting in unpredictable behavior.
- **Improper Memory Handling:** This is a high-level description of the bug and indicates that specific memory management routines within the kernel are vulnerable, possibly lacking proper synchronization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker could successfully gain elevated privileges. This allows the attacker to execute code with higher privileges than intended.
- **Arbitrary Kernel Memory Read:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory, potentially disclosing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and must be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. This means it's not exploitable remotely.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the race condition and exploit the memory handling vulnerability within the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker needs a valid user account to log on to the system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute programs or applications on the targeted system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was privately reported to Microsoft by Gynvael Coldwind and Mateusz "j00ru" Jurczyk of Google Inc.
- Microsoft rates the vulnerability as "Important" for all affected Windows versions.
- The vulnerability is addressed by a security update that corrects the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.

**Summary:**
CVE-2013-1294 describes a race condition vulnerability in the Windows kernel arising from improper object handling in memory. A locally logged-in attacker with the ability to run applications can leverage this to escalate their privileges and gain the ability to read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.
