Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) Player.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The WRF Player is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow, which occurs when the program writes data beyond the allocated buffer size on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crashing the application:** A successful exploit can crash the affected WRF player.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** In some scenarios, exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the targeted user's system. This means an attacker could potentially take control of the user's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WRF Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious WRF file designed to trigger the buffer overflow vulnerability when opened by the WRF player.
*   **Delivery Methods:**
    *   Direct delivery: The malicious WRF file can be sent directly to the user (e.g., via email).
    *   Malicious website:  An attacker can trick a user into visiting a malicious web page that then forces the download and execution of a malicious WRF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need any special access to the user's machine or the WebEx infrastructure. They are remote attackers.
*   **Ability to create a malicious WRF file:** The attacker must be capable of crafting a malicious WRF file.
*   **Ability to deliver file:** The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious file to a victim through some method, be it email, compromised websites, etc..
