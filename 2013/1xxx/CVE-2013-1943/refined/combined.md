This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

KVM: Validate userspace\_addr of memslot when registered

```
This way, we can avoid checking the user space address many times when
we read the guest memory.

Although we can do the same for write if we check which slots are
writable, we do not care write now: reading the guest memory happens
more often than writing.

# USN-1939-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

6 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to

run commands as root when using the perf tool.

([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

Michael S. Tsirkin discovered a flaw in how the Linux kernel's KVM

subsystem allocates memory slots for the guest's address space. A local

user could exploit this flaw to gain system privileges or obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-1943](/security/CVE-2013-1943))

A flaw was discovered in the SCTP (stream control transfer protocol)

network protocol's handling of duplicate cookies in the Linux kernel. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) on another remote user querying the SCTP connection.

([CVE-2013-2206](/security/CVE-2013-2206))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=950490#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-04-10 10:47:00 UTC  ``` A check for valid userspace memory was found missing in kvm_set_memory_region() function. Because of that, memory regions pointing to kernel memory could be registered with KVM and later used when converting guest physical addresses to host virtual ones. Several call sites relied on the validation and were using read/write functions that were missing the access_ok() check when accessing userspace memory.  A local unprivileged user on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 system could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 EUS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 EUS the impact is limited to potential information leak only.  A local user on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 system able to write to /dev/kvm could possibly use this flaw to leak kernel memory.  Upstream fixes: <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=fa3d315a4ce2c0891cdde262562e710d95fba19e> <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=9e3bb6b6f6a0c535eb053fbf0005a8e79e053374>  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=950490#c1)  Petr Matousek    2013-04-10 10:55:06 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.  Future kvm updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 may address this flaw.  This issue was addresses in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2013:0911 (<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0911.html>).  Please note that unlike Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, where a local unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 EUS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 EUS the impact is limited to potential information leak only.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=950490#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-10 21:52:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0911 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0911.html>   ``` |  |
