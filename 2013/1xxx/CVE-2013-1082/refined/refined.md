Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from missing validation checks of the language variable when accessing the `DUSAP.php` script. This lack of validation allows bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is that the lack of validation on the language variable allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism.
*   **Direct Access to Script:** The vulnerability is exploitable through directly invoking a PHP script `DUSAP.php`, indicating a lack of proper access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication.
*   The specific impact after bypassing authentication is not mentioned in this document, but it can be inferred that it can be used to gain access to sensitive data or perform privileged actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Script Invocation:** The attack vector involves directly accessing and invoking the `DUSAP.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web interface exposed by ZENworks Mobile Management
*   The attacker needs to know the location of `DUSAP.php` script.

**Affected Products:**
*   Novell ZENworks Mobile Management 2.7.0
*   Novell ZENworks Mobile Management 2.6.1
