How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ownCloud Security Advisories (2013-017, 2013-018)

---

*From*: Lukas Reschke <lukas () owncloud org>

*Date*: Sun, 21 Apr 2013 14:13:44 +0200

```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This vulnerabilities only affect ownCloud Server 5.0.x and 4.5.x, the
4.0.x branch is not affected and still supported with security updates
by us.

---------------------------------------

# XSS vulnerability in MediaElement.js (oC-SA-2013-017)
Web: <https://owncloud.org/about/security/advisories/oC-SA-2013-017/>

## CVE IDENTIFIERS
- CVE-2013-1967 (MediaElement.js)

## AFFECTED SOFTWARE
- ownCloud Server < 5.0.5
- ownCloud Server < 4.5.10

## RISK
- High

## COMMITS
- b13c31b (stable5)
- 239ec01 (stable45)

## DESCRIPTION
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in all ownCloud versions
prior to 5.0.5 and 4.5.10 except the 4.0.x branch allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary javascript when a user opens a special crafted URL.

This vulnerability exists in the bundled 3rdparty plugin
“MediaElement.js”, “MediaElement.js” released version 2.11.2 which
addresses the problem.

## CREDITS
The ownCloud Team would like to thank Malte Batram (batr.am) for
discovering this vulnerability and responsibly disclosing this to us
and upstream.

## RESOLUTION
Update to ownCloud Server 5.0.5 or 4.5.10
<http://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-5.0.5.tar.bz2>
<http://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-4.5.10.tar.bz2>

---------------------------------------

# Privilege escalation in the contacts application (oC-SA-2013-018)
Web: <https://owncloud.org/about/security/advisories/oC-SA-2013-018/>

## CVE IDENTIFIERS
- CVE-2013-1963

## AFFECTED SOFTWARE
- ownCloud Server < 5.0.5
- ownCloud Server < 4.5.10

## RISK
- High

## COMMITS
- 9cc35e4 (stable5)
- fc4632d (stable45)

## DESCRIPTION

Due to not properly checking the ownership of a single contact, an
authenticated attacker is able to download contacts of other users in
all ownCloud versions prior to 5.0.5 including the 4.5.x branch.

Note: Successful exploitation of this privilege escalation requires
the “contacts” app to be enabled (enabled by default).

## RESOLUTION
Update to ownCloud Server 5.0.5 ir 4.5.10
<http://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-5.0.5.tar.bz2>
<http://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-4.5.10.tar.bz2>

## Installation and Usage

*MediaElementPlayer: HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` player*

A complete HTML/CSS audio/video player built on top `MediaElement.js` and `jQuery`. Many great HTML5 players have a completely separate Flash UI in fallback mode, but MediaElementPlayer.js uses the same HTML/CSS for all players.

### 1. Add Script and Stylesheet

```
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="mediaelement-and-player.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mediaelementplayer.css" />

```

### 2. Option A: Single H.264 file

If your users have JavaScript and Flash, this is the easist route for all browsers and mobile devices.

```
<video src="myvideo.mp4" width="320" height="240"></video>

```

### 2. Option B: Multiple codecs with Flash fall-through when JavaScript is disabled

This includes multiple codecs for various browsers (H.264 for IE and Safari, WebM for Chrome, Firefox 4, and Opera, Ogg for Firefox 3) as well as a Flash fallback for non HTML5 browsers with JavaScript disabled.

```
<video width="320" height="240" poster="poster.jpg" controls="controls" preload="none">
	<source type="video/mp4" src="myvideo.mp4" />
	<source type="video/webm" src="myvideo.webm" />
	<source type="video/ogg" src="myvideo.ogv" />
	<object width="320" height="240" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="flashmediaelement.swf">
		<param name="movie" value="flashmediaelement.swf" />
		<param name="flashvars" value="controls=true&amp;poster=myvideo.jpg&amp;file=myvideo.mp4" />
		<img src="myvideo.jpg" width="320" height="240" title="No video playback capabilities" />
	</object>
</video>

```

### 3. Run startup script

Make sure this is not in the `<head>` tag or iOS 3 will fail.

```
<script>
// jQuery method
$('video').mediaelementplayer();
</script>

<script>
// normal JavaScript
var player = new MediaElementPlayer('#player');
</script>

```

## How it Works:

*MediaElement.js: HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` shim*

`MediaElement.js` is a set of custom Flash and Silverlight plugins that mimic the HTML5 MediaElement API for browsers that don't support HTML5 or don't support the media codecs you're using.
Instead of using Flash as a *fallback*, Flash is used to make the browser seem HTML5 compliant and enable codecs like H.264 (via Flash) and even WMV (via Silverlight) on all browsers.

```
<script src="mediaelement.js"></script>
<video src="myvideo.mp4" width="320" height="240"></video>

<script>
var v = document.getElementsByTagName("video")[0];
new MediaElement(v, {success: function(media) {
	media.play();
}});
</script>

```

You can use this as a standalone library if you wish, or just stick with the full MediaElementPlayer.
