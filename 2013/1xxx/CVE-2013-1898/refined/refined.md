Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-1898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `Thumbshooter` Ruby gem version 0.1.5 is vulnerable due to its direct use of user-supplied URLs in a shell command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application constructs a shell command by directly embedding a URL provided by the user. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the string by using shell metacharacters within the crafted URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where the `Thumbshooter` gem is running.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted URL containing shell metacharacters when generating a thumbnail.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input URLs to the `Thumbshooter` application. This is generally via the application's API/interface which uses the gem to generate thumbnails.
