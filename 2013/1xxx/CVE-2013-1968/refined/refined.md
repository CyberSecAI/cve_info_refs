{
  "CVE-2013-1968": {
    "Description": "Subversion incorrectly handled newline characters in filenames. A remote authenticated attacker could use this flaw to corrupt FSFS repositories.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The FSFS repository format in Subversion stores filename data on a line-per-line basis within revision files. A newline character (ASCII 0x0a) within a filename is incorrectly treated as a line separator, rather than as part of the filename, causing the resulting revision to be corrupt.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect handling of newline characters in filenames within the FSFS repository format."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Corruption of FSFS repositories, causing issues such as svnadmin verify failing, svnsync failing to replicate the revision, and disruption of service for other users.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote authenticated attacker with commit access to the repository.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with commit access."
  }
