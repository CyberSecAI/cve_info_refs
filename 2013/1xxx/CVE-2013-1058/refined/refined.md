  "CVE-2013-1058": {
    "description": "It was discovered that maas-import-pxe-files doesn't cryptographically verify downloaded content. An attacker could modify images without detection.",
    "root_cause": "The `maas-import-pxe-files` utility downloads files over HTTP without cryptographic verification.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of cryptographic verification of downloaded files.",
      "Use of insecure HTTP for downloading sensitive files."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to inject malicious payloads by modifying the downloaded PXE boot files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept the network traffic between the MAAS server and the server hosting the PXE boot files."
