Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1084:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `www.novell.com_73620337_20250125_182735.html` directly references CVE-2013-1084.  The other provided documents are related to Flexera and Microfocus products but don't directly provide useful information on the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue within the `umaninv` service of Novell ZENworks Configuration Management.
*   The `GetFile` method in the `umaninv` service was vulnerable.
*   By manipulating the `Filename` parameter in a URL request, an attacker could access arbitrary files on the server.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `Filename` parameter, allowing relative paths (`../`) to be used to navigate outside the intended directory.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker could potentially download any file accessible by the web server process.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  This could expose sensitive information, configuration files (e.g., `catalog.ini`), or other data.
*  **Potential for Further Attacks:** Depending on the nature of the files disclosed, the attacker may use this information to escalate the attack.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:**  An attacker could craft a malicious HTTP GET request to the `zenworks-unmaninv` endpoint.
*   **URL Parameter Tampering:** The attacker would manipulate the `Filename` parameter in the URL to include relative path traversal sequences (`../`) to access files outside the intended directory.
* **Example Request:** `<http://164.99.98.124/zenworks-unmaninv/?action=GetFile&Filename=../../catalog.ini&Type=4&Platform=11&Lang=0>`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the vulnerable ZENworks server.
*   **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** The attacker would need basic knowledge of HTTP requests and URL parameters.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided information does not state any authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was resolved in version 11.2.4 of Novell ZENworks Configuration Management. A change was made to prevent the use of relative paths in the URL to access files.
* The vulnerability was classified as a "Security Alert" by Micro Focus.
