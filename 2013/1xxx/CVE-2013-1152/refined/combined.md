Affected versions of Cisco ASA Software will vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions.      Cisco PIX Security Appliances may be affected by some of the vulnerabilities described in this security advisory. Cisco PIX has reached the End of Software Maintenance Releases milestone. Cisco PIX Security Appliance customers are encouraged to migrate to Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.   Vulnerable ProductsIKE Version 1 Denial of Service VulnerabilityA device running Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if IKE version 1 is enabled. IKE version 1 is enabled if the command **crypto isakmp enable**  (Cisco ASA Software 8.3.x and earlier) or **crypto ikev1 enable**  (Cisco ASA Software 8.4.x and later) is configured.      IKE version 1 is not enabled by default.Crafted URL Denial of Service VulnerabilityA device running Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the device is using authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users are enabled. HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users are enabled if the command **aaa authentication listener** is configured.      AAA for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users are not enabled by default.Denial of Service During Validation of Crafted Certificates To be vulnerable, Cisco ASA Software must have at least one authenticated trustpoint enrolled with a third-party certificate authority or enrolled with the Cisco ASA local certificate authority.  To determine whether Cisco ASA Software is configured with an authenticated trustpoint, use the **show crypto ca certificate** command and verify that the certificate is associated to at least one trustpoint. The following example shows a certificate associated to a trustpoint called '*test*'  ```   ciscoasa# show crypto ca certificates[...]  Status: Available  [...]  Associated Trustpoints: test   ```  Digital certificate authentication is not enabled by default. DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if DNS inspection is enabled.  To determine whether DNS inspection is enabled, use the **show service-policy | include dns** command. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with DNS inspection enabled:  ```   ciscoasa# show service-policy | include dns    Inspect: dns preset_dns_map, packet 0, lock fail 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0    ``` DNS inspection is enabled by default.Determining the Running Software Version To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **show version** command. The following example shows a device running Cisco ASA Software version 8.4(1):      ```    ciscoasa#show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) Device Manager Version 6.4(1)    ```    Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco ASA-CX Context-Aware Security is not affected by any of these vulnerabilities.      With the exception of the Cisco FWSM, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is the operating system used by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, the Cisco ASA Services Module (ASASM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, and the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall. The Cisco ASA family provides network security services such as firewall, intrusion prevention system (IPS), anti-X, and VPN.      Cisco ASA Software contains multiple vulnerabilities that may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.IKE Version 1 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThe IKE version 1 implementation contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.      The vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of an incoming IKE version 1 message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IKE message. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.      Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects routed firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCub85692](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub85692) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1149.Crafted URL Denial of Service VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the URL processing code of the authentication proxy feature of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.      The vulnerability is due to mishandling of a crafted URL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service condition. Both transit traffic and traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCud16590](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud16590) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1150.Denial of Service During Validation of Crafted CertificatesA vulnerability in the implementation of the function used to validate digital certificates for authentication could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.      This vulnerability is due to an implementation error in the code that validates the digital certificates used during authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted certificate to trigger an authentication operation on an affected device. Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuc72408](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc72408) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1151.DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Software DNS application inspection supports DNS message controls that provide protection against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning. A vulnerability in the DNS inspection engine code of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of the affected device.      This vulnerability is due to improper processing of some fields in DNS messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS message that triggers inspection by an affected device.      Only transit traffic can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuc80080](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc80080) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1152  Workarounds  * IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability Disabling IKE version 1, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. Note that disabling IKE version 1 will disable IPsec-based VPN tunnels (LAN-to-LAN and remote access) that are configured to use IKE version 1 for Security Association (SA) negotiation and establishment. However, if administrators use only SSL VPN (remote access only), it may be possible to disable IKE version 1 with no impact to the VPN solution. IKE version 1 can be disabled with the global configuration commands **no crypto isakmp enable**  (Cisco ASA Software 8.3.x and earlier) or **no crypto ikev1 enable**  (Cisco ASA Software 8.4.x and later).  IKE version 2 is not affected by this vulnerability, so migrating to IKE version 2 and disabling IKE version 1 will eliminate this vulnerability. Crafted URL Denial of Service Vulnerability Disabling AAA for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users can be disabled with the global configuration command **no aaa authentication listener**. Denial of Service During Validation of Crafted Certificates There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability Disabling DNS inspection, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the DNS inspection that is configured by default:  ```   ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policyciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_defaultciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect dns   ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |
