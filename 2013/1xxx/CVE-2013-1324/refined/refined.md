Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1324:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the way Microsoft Office components handle WordPerfect document (.wpd) files. Specifically, there's improper handling of objects in memory leading to memory corruption. This corruption allows an attacker to overwrite a stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** A stack buffer overwrite vulnerability exists in the processing of WordPerfect files. This allows an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack, potentially executing arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user does not have administrative privileges, the impact would be less, but the attacker would still be able to execute code at the user's level of access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attack:** An attacker can send a specially crafted .wpd file to a user and convince them to open it.
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a website containing the malicious .wpd file, and trick users into visiting the site and opening the document. Compromised websites that host user-provided content could also be used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafting Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted WordPerfect document file (.wpd) that triggers the stack buffer overflow.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file, either through email, social media or web-based attacks
- **No special network privileges:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to be on the local network.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 (including RT).
- The vulnerability is addressed by Microsoft security update MS13-091.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed and there were no reports of active exploitation before the security bulletin was released.
- Microsoft credited Will Dormann of the CERT/CC for reporting the vulnerability.
