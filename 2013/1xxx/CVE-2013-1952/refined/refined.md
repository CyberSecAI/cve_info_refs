Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of source validation on interrupt remapping table entries for MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts) interrupts set up by bridge devices in the Xen hypervisor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing source validation on interrupt remapping table entries for MSI interrupts configured by bridge devices. This allows for the injection of arbitrary interrupts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious guest domain can inject interrupts into the domain owning the bridge devices (typically domain 0 in Xen), causing a denial-of-service (DoS) affecting the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious guest domain with access to a bus mastering capable PCI device which is behind a bridge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a guest domain.
- The guest domain must be granted access to a bus mastering capable PCI device that is behind a bridge.
- The system must be using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Xen versions 4.0 and later.
- The issue is specific to systems using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough.
- The provided patches address this issue by implementing the missing source validation.
