Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-1321:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Publisher failing to properly validate a returned value type while parsing specially crafted Publisher files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of the returned value type within the Publisher file parsing process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
*   **Malicious Activities:**  An attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Publisher Files:** The primary attack vector involves tricking users into opening specially crafted Publisher files.
*   **Email Attachments:** Attackers can send malicious Publisher files as email attachments.
*   **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious files on compromised or attacker-controlled websites and entice users to visit them.
*   Compromised Websites: Attackers could also inject malicious Publisher files into compromised websites or websites that allow user-generated content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting Malicious Files:** The attacker needs the ability to create specially crafted Publisher files that trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file.
*   **Delivery Mechanism:** The attacker needs a method to deliver the malicious file to the target user, such as email or a website.

**Affected Software:**
* Microsoft Publisher 2003 Service Pack 3

**Mitigating Factors:**

*   Users with accounts with fewer rights are less impacted.
*   The vulnerability is not automatically exploited by email, requiring a user to open the file.

**Workarounds:**
* Avoid opening Publisher files from untrusted sources.
