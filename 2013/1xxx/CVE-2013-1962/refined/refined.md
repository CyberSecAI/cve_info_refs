  "CVE-2013-1962": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2013-1962",
      "Description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way storage pool manager of libvirt, a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes), performed management of socket file descriptors when 'to list all volumes for the particular pool' request was issued (two socket file descriptors were leaked per \"list all pool volumes\" request). An uprivileged user could use this flaw to cause denial of service (make libvirtd daemon to exhaust / reach the maximum count of open file descriptors, the libvirtd daemon process was allowed to open, possibly preventing other users from use of libvirtd services till the libvirtd daemon was restarted)."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The libvirt storage pool manager leaked file descriptors when handling requests to list all volumes for a particular pool.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "File descriptor leak"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote, unprivileged attacker could cause a denial of service by exhausting the maximum number of open file descriptors allowed for the libvirtd daemon. This would prevent other users from using libvirtd services until the daemon was restarted.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "A remote attacker able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could issue 'list all volumes' requests to trigger the file descriptor leak"
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a remote connection to the libvirtd daemon with read-only permissions to trigger the vulnerability."
    }
  }
