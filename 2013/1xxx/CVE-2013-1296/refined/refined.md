Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1296:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Remote Desktop ActiveX control (mstscax.dll) attempting to access an object in memory that has already been deleted (freed). This leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the Remote Desktop ActiveX control.
- Memory corruption due to accessing freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the system.
- The attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- An attacker could host a malicious website or compromise a legitimate site, including those hosting user-provided content/advertisements, to deliver the exploit.
- Attackers could use social engineering methods (e.g., malicious links in emails or instant messages) to trick users into visiting the compromised site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or control a website accessible by the victim.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit this specially crafted website.
- No specific user privileges are needed, as the attacker would gain privileges upon successful exploit.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Remote Desktop Connection Client versions 6.1, 7.0, and 7.1 on Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client operating systems (Windows XP, Vista, 7) and "Moderate" for server operating systems (Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2008 R2).
- The vulnerability is triggered when the Remote Desktop ActiveX control (mstscax.dll) tries to access an object in memory that has been deleted.
- The document provides several workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability, such as restricting access to mstscax.dll, disabling the Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX control in Internet Explorer, and setting higher security zone settings in Internet Explorer.
- The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help to mitigate the exploitation of this vulnerability by adding additional protection layers.
- This vulnerability was privately reported and was not known to be actively exploited when the security bulletin was initially released.
