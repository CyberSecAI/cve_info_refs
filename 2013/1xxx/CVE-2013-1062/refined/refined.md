Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an unsafe use of polkit within `ubuntu-system-service`. Specifically, the service was passing the process ID (PID) as the subject to polkit for authorization checks, instead of the system bus name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Subject Identification:** Using the PID as the subject for polkit authorization is unreliable because PIDs can be reused, potentially leading to a race condition where a malicious process could assume the identity of another authorized process. This makes it easier to bypass intended policykit authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the intended polkit authorizations and execute actions they would normally not be permitted to perform. This could lead to a local privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have a user account on the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Ubuntu system.
*   **Ability to Interact with DBus:** The attacker must be able to interact with the `ubuntu-system-service` via DBus to trigger the vulnerable code path.
*   **Timing/Race Condition:** The attacker needs to be able to exploit a race condition related to PID reuse for successful exploitation, but precise details of the race are not provided.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The fix involves modifying `UbuntuSystemService/utils.py` to pass the system bus name as the subject to PolicyKit instead of the PID. This ensures that PolicyKit can accurately retrieve the required authorization information from the system bus.

**Affected Software:**

*   `ubuntu-system-service` versions prior to 0.2.4.1 (Ubuntu 13.04), 0.2.3.1 (Ubuntu 12.10), and 0.2.2.1 (Ubuntu 12.04)

**Mitigation:**

*   Update the `ubuntu-system-service` package to the patched versions specified in the security notice.
*   Reboot the system after the update for the changes to take effect.

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-1062 describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability in `ubuntu-system-service` due to the insecure use of polkit. By passing PID instead of system-bus-name to policykit, it allowed a local attacker to bypass the intended authorizations and potentially gain elevated privileges. The vulnerability is mitigated by updating the package to the patched version and rebooting the system.
