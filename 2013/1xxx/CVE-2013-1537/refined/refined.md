  "CVE-2013-1537": {
    "description": "RMI implementation in OpenJDK uses property java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly, which controls whether automatic loading of classes from other sources than local CLASSPATH and location specified in the java.rmi.server.codebase property is permitted. This property previously defaulted to false, allowing dynamic class downloading. This could allow an attacker to make RMI server or registry to execute arbitrary untrusted code. It was demonstrated that this can be used in combination with another Java sandbox bypass flaw to execute code in the remote rmiregistry or GlassFish Server.",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the default value of the `java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly` property in the RMI implementation, which allowed dynamic class downloading. This could lead to remote code execution on RMI servers or registries.",
    "impact": "An attacker could make a vulnerable RMI server or registry execute arbitrary untrusted code. It can also be used in combination with another Java sandbox bypass flaw to execute code in the remote rmiregistry or GlassFish Server.",
     "attack_vector": "Network attack. An attacker able to connect to an application using RMI can exploit this vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the RMI server or registry. No authentication is required, and no special privileges are required on the victim's machine.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the insecure default value of the 'java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly' property in the RMI implementation which allowed automatic loading of classes from remote locations."
