Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1717:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content explicitly mentions `CVE-2013-1717` in multiple locations, including the Mozilla Security Advisory and bugzilla entries.
   - The description from the advisory matches the vulnerability described in the provided bugzilla entry for bug 406541.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability arises from the way Java applets handle the `codebase` parameter when loaded from a local `file:///` URI. 
   - Specifically, the browser's checks on the `codebase` were inadequate and could be bypassed.
   - The vulnerability was further exacerbated by an interaction between the `<object>` tag's `codebase` attribute, and the `codebase` parameter within the applet tag. This allowed a malicious applet to declare a `codebase` of `file:///` even when loaded from a different directory.
   - This bypass allowed local java applets to gain read-only access on the local file system.
   - Further research identified other inconsistencies in how Java determines codebase, that exposed additional paths to exploitation.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Inadequate Security Checks:** The browser did not properly validate the `codebase` parameter, allowing it to be set to `file:///`, thereby bypassing same-origin policies.
   - **Parameter Overriding:** The `<param name="codebase">` tag could override the `<object codebase>` attribute value as seen by Java, leading to a different context being used by the Java applet and the browser.
   - **Inconsistent URI Parsing:** Discrepancies in how the browser and Java parsed URIs, particularly with empty codebase strings and "file:", which could lead to unexpected access.
   - **Lack of Canonicalization:** Lack of canonicalization on the codebase passed to Java meant different interpretations could cause mismatches in security checks.
   - **Java Plugin Parameter Handling:** nsPluginInstanceOwner had quirks relating to how it passes parameters and attributes to plugins that did not correctly handle codebase.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Local File System Access:** A malicious Java applet could read arbitrary files on the user's local system, granting read-only access. This could be used to steal sensitive files if a known path could be used, or could be guessed.
   - **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of potentially sensitive files on the user's machine.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Local File Execution:** An attacker would need to convince a user to either open a local HTML file containing a malicious Java applet or trick them into downloading one.
   - **Known Path Requirement:** The attacker needed to know or guess the local path where the Java applet was saved on the user's system, which might include using techniques such as cache path guessing or employing other vulnerabilities to download applets to predictable locations.
   - **<object> and <applet> Tags:** The vulnerabilities were triggered using `<object>` or `<applet>` tags in HTML, with malicious variations in their `codebase` attributes or accompanying parameters.
   - **<embed> Tag issues** The code that forces the MIME type to x-java-vm only applies to <object> tags, creating a further attack surface.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Local Access:**  The attacker needs to trick the user into loading a malicious HTML file from their local system.
   - **Java Applet Creation:** The attacker would need to craft a Java applet with the ability to read local files using the vulnerability.
   - **Path Determination:** The attacker would need to find a way to determine the location of the local file to properly form the malicious URI for reading the desired files. This could be accomplished through guessing common cache paths, social engineering to encourage a download, or other vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

  - The content describes a series of patches and backouts made during development to address this and related vulnerabilities, including the introduction of a same-directory check and canonicalization of the codebase passed to Java.
   - This vulnerability was initially assigned a severity of 'moderate' but was later deemed 'high' as the full scope was uncovered and was labeled a security-high issue
   - The main fix for the vulnerability was developed alongside work on bug [738396](/show_bug.cgi?id=738396) - related to further inconsistencies in Java codebase handling - and has been incorporated into Firefox 23 and later.
   - The `codebase` attribute and parameter handling as well as missing security checks in the browser were the main vulnerabilities that lead to exploitation.
   - This vulnerability could only be exploited locally, not remotely.
