... there shouldn t be a limit at

oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=918229#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-05 18:17:16 UTC  ``` Finke Lamein reported that tuned's ktune service, which calls pmqos-static.py when the latency-performance profile is selected, would create its PID file with insecure permissions (0666).  A local user could use this flaw to kill arbitrary running processes when the ktune service is stopped.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=918233#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-05 18:27:33 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of Fedora.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When creating a Bodhi update request, please use the bodhi submission link noted in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the Bodhi notes field when available.  fedora-17 tracking bug for tuned: see blocks bug list for full details of the security issue(s).  [bug automatically created by: add-tracking-bugs]   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=918233#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-05 18:27:40 UTC  ```  Please use the following update submission link to create the Bodhi request for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  Please also ensure that the "Close bugs when update is stable" option remains checked.  Bodhi update submission link: <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/new/?type_=security&bugs=918229,918233>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=918233#c2)  Jaroslav Škarvada    2013-03-06 10:29:01 UTC  ``` Tuned 2.X is not affected by this issue, only tuned < 2.X is affected. In f17 updates there is: tuned-2.0.1-7.fc17   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=918233#c3)  Jaroslav Škarvada    2013-03-06 10:40:54 UTC  ``` But f17 is affected by similar security [bug 845336](show_bug.cgi?id=845336 "CLOSED ERRATA - /var/run/tuned/tuned.pid created with insecure permissions"), reopening. Feel free to close in case the another CVE would be needed.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=918233#c4)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 17:59:01 UTC  ``` Another CVE will be needed, but F17 is indeed affected by this issue.  Look at the code as I pointed out in the CVE bug.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=918233#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 23:38:27 UTC  ``` New submission link:  <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/new/?type_=security&bugs=918229,918233,918813>  The other issue has been assigned [CVE-2012-6136](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6136).  Both issues affect Fedora 17.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=918233#c6)  Jaroslav Škarvada    2013-03-07 10:50:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=918233#c4)) > Another CVE will be needed, but F17 is indeed affected by this issue.  Look > at the code as I pointed out in the CVE bug. > Sorry, I am currently tuned upstream, but I didn't get it. How the tuned-2.0.1-7.fc17 could be affected by:  ([CVE-2013-1820](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1820)) [CVE-2013-1820](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1820) tuned: insecure permissions of pmqos-static.pid   if there is no pmqos-static.pid nor pmqos-static daemon that should create this file?  To sort this out: tuned < 2:   - pmqos-static.pid created by pmqos-static daemon (in libexec/pmqos-static.py, write_pidfile), it is still vulnerable in RHEL-6, [bug 915628](show_bug.cgi?id=915628 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1820 /var/run/tuned/pmqos-static.pid created with insecure permissions [rhel-6.5]"), upstream fix: <http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/tuned.git/patch/?id=c89ad2149ce0425ff790e9c44f5b682e1eee4edc>   - tuned.pid created by tuned daemon (in tuned.py, tuned.run), it was silently fixed without CVE in RHEL-6 by previous tuned maintainer, [bug 845336](show_bug.cgi?id=845336 "CLOSED ERRATA - /var/run/tuned/tuned.pid created with insecure permissions"), upstream fix: <http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/tuned.git/patch/?id=9e8f67009568adce6b9a2f1d4c4c828b2192cba8>  tuned-2.0.X (tuned 2.X.X is different codebase/branch than RHEL-6 tuned < 2):  - no pmqos-static daemon, thus no pmqos-static.pid  - tuned.pid created by tuned daemon (in utils/daemon.py, _daemonize_fork()), still vulnerable in f17, upstream fix: <http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/tuned.git/patch/?id=3e98232fce6bd7abc8e73406fff4c7acc1617755>  tuned >= 2.1.0:  - no pmqos-static daemon, thus no pmqos-static.pid  - tuned.pid created by tuned daemon (now in application.py, Application.write_pid_file), correct code evolved from tuned-2.0.X  For me there are two distinct issues (from functional point of view) - pmqos-static.pid an tuned.pid vulnerability, but three different vulnerable points in the code. Does it mean we need third CVE?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=918233#c7)  Fedora End Of Life    2013-07-04 06:48:19 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 17 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 17. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '17'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 17's end of life.  Bug Reporter:  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that  we may not be able to fix it before Fedora 17 is end of life. If you  would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it  against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the  'version' to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 17's end of life.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=918233#c8)  Fedora End Of Life    2013-08-01 18:26:52 UTC  ``` Fedora 17 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2013-07-30. Fedora 17 is  no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further  security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of  Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ``` |  |
