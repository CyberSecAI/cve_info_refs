    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-1434",
      "root_cause": "SQL injection vulnerability",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary SQL commands execution, potentially leading to data breach or manipulation.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is present in the web interface (api_poller.php and utility.php) of Cacti.",
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to make requests to the Cacti web interface. No specific authentication requirements are mentioned in the provided content but access to the interface is likely required."

      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-1435",
      "root_cause": "Shell escaping issues in Cacti.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper escaping of user-controlled input when constructing shell commands. Specifically, it uses a custom escape function instead of escapeshellarg()."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability exists in how Cacti constructs shell commands specifically in snmp.php, and rrd.php when interacting with the underlying system to poll data and generate graphs.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have the ability to influence parameters used to build the shell command and access to the affected functions."
