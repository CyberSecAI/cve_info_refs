{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The sanitize helper in Ruby on Rails had bugs in the code that ensured URLs only contained supported protocols. This allowed an attacker to embed a tag with a URL that executes arbitrary javascript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could conduct XSS attacks against users of an application using Action Pack by embedding malicious Javascript in URLs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker embeds a malicious URL within a tag, which when processed by the application, executes arbitrary Javascript code within the user's browser."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious URLs into content processed by the vulnerable application."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "All versions of Ruby on Rails",
     "rubygem-actionpack versions prior to 3.1.12 and 3.2.13"

  "patches": [
    "Patches for 2.3, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 series are provided in git-am format",
     "Patches are available to address this vulnerability for users who are not able to upgrade immediately."

 "workarounds": [
    "Users who are unable to upgrade immediately can place specific code into a file in config/initializers to replace the vulnerable method with the correct implementation."
