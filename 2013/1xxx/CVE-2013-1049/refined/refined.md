Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the RFC1413 (ident) client within cfingerd. The `read()` function in `src/rfc1413.c` attempts to read up to 256 bytes into a buffer (`buf`) that is only 96 bytes large (defined as `2*INET6_ADDRSTRLEN`). This discrepancy between the read size and the buffer's capacity allows for a buffer overflow when the IDENT server sends a response larger than 96 bytes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow. When cfingerd queries a remote host's IDENT service, it allocates a buffer on the stack to receive the response. If the response exceeds the buffer's capacity, it overwrites adjacent memory locations, including potentially critical data and return addresses on the stack.
- **Inadequate Buffer Size Calculation:** The code uses `2*INET6_ADDRSTRLEN` to determine the buffer size, which is intended to store IPv6 addresses, but the data received from IDENT is not an IP address but a string, this results in buffer of 96 bytes, insufficient to hold a reasonable ident response string.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation on the size of the data received from the IDENT server. It doesn't check if the received response length is within the buffer's bounds before writing to it.
- **Unnecessary Root Privileges:** cfingerd runs as root on Ubuntu systems, which magnifies the impact of exploitation. Successful exploitation could grant a remote attacker root access on the vulnerable system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A large response from a malicious IDENT server can crash the cfingerd process due to a buffer overflow. This will cause the finger daemon to be unavailable.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** While the provided information notes that glibc on the reporter's system detects the overflow and raises SIGABRT, preventing code execution in that particular case. However, in a scenario where the overflow does not cause a crash or a crash does not occur due to a faulty memory allocator, an attacker can craft a malicious response to overwrite the stack, potentially leading to remote code execution with the privileges of the cfingerd process (which is root).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, making it particularly dangerous.
- **Crafted IDENT Response:** An attacker can set up a malicious IDENT server that sends an oversized response to a cfingerd query.
- **Finger Query Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered when a cfingerd instance receives a finger query from a non-local host.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the cfingerd process (port 79 by default) on the target machine.
- **Ability to Respond to IDENT Queries:** The attacker needs a controlled IDENT server to send a malicious crafted response to the vulnerable cfingerd instance, and be able to reach the vulnerable cfingerd process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced by a Debian-specific patch that attempted to add IPv6 support, as identified in the bug report.
- Patches to fix this issue were promptly developed and released for affected Ubuntu and Debian versions.
- The fix involves sanitizing the length of input buffers and allocating sufficient memory.
- The vulnerability was assigned a "grave" severity rating in Debian due to the potential for remote code execution.
