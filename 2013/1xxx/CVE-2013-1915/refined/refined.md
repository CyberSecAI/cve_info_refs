{
  "CVE-2013-1915": {
    "Description": "The XML files parser of ModSecurity, a security module for the Apache HTTP Server, was vulnerable to XML External Entity attacks. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when processed might lead to local files disclosure or, potentially, excessive resources (memory, CPU) consumption.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the XML parser of ModSecurity which is susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to improper handling of external entities in XML files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to disclose local files or cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory).",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a specially-crafted XML file to the server running ModSecurity.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests containing malicious XML to a server protected by ModSecurity.",
     "Patches": [
          "The issue was resolved by introducing a new 'SecXmlExternalEntity' option which is set to 'Off' by default, disabling the ability of libxml2 to load external entities.",
           "The fix is included in ModSecurity version 2.7.3 and later."
    ],
     "Affected Products": [
      "mod_security versions prior to 2.7.3",
      "openSUSE 11.4",
      "openSUSE 12.2",
      "openSUSE 12.3",
