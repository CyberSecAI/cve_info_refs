Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an unsafe use of PolicyKit by `apt-xapian-index`. Specifically, it was using the process ID (PID) for authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is described as a "policykit UID lookup race." This indicates a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability, where the UID associated with a PID can change between the time the UID is looked up by PolicyKit and the time the authorization is actually enforced by the program.
- **Insecure Authorization:**  Using PID for authorization checks is inherently insecure, as PIDs can be reused by different processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could bypass intended PolicyKit authorizations, potentially gaining elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be local to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the local system and trigger the vulnerable code path within `apt-xapian-index`.

**Technical Details**
- The fix involves changing `update-apt-xapian-index-dbus` to pass the system-bus-name as a subject instead of the PID to PolicyKit. This ensures that PolicyKit gets the correct information from the system bus, preventing the race condition.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Ubuntu versions:
    - 0.45ubuntu2.1 for Ubuntu 13.04 (raring)
    - 0.44ubuntu7.1 for Ubuntu 12.10 (quantal)
    - 0.44ubuntu5.1 for Ubuntu 12.04 (precise)
