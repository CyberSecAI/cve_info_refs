Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-1572:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Infinite and large loops within the dissectors for various protocols. Specifically, the vulnerability affects the Bluetooth HCI, CSN.1, DCP-ETSI, DOCSIS CM-STAUS, IEEE 802.3 Slow Protocols, MPLS, R3, RTPS, SDP, and SIP dissectors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way these dissectors handle certain malformed packets. Specifically, the dissectors enter into infinite or excessively large loops while processing these packets, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by injecting a malformed packet onto the network.
- Alternatively, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to open a malicious packet capture file containing such malformed packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject network traffic into a network being monitored by Wireshark, or needs to be able to supply a malicious packet capture file to a victim.
- No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is identified under `wnpa-sec-2013-01`.
- The issue was reported by Laurent Butti.
- The affected versions of Wireshark are 1.8.0 to 1.8.4, and 1.6.0 to 1.6.12.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in Wireshark versions 1.8.5 and 1.6.13.
- The openSUSE security updates reference this CVE and advise users to update to the fixed version of Wireshark.
