Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.  This advisory is available at the following link:  <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130327-nat>  Note: The March 27, 2013, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the March 2013 bundled publication.  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar13.html>  Affected Products  * This vulnerability affects devices that are running affected versions of Cisco IOS Software and have a VRF-aware NAT configuration.    Vulnerable Products Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable when they are configured for VRF-aware NAT.  There are two methods to determine whether a device is configured for VRF-aware NAT:    + Determine whether VRF-aware NAT commands are included in the device configuration.   + Determine whether VRF-aware NAT is active on a device.The preferred method to verify whether NAT is enabled on a Cisco IOS device is to inspect the device configuration to determine whether VRF-aware NAT commands are included in it.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableA Cisco IOS device is not vulnerable if the VRF-aware NAT feature is not configured. The following products have been confirmed not vulnerable:    + Cisco IOS XE Software   + Cisco IOS XR Software   + Cisco NX-OS Software   + Cisco ASA SofwareNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * A vulnerability exists in the VRF-aware NAT implementation of Cisco IOS Software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory starvation condition. The vulnerability issue is due to improper handling of a race condition that leads to a reduction in the available memory in the affected device. An attacker could repeatedly exploit this vulnerability, leading to a DoS condition. This vulnerability can be exploited using IP version 4 (IPv4) packets. A TCP three-way handshake is not required to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCtg47129](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtg47129) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCtz96745](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz96745) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1142.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.  This advisory is available at the following link:  <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130327-nat>  Note: The March 27, 2013, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the March 2013 bundled publication.  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar13.html>  Affected Products  * This vulnerability affects devices that are running affected versions of Cisco IOS Software and have a VRF-aware NAT configuration.    Vulnerable Products Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable when they are configured for VRF-aware NAT.  There are two methods to determine whether a device is configured for VRF-aware NAT:    + Determine whether VRF-aware NAT commands are included in the device configuration.   + Determine whether VRF-aware NAT is active on a device.The preferred method to verify whether NAT is enabled on a Cisco IOS device is to inspect the device configuration to determine whether VRF-aware NAT commands are included in it.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableA Cisco IOS device is not vulnerable if the VRF-aware NAT feature is not configured. The following products have been confirmed not vulnerable:    + Cisco IOS XE Software   + Cisco IOS XR Software   + Cisco NX-OS Software   + Cisco ASA SofwareNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * A vulnerability exists in the VRF-aware NAT implementation of Cisco IOS Software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory starvation condition. The vulnerability issue is due to improper handling of a race condition that leads to a reduction in the available memory in the affected device. An attacker could repeatedly exploit this vulnerability, leading to a DoS condition. This vulnerability can be exploited using IP version 4 (IPv4) packets. A TCP three-way handshake is not required to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCtg47129](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtg47129) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCtz96745](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz96745) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1142.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.1 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.1 |
