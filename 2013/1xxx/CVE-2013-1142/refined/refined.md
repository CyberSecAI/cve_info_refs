{
  "CVE-2013-1142": {
    "Description": "The Cisco IOS Software implementation of the virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) aware network address translation (NAT) feature contains a vulnerability when translating IP packets that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of a race condition in the VRF-aware NAT implementation leads to a reduction in available memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of race conditions"
    ],
    "Impact": "A memory starvation condition leading to a denial of service (DoS). The device may reload.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending IPv4 packets to a vulnerable device.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability. No TCP three-way handshake is required for exploitation."
