  "CVE-2013-1861": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is related to how MySQL handles the conversion of a binary string representation of a raw geometry object to a textual representation. Specifically, the length checks within MySQL's spatial functions can overflow, leading to a crash of the mysqld server. This can be triggered by a crafted SQL query involving geometry functions.",
    "affected_components": [
      "MySQL Server",
        "MariaDB"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in length checks during binary to text conversion of geometry objects",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) due to mysqld crash",
      "Potential information disclosure (depending on the context)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause the MySQL server to crash by sending a specially crafted query involving geometry functions.",
    "attack_vector": "Sending a specially crafted SQL query to the MySQL server.",
     "required_capabilities": "Ability to send SQL queries to a vulnerable MySQL/MariaDB instance. No authentication needed in some cases (see Oracle CPU description)."
