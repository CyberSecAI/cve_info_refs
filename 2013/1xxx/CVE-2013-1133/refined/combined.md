| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 0.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 0.0 |

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an interruption of voice services.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe following products are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.6(x)   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0(x)   Note: Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 6.1 reached the End of Software Maintenance on September 3, 2011. Customers using Cisco Unified Communications Manager 6.x versions should contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco Unified Communications Manager.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products are not affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.x   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.5(x)   No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager is the call processing component of the Cisco IP Telephony solution that extends enterprise telephony features and functions to packet telephony network devices, such as IP phones, media processing devices, VoIP gateways, and multimedia applications.       **Malformed UDP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains a DoS vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an exhaustion of resources in the CPU. This vulnerability is triggered by receiving malformed packets on unused UDP ports and could result in an inability to connect to the graphical user interface (GUI) and an interruption of voice services.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCtx43337](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx43337) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities Enumerator (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1133. This vulnerability applies to Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 8.6(x) and above and is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 9.0(1), 8.6(4) BE3k and 8.6(2a)su2. Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1(x) and 8.5(x) versions are not affected.      **Location Bandwidth Manager (LBM) Cache Poisoning Vulnerability**      Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0 contains a vulnerability   that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to poison the   Location Bandwidth Manager (LBM) transaction records.      The   vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication of the remote LBM Hub   node in the Intracluster communication between LBMs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by poisoning the LBM transaction records to consume all available bandwidth pools. An   exploit could allow the attacker to consume all bandwidth and deny   calls. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCub28920](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub28920) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1134. This vulnerability applies to Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 9.0(x) only and is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 9.1(1). Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1(x), 8.5(x) and 8.6(x) versions are not affected.  Workarounds  * Filtering traffic on TCP port 9004 from untrusted sources can provide a workaround for the LBM vulnerability.      Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in the network are available in the companion document "Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco IOS Software Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability" at the following location: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28034>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, also consult <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or later than the release in the "Recommended Release" column of the table.      | Cisco Unified Communication Manager Version | Recommended Release |   | --- | --- |   | 8.x | 8.6(4)BE3K, 8.6(2a)su2 |   | 9.x | 9.1(1) |            In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release.
