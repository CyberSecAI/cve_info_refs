Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-1133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the Cisco Unified Communications Manager improperly handling malformed UDP packets sent to unused ports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The system's resources (CPU) can be exhausted by receiving malformed packets on unused UDP ports. This can cause the GUI to become unreachable and disrupt voice services.
- **CWE-20:** Improper Input Validation. The system does not properly validate the incoming UDP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition, rendering the Cisco Unified Communications Manager unavailable for its intended functions, which includes call processing and managing telephony features.
- **Interruption of Voice Services:** The denial of service leads to the interruption of voice services, affecting communication capabilities.
- **GUI Unreachability:** The GUI becomes unreachable, hindering administrative tasks and troubleshooting.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **UDP Packets:** The attacker sends malformed UDP packets to unused ports on the Cisco Unified Communications Manager server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They only need network access to the vulnerable system.
- **Ability to Send Malformed UDP Packets:** The attacker must be able to craft and send specifically malformed UDP packets.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.6(x)
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0(x)

**Fixed Versions:**
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0(1)
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.6(4) BE3k
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.6(2a)su2
