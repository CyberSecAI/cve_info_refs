Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2013-1068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2013-1068 is that the Ubuntu packaging for OpenStack Cinder and Nova did not properly set up its sudo configuration. This means that under certain conditions, these services could be made to run programs with elevated (administrator) privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect sudo configuration:** The primary weakness is the improper setup of the sudo configuration for OpenStack Cinder and Nova. This allowed for potential privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** If another flaw was found in either OpenStack Cinder or Nova, this incorrect sudo configuration could be exploited to escalate privileges to the administrator level.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to run programs as an administrator would give an attacker the ability to perform malicious actions, execute arbitrary code, and potentially compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Exploitation requires a separate vulnerability to be present in the OpenStack Cinder or Nova services.
- This vulnerability would then be used to leverage the incorrect sudo configuration for privilege escalation.
- The attack is not directly exploitable on its own.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to exploit an unrelated vulnerability in the OpenStack Cinder or Nova service.
- Once a vulnerability is found and exploited in either service, the attacker could leverage this issue to run programs with administrator privileges.
- The attacker would likely need some form of access to the OpenStack environment, possibly as an authenticated user or potentially through another vulnerability, before they can attempt to escalate privileges.

**Additional Notes**

- This vulnerability specifically affected Ubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for the OpenStack Nova package, and Ubuntu 13.10 for the OpenStack Cinder package.
- The fix involves correcting the sudo configuration in the packaging.
- The identified vulnerability is a local privilege escalation and not a remote vulnerability.
