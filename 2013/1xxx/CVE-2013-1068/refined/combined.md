# USN-2247-1: OpenStack Nova vulnerabilities

17 June 2014

Several security issues were fixed in OpenStack Nova.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [nova](/security/cves?package=nova) - OpenStack Compute cloud infrastructure

## Details

Darragh O'Reilly discovered that the Ubuntu packaging for OpenStack Nova

did not properly set up its sudo configuration. If a different flaw was

found in OpenStack Nova, this vulnerability could be used to escalate

privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-1068](/security/CVE-2013-1068))

Bernhard M. Wiedemann and Pedraig Brady discovered that OpenStack Nova did

not properly verify the virtual size of a QCOW2 images. A remote

authenticated attacker could exploit this to create a denial of service via

disk consumption. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-4463](/security/CVE-2013-4463), [CVE-2013-4469](/security/CVE-2013-4469))

JuanFra Rodriguez Cardoso discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce

SSL connections when Nova was configured to use QPid and qpid\_protocol is

set to 'ssl'. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle

attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. Ubuntu

does not use QPid with Nova by default. This issue did not affect Ubuntu

14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-6491](/security/CVE-2013-6491))

Loganathan Parthipan discovered that OpenStack Nova did not properly create

expected files during KVM live block migration. A remote authenticated

attacker could exploit this to obtain root disk snapshot contents via

ephemeral storage. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-7130](/security/CVE-2013-7130))

Stanislaw Pitucha discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce the image

format when rescuing an instance. A remote authenticated attacker could

exploit this to read host files. In the default installation, attackers

would be isolated by the libvirt guest AppArmor profile. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0134](/security/CVE-2014-0134))

Mark Heckmann discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce RBAC policy

when adding security group rules via the EC2 API. A remote authenticated

user could exploit this to gain unintended access to this API. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0167](/security/CVE-2014-0167))
