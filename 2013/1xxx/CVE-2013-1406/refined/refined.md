- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the handling of control codes within the `vmci.sys` driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of control codes in the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) code, leading to a memory manipulation issue.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate memory allocation via VMCI, resulting in privilege escalation on Windows-based hosts and Windows-based guest operating systems.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with access to the vulnerable system or guest operating system can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on either a Windows-based host or a Windows-based guest operating system within the affected VMware environment. The attacker must be able to interact with the VMCI.
