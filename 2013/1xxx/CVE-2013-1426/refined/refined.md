Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1426:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the TinyMCE editor used within Mahara. Specifically, the HTML content entered into the editor was not being properly escaped before being rendered in the editor, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts or HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. This means that the malicious script is stored on the server (in this case, within the Mahara application) and then executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into Mahara via the TinyMCE editor.
- This could lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
   - Stealing user session cookies.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Defacing the website.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through the network by injecting malicious code through the TinyMCE editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker requires user interaction, as a user must hover over or interact with the malicious HTML/script after the injected content is loaded in the page with the TinyMCE editor.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Mahara versions before 1.5.9 and 1.6.x before 1.6.4.
- The vulnerability was reported by two independent researchers.
- The fix involves escaping the value sent to TinyMCE in `lib/form/elements/wysiwyg.php`.
- The vulnerability is present in the edit mode of the TinyMCE editor and is not properly escaped in view sections of the page, such as the profile information block type.
- The vulnerability is also present in new pages through the "Page Description" input.
- Patches were released to address the issue in versions 1.5.9 and 1.6.4 of Mahara.
