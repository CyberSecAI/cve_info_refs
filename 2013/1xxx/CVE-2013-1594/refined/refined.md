      "content": "The provided content is an advisory detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Vivotek IP cameras, including CVE-2013-1594. Here's the extracted information related to CVE-2013-1594:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to the storage of sensitive information in clear text within the device's configuration files. This information is exposed through GET requests.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Information Leak:** Sensitive information such as FTP credentials, share folder credentials, SMTP credentials, WEP/WPA keys, DynDNS credentials, Safe100.net credentials, and TZO credentials are stored in plain text and can be accessed via HTTP GET requests.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   An unauthenticated remote attacker can obtain sensitive information, which might be valuable to perform further attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The attacker sends specific HTTP GET requests to the camera. Examples provided include:\n    *   `http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/admin/getparam.cgi`\n    *   `http://192.168.1.100/setup/parafile.html`\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Vivotek IP camera. The attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The advisory mentions that requests may change according to firmware versions and vendors devices.\n*   The vulnerability was initially discovered and reported by Alejandro Leon Morales and re-discovered on new firmware versions by Flavio De Cristofaro from Core Security.",
