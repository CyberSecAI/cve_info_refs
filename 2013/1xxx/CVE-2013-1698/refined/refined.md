Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Firefox handles the display of the origin in the `getUserMedia` permission dialog when the request originates from a cross-domain iframe. Instead of displaying the iframe's origin, the dialog incorrectly shows the origin of the top-level document (the URL in the address bar).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Domain Spoofing:** The primary weakness is that a malicious website can embed a cross-domain iframe that requests camera or microphone access. The permission dialog will then display the top-level domain, potentially deceiving the user into thinking that the top-level, trusted domain is making the request rather than the malicious embedded iframe.
- **Inconsistent Origin Display:** The discrepancy between the actual origin of the `getUserMedia` request and the origin displayed in the permission dialog is a user interface (UI) flaw that could lead to security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Camera/Microphone:** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead a user to grant camera and/or microphone permissions to a malicious cross-domain iframe, under the false impression that the trusted top-level domain is requesting the permissions. This would allow the malicious iframe to record video and/or audio from the user without their full knowledge of the actual entity doing the recording.
- **Privacy Violation:** Malicious actors could potentially use this vulnerability to surreptitiously record users and compromise their privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Cross-Domain Iframes:** The attack vector involves using a cross-domain iframe embedded in a website.
- **`getUserMedia` API:** The vulnerability is triggered when the embedded iframe invokes the `getUserMedia` API to request camera or microphone access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Malicious Website/Iframe:** The attacker needs to host or inject a malicious website or an iframe in a website.
- **JavaScript execution:** The attacker needs to execute JavaScript code within the iframe to trigger the getUserMedia API call.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was initially classified as "sec-high" but was later downgraded to "sec-moderate".
- The fix involved ensuring that the permission dialog displayed the correct origin of the requesting iframe and also removing the host from the page-specific indicator ("You are currently sharing your camera with ...")
- The issue was fixed in Firefox 22 and backported to Aurora and Beta channels.
-  A related bug  was found where file:/// urls didn't show any origin, and that was later addressed in another bug.
