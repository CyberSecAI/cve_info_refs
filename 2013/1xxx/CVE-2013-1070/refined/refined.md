  "CVE-2013-1070": {
    "description": "The MAAS API was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. With XSS vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The MAAS API did not properly sanitize error messages returned to the user, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary javascript code in the admin's browser by tricking them into clicking a forged link. This could lead to modification of page content or theft of confidential data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A forged link or a crafted form sending a POST request to the vulnerable API endpoint."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and trick a user (typically an admin) into clicking the link. The attacker does not need any prior access to the system itself. "
