How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Forgot the reference, here's the exact code:
<https://github.com/ganglia/ganglia-web/commit/31d348947419058c43b8dfcd062e2988abd5058e#L7R17>

[Salvatore, thanks for forwarding it]

Some other notes:

* <https://github.com/ganglia/ganglia-web/commit/31d348947419058c43b8dfcd062e2988abd5058e#L9R35>

This is a directory traversal issue that requires authentication, but
there doesn't seem to be a CSRF protection in place (unless I'm
missing something).
The (stored) XSS part of it is not entirely fixed for the case where
an attacker successfully took advantage of it since the sanitation is
only performed when storing to the .json file.

The other operations related to views (in views_view.php) are all
still vulnerable to XSS via the view_name GET parameter.

The authentication cookie uses a persistent token for every user (no
session ids or any sort of nonce), which is an issue on its own, but
it also doesn't verify that the group stored in the cookie actually
corresponds to the user. As of 3.5.7 the groups feature still doesn't
seem to be in use, however.

So I guess we are going to need at least one more CVE id for the
remaining XSS issues in views_view.php and I leave the rest up to the
opinion of others (upstream included).

Cheers,
--
Raphael Geissert

Hi ganglia-web Developers!

Raphael Geissert discovered that there is still a XSS vulnerability via the view\_name GET parameter in views\_view.php. See [1](http://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=136191082830285&w=2).
