Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization of the `view_name` GET parameter in the `views_view.php` file of Ganglia web frontend. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code via this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected via the `view_name` parameter, which are then executed in the context of the user's browser.
-   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `view_name` parameter, allowing arbitrary input. This lack of validation is the core weakness that enables the XSS attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
-   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies or session tokens, leading to session hijacking and account takeover.
-   **Data Theft:** An attacker could use malicious scripts to steal sensitive information from the user, like potentially other information displayed on the web page.
-   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance of the website.
-   **Phishing:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or overlay fake login forms.
-   **Malware Distribution:** Injected scripts could potentially redirect the user to a website hosting malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **HTTP GET Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing a malicious payload in the `view_name` GET parameter.
-   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to access a specially crafted URL containing the malicious payload in the `view_name` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious Javascript code.
-   **Social Engineering/Link Distribution:** The attacker must induce a user to visit the crafted URL. This could be achieved by sending the URL via email or chat, or by embedding it in a malicious website.
-   **No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability**.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Raphael Geissert.
*   The vulnerability was initially reported along with other XSS issues and was later assigned its own CVE ID.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `552965f33bf79d41ccbec3f1f26840c8bab54ad6`, by adding a check `is_proper_view_name` on the view_name parameter before it is used.
*   The `is_proper_view_name` function allows alphanumeric characters, spaces, underscores, and dashes.

This vulnerability is specifically a reflected XSS vulnerability and is separate from other stored XSS issues also present in the application.
