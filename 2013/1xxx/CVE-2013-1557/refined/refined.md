Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `LogStream.setDefaultStream()` method within the Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) component. This method lacked proper security restrictions, allowing an untrusted Java application or applet to potentially set a custom `PrintStream` for RMI logging.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Security Restriction:** The primary weakness is the absence of a security check before allowing a new default `PrintStream` to be set.
*   **Potential for Abuse:** The lack of restriction means that a malicious application could redirect RMI logging output, potentially to a location of the attacker's choosing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Bypass:** By exploiting this, an untrusted application or applet could potentially bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This can enable unauthorized access to the system and other malicious activities.
*   **Information Leak:** Attackers could redirect RMI log messages to a location they control, allowing them to obtain sensitive information that may be included in the logs.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In conjunction with other vulnerabilities, it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the target system by manipulating the log output or redirecting the output stream.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Untrusted Java Application/Applet:** The attack vector is an untrusted Java application or applet that attempts to call the `LogStream.setDefaultStream()` method.
*   **RMI component:** The specific vulnerability lies in the RMI component, so it is related to remote method invocations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute Java Code:** The attacker needs the ability to execute a malicious Java application or applet. This could be achieved through user interaction (e.g., visiting a malicious website that runs a Java applet) or by deploying a malicious Java application on the system.
*   **Knowledge of Target System and Java Security:** They need to understand the target systemâ€™s configuration and the Java security model to craft their exploit effectively.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a security manager check, specifically `sm.checkPermission(new java.util.logging.LoggingPermission("control", null))` to the `setDefaultStream()` method. This ensures that only privileged code is allowed to change the default log stream, thus preventing unauthorized access.
*   Multiple sources mention that this issue is resolved in IcedTea6 versions 1.11.10 and 1.12.5, and IcedTea7 version 2.3.9, indicating that the vulnerability was addressed in the open source Java distributions.
*   Several Linux distributions, including Red Hat, OpenSUSE, and Mageia, issued security advisories and updates to address this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2013-1557 is a security vulnerability related to insecure access control in the `LogStream.setDefaultStream()` method within the Java RMI component. This could be exploited by malicious Java applications or applets to bypass security restrictions and gain unauthorized access or leak information.
