# Geeklog 1.8.2sr1 and 2.0.0rc2

* Wednesday, February 20 2013 @ 05:40 am EST
* Contributed by: [Dirk](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=408)

[![Security](https://www.geeklog.net/images/topics/security.png "Security")](https://www.geeklog.net/index.php/topic/Security)

We have received two reports about security issues that affect Geeklog in both current versions, i.e. 1.8.2 and 2.0.0 (which is not officially out yet, but in release candidate state):

* High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab reported an XSS in the calendar\_type parameter in the Calendar plugin.
* Trustwave Spiderlabs reported XSS in the install script, the Configuration, as well as in the Admin interfaces for the Polls plugin and the Topic editor.

To address these issues, we are releasing [Geeklog 1.8.2sr1](https://www.geeklog.net/downloads/index.php/1102) (complete archive; also available as an [update from 1.8.2](https://www.geeklog.net/downloads/index.php/1104)) and [Geeklog 2.0.0rc2](https://www.geeklog.net/downloads/index.php/1103).

In addition to the security fixes, Geeklog 1.8.2sr1 also fixes a problem with the Twitter OAuth login. Geeklog 2.0.0rc2 includes further (non-security) bugfixes for this major update.

While the reported security issues are not easy to exploit (due to other security measures in Geeklog), we strongly suggest that you install these updates as soon as possible. Also, be careful when clicking on external links while being logged in as an Admin user - especially when you are unexpectedly prompted for your password.

Can you post a Geeklog 1.8.1 to 1.8.2sr1 Upgrade file?

It looks like Dirk got to it first. Use this first:

My request was for you to combine it into Geeklog 1.8.1 to 1.8.2sr1 Upgrade.

I definitely posted this comment in the right place. Looks like it's a bug that was posted as a brand new comment.

Why? We have never provided such upgrades in the past. In fact, the 1.8.2 upgrade package that Tom provided was already an exception - we only provide such "diff" upgrades for security issues. Is it really that much work for you to download and install two such files?

I'm all for making updates as easy as possible, but please consider that it's a lot of work for us to provide all these extra archives. And where will it stop? Someone is surely going to ask for a "diff" archive from 1.8.0 next ...

I'd say it should stop one version before the latest. No more, no less.

It's needed because some of us use custom files. This requires re-customization every time a new version comes out. In this case it means double re-customization.

### Geeklog 2.0.0rc2 Bug Fix

Authored by: [Laugh](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=11721) on Friday, February 22 2013 @ 10:08 am EST

There is a small bug in Geeklog 2.0.0rc2 that creates double lines in articles that use plain text mode. To fix please replace the COM\_nl2br funtion in lib-common.php with:

function COM\_nl2br($string)
{
 if (! defined('XHTML')) {
 define('XHTML', '');
 }

 $replace = '<br' . XHTML . '>';
 $find = array("\r\n", "\n\r", "\r", "\n");
 return str\_replace($find, $replace, $string);
}
