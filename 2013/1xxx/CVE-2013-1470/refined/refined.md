Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities addressed in Geeklog 1.8.2sr1 and 2.0.0rc2, which relate to CVE-2013-1470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in various parts of the Geeklog CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XSS in Calendar Plugin:** Specifically, an XSS vulnerability exists within the `calendar_type` parameter of the Calendar plugin.
*   **XSS in Install Script, Configuration, Polls Plugin, and Topic Editor:** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities were discovered in the installation script, configuration settings, the admin interfaces for the Polls plugin, and the Topic editor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
*   Execute malicious scripts in the browsers of other users.
*   Potentially hijack user sessions.
*   Modify displayed content on the site.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's session and permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Calendar Plugin XSS:** The attack vector is through the `calendar_type` parameter in the Calendar plugin, likely via a crafted URL or form submission.
*   **Other XSS:** The other XSS vulnerabilities are located in the install script, configuration settings, and administrative interfaces for the Polls plugin and Topic editor. These may be exploitable through malicious input during installation, configuration changes or through crafted form submissions in the admin panels.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious input for the vulnerable parameters/fields.
*   In some cases, the attacker would need to convince a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious link. However, the impact is severe even without an administrator being involved as XSS can potentially be used on any user.
*   No specific network position is mentioned, suggesting that the attacker could be external.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The text mentions that while exploitation may not be easy "due to other security measures in Geeklog," users are still urged to update, implying some layers of defense exist but are not foolproof.
*   The update also includes a fix for a Twitter OAuth login issue and other bugfixes.
*   The XSS vulnerabilities were reported by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab and Trustwave Spiderlabs.
