Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1671:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Firefox handles the `<input>` control with the `file` type. It was possible to exploit this control to access the full local file path of the selected file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the ability to retrieve the full path of a file selected using a file input control. This leaks potentially sensitive information about the user's file system structure.
- **Bypassing Restrictions:** The vulnerability was made possible by the ability to exploit XBL (XML Binding Language) bugs to bypass security restrictions related to the file input.
  
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** Attackers could potentially learn the complete file system paths of users, which could then be leveraged to further target attacks.
- **Local File System Attacks:** Information about file paths could be combined with other exploits to target attacks on the local file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker could host a malicious website that exploits this vulnerability to gain access to file paths when a user selects a file. The user has to willingly select a file on their system through the file input control.
- **XBL Exploitation:** The vulnerability leverages XBL bugs, indicating that the attack involves manipulation or exploitation of XBL functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of XBL:** The attacker needs knowledge of XBL vulnerabilities to exploit the file input control.
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a web page that contains the malicious code.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the user to interact with the malicious page and willingly select a file on their local system using the `<input type="file">` control.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Mozilla security researcher `moz_bug_r_a4`.
- The vulnerability was addressed by changes related to [bug 838675](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=838675), which modified how file paths are handled in the `input type="file"` control. Specifically, the fix prevents the display of the full file path.
- Fixes for other XBL related vulnerabilities such as  [CVE-2013-1711](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=843829) and [bug 844211](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=844211) also contributed to mitigating this issue.
- The vulnerability was considered a moderate security issue.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 21.
- The issue was not backported to ESR17 or B2G18 branches due to the complexity and risk involved.
