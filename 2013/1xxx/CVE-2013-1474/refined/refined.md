  "CVE-2013-1474": {
    "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist within the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), specifically affecting JavaFX components.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Multiple vulnerabilities exist within the JavaFX component of the JRE.",
        "These vulnerabilities can be exploited by loading a malicious Java applet or Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file.",
        "The Java plug-in, the Java Deployment Toolkit plug-in, and Java Web Start can be used as attack vectors."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the Java plug-in process. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected system, potentially granting the attacker full control.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Web browsers using the Java plug-in are at high risk, as an attacker could use social engineering techniques to entice a user to visit a website hosting a malicious Java applet.",
      "An attacker could also compromise a legitimate website and upload a malicious Java applet (drive-by download attack).",
         "Exploitation can occur through specially crafted HTML documents, and applications that use Internet Explorer web content rendering components (e.g., Microsoft Office, Windows Desktop Search)."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious Java applet or JNLP file.",
      "The attacker needs to convince a user to load the malicious applet, typically by enticing a user to visit a specially crafted web page, or by compromising a legitimate website.",
      "No authentication is needed for remote exploitation."
    ],
    "Additional Details": "This CVE is one of many addressed in the Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update - February 2013. It is listed as having a CVSS base score of 9.3, indicating high severity. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, with medium complexity, and without authentication. The impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is complete."
