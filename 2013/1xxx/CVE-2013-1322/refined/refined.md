Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-1322:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Publisher improperly validates table range data while parsing specially crafted Publisher files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   An invalid range check during the parsing of Publisher files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution.
*   An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user.
*   If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** An attacker sends a specially crafted Publisher file to the user, convincing them to open it.
*   **Web-based:** An attacker hosts a website containing a malicious Publisher file, or injects it into compromised websites. The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the website and open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Publisher file.
*   The attacker needs to deliver this file to the victim, either via email or by hosting it on a website, and convince the user to open it.
*   No special privileges are required by the attacker. They need only to trick a user into opening the file.

**Affected Software:**

*   Microsoft Publisher 2003 Service Pack 3

**Mitigating Factors:**

*   Users with fewer rights will be less impacted than users with administrative rights.
*   Exploitation requires user interaction to open a malicious file.

**Workarounds:**

*   Avoid opening Publisher files from untrusted sources or unexpectedly from trusted sources.
