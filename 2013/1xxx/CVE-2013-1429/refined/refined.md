{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2013-1429",
    "description": "Lintian before 2.5.12 allows remote attackers to gather information about the \"host\" system using crafted symlinks.",
    "affected_component": "Lintian",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of symlinks by Lintian during package analysis. When processing a package, Lintian could be tricked into following symlinks that pointed outside of the package, potentially revealing sensitive information about the host system.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Path traversal",
       "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could craft a malicious package containing carefully constructed symlinks, which would allow them to gain access to data outside the intended scope of the package during the linting process. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information about the \"host\" system on which Lintian is being run.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to craft a malicious package that would then be processed by Lintian.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create and provide a crafted package to be processed by Lintian. No special privileges are required to create such a package.",
        "cvss_score": "6.3",
         "severity": "Medium",
    "remediation": "The vulnerability was fixed in Lintian version 2.5.12 and 2.5.10.5 by implementing proper symlink handling.",
