Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Internet Explorer (versions 8 and 9) reuses existing HTTPS connections through a proxy when the same proxy is used for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.  IE's proxy component fails to properly track the actual target of these reused connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Connection Reuse with Incorrect Target Tracking:** After establishing multiple HTTPS connections, IE reuses these connections for subsequent requests, even if those requests are intended for different target websites.
*   **Proxy Blindness:** The proxy server is unaware of the data being tunneled through the reused HTTPS connection, making it unable to prevent the vulnerability.
*   **Mismatched Host Headers and SNI:** While RFC 6066 specifies that web servers *should* check if the Host header and SNI match, the described vulnerability exploits the fact that not all web servers enforce this check, particularly when the proxy server does not enforce the check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:**  Attackers can steal cookies by redirecting requests to a malicious server. This includes cookies used for authentication, potentially granting unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Although not a traditional MitM, the attacker effectively acts as a "man-in-the-middle" by intercepting and redirecting requests to their own server, leading to the leakage of session information.
*   **Fake Secure Connections:**  The vulnerability can make users believe they are securely connected to a legitimate site (e.g., www.google.com) while they are actually communicating with an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The instability of IE after interacting with the crafted website hints at other exploitable vulnerabilities, although the provided text doesn't go into details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The attack is initiated by a user visiting a specially crafted malicious website. This website contains forms, scripts, and iframes designed to trigger the connection reuse vulnerability.
*   **HTTPS Connection Reuse:** After an initial set of HTTPS connections are established to the proxy server and then the actual target server through the proxy, subsequent requests intended for other websites are tunneled through these existing HTTPS connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious Website Hosting:** The attacker needs a web server to host the crafted malicious website.
*   **Proxy Server Awareness:**  The attacker leverages the fact that the user's browser is configured to use the same proxy server for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
*   **Web Server Control:** The attacker controls a web server that can receive the redirected traffic and harvest any cookies sent.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand how IE's proxy connection reuse works to create the malicious website properly.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Internet Explorer 8 and 9.
*   The attack leverages the lack of strict enforcement of host header and SNI checks by some web servers.
*   The mitigation suggested is to change proxy configurations to not use the same proxy for HTTP and HTTPS.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft in 2011, but Microsoft didn't classify it as high risk and will not patch IE 8 & 9.

This analysis provides significantly more detail than what is typically found in a basic CVE description, particularly the attack flow and the proxy reuse weakness.
