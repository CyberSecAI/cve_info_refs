Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the IKE version 1 implementation in Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FWSM Software.
*   It's caused by the incorrect processing of incoming IKE version 1 messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of IKEv1 messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, resulting in a reload of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker sends a crafted IKE version 1 message to the vulnerable device.
*   Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
*   Both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic can trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the targeted Cisco ASA or FWSM device.
*   No prior authentication is needed.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious IKEv1 message.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This vulnerability affects both Cisco ASA software and Cisco FWSM software.
*   For Cisco ASA, IKEv1 must be enabled via the command `crypto isakmp enable` (Cisco ASA Software 8.3.x and earlier) or `crypto ikev1 enable` (Cisco ASA Software 8.4.x and later)
*   For Cisco FWSM, IKEv1 must be enabled via the command `isakmp enable`.
*   IKEv1 is not enabled by default on either device.
*   The vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub85692 for ASA and CSCud20267 for FWSM
