Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2013-1313:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the way OLE Automation parses a specially crafted file, specifically related to how memory is allocated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can achieve remote code execution by exploiting the flaw in how OLE Automation handles memory when parsing files.
- Improper memory allocation when parsing files leading to use-after-free conditions (though not explicitly specified in CVE-2013-1313 itself, it's a common cause for this type of RCE).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Complete Control:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can perform any action on the system.
- **Malicious Activities:** An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Files:** The attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted file.
- **Email:** An attacker could send a specially crafted RTF file as an email attachment or embed the malicious data within the email itself. If Microsoft Word is used as the email viewer, opening the email can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker could host a website containing a specially crafted file that exploits the vulnerability. Compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content could also be used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Crafting a malicious file:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted file that triggers the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file. This can be through social engineering in the case of email attacks or by enticing users to visit a malicious website.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for Windows XP Service Pack 3.
- The vulnerability was privately reported, and there were no known exploits when the security bulletin was originally issued.
- Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Workarounds:**
The provided documents also detail workarounds to mitigate the risk before applying the patch:
- Do not open Microsoft Office and WordPad documents from untrusted sources.
- Prevent ActiveX controls from running in Office 2007 and Office 2010.
- Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting.
- Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.
- Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations.
