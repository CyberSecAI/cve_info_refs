Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication of the remote Location Bandwidth Manager (LBM) Hub node during intercluster communication between LBMs in Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper authentication for LBM Hub nodes during intercluster communication. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to interact with the LBM.
*  **LBM Cache Poisoning:** The lack of authentication enables an attacker to poison the LBM transaction records.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By poisoning the LBM transaction records, an attacker can consume all available bandwidth pools, leading to a denial of service. This can prevent users from making calls.
*   **Interruption of Voice Services:** Exploitation can directly cause an interruption of voice services, as bandwidth is exhausted, thus affecting communication capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without requiring any prior authentication.
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco Unified Communications Manager system.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 9.0(x) is vulnerable.
*   Versions 7.x, 8.5(x), and 8.6(x) are not affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   Filtering traffic on TCP port 9004 from untrusted sources can mitigate the LBM vulnerability.
*   Upgrading to Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 9.1(1) fixes the issue.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified by Cisco Bug ID CSCub28920.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing by Cisco, and they are not aware of any public exploits at the time of the advisory.
*   The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 7.8, with a temporal score of 6.4.
