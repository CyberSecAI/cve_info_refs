Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1839:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the code responsible for parsing the `Accept-Language` header during error response language negotiation within the Squid proxy cache.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A bug in the `strHdrAcptLangGetItem()` function causes an infinite loop. This occurs when parsing the `Accept-Language` header for error responses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The infinite loop consumes 100% of the CPU, preventing Squid from servicing any traffic.
- This effectively renders the proxy cache unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a malicious `Accept-Language` header.
- The attack vector is through the network, as crafted HTTP requests can be sent from any source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the Squid server.
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Squid proxy.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Squid versions 3.2 up to 3.2.8 and 3.3 up to 3.3.2
- It is fixed in Squid versions 3.2.9 and 3.3.3
- Workarounds include either disabling language auto-negotiation by configuring an explicit error directory or building Squid with the `--disable-auto-locale` option.
- The vulnerability was reported by Kurt Seifried of the Red Hat Security Response Team.
