| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software IP Service Level Agreement Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20130327-ipsla  First Published: 2013 March 27 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2013 April 12 14:44 GMT  Version 1.3:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuc72594](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc72594)     CVE-2013-1148     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2013-1148     CWE-20       [Download OVAL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130327-ipsla/oval/cisco-sa-20130327-ipsla_258.xml)   Email      Summary  * The Cisco IOS Software implementation of the IP Service Level Agreement (IP SLA) feature contains a vulnerability in the validation of IP SLA packets that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Mitigations for this vulnerability are available.  This advisory is available at the following link: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130327-ipsla>  Note: The March 27, 2013, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the March 2013 bundled publication.  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar13.html>  Affected Products  * This vulnerability affects a device that is running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software and has a vulnerable IP SLA general responder configuration.    Vulnerable Products Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable when they are configured for the IP SLA general responder feature.  There are two methods to determine whether a device is configured for the IP SLA general responder:    + Determine whether the IP SLA general responder command is included in the device configuration.   + Determine whether the IP SLA general responder is active on a running device.The preferred method to verify whether IP SLA is enabled on a Cisco IOS device is to inspect the device configuration to determine whether IP SLA general responder is configured.Determine Whether IP SLA General Responder Command Is Included in the Device Configuration To determine whether the IP SLA general responder has been enabled in the Cisco IOS Software configuration. The **ip sla responder** global configuration command must be present The **show running-config | include ip sla responder** command can be used to determine whether IP SLA is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example:  ```   Router> show running-config | include ip sla responder$   ip sla responder   Router>      ``` Determine Whether IP SLA General Responder Is Active on a Running Device The administrator can establish whether the IP SLA general responder is enabled on a Cisco IOS device by using the **show ip sla responder | include ^General** command. If the vulnerable IP SLA general responder is active, the output will include a line with **Enabled**.  The following example shows a device on which the vulnerable IP SLA responder is active:  ```   Router# show ip sla responder | include ^General   General IP SLA Responder is: Enabled   Router#       ``` Determine the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableA Cisco IOS device is not vulnerable if the IP SLA general responder feature is not configured. The following products have been confirmed not vulnerable:    + Cisco IOS XR Software   + Cisco NX-OS Software   + Cisco ASA SoftwareNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The IP SLA Responder is a component embedded in a Cisco routing device that allows the system to anticipate and respond to IP SLA request packets.   There are two types of IP SLA responders:    + **IP SLA general responder** uses the IP SLA Control Protocol to set up IP SLA operations and receives packets on UDP port 1167 or on UDP port 1967.   + **IP SLA permanent responder** receives either UDP or TCP packets on a user-configurable port. A vulnerability in the implementation of the IP Service Level Agreement **general responder** feature of   Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the vulnerable device.   The vulnerability is due to improper validation of IP SLA packets only when they are received on UDP port 1167.   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IP SLA packets addressed to the affected device.   An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an extended DoS condition.  This vulnerability can be exploited via IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6).  Neither the IP SLA general responder on UDP port 1967 nor the permanent UDP responder are affected by this vulnerability.  This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID   [CSCuc72594](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc72594) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID   CVE-2013-1148.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability but there are mitigations that can be deployed on a general IP SLA responder to reduce the exposure to this vulnerability such as infrastructure access lists.  Conventional mitigation techniques such as IP SLA key chains or control plane protection are not an effective mitigation for this vulnerability.  For devices configured as general responders, mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document "Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco IOS Software IP Service Level Agreement Vulnerability," which is available at <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=27842>.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.
