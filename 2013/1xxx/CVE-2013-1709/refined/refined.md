Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey handle replace loads in subframes, particularly when interacting with browser history and the Back-Forward Cache (BFCache). Specifically, `nsDocShell::AddToSessionHistory` reuses existing session history entries (`SHEntry`) without creating new BFCache entries during replace loads within subframes. This behavior leads to `nsDocShell::InternalLoad` performing short-circuited loads between different documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Document URI Misrepresentation**: The core issue is that the browser can be tricked into believing that attacker-supplied content originates from a different location than its actual source.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The ability to misrepresent a document's URI allows attackers to inject and execute scripts from a malicious site by exploiting relative URL references.
-  **Credential Theft**: Attackers can create fake login pages with the same URI as legitimate ones, potentially leading to the automatic filling of saved credentials from the Password Manager, enabling credential theft without direct user interaction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **XSS attacks**: Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the misrepresented document's domain.
-   **Credential theft:** Unauthorized access to stored user credentials for spoofed websites.
-   **Spoofing**: Users may be misled into believing they are interacting with a legitimate website.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack involves loading malicious content within a subframe using a "replace load" operation.
-   The attacker manipulates browser history and BFCache to misrepresent the source of the content to the browser.
-   The attacker leverages relative URLs in scripts to execute malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to serve content that the victim's browser will load within a subframe.
-   The attacker needs to construct content that exploits the described behavior with `nsDocShell::AddToSessionHistory` and `nsDocShell::InternalLoad` during a replace load and browser history interaction.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability was reported by a Mozilla security researcher with the alias **moz\_bug\_r\_a4**.
- The vulnerability is rated as **High Impact**.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and Thunderbird ESR.
- Patches were included in Firefox 23, Firefox ESR 17.0.8, SeaMonkey 2.20, Thunderbird 17.0.8, and Thunderbird ESR 17.0.8.
- The provided bug report includes details of test cases that demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The fix involves changes to how session history and BFCache are handled.
- The fix was considered somewhat regression risky, due to the changes in session history handling, but the security risk was high enough that it was deemed necessary to ship it.
- A flag `network.jar.open-unsafe-types` may need to be set to true for certain testcases to work.

The content provides a good amount of detail about the vulnerability beyond the basic CVE description, including the specifics of how it can be exploited.
