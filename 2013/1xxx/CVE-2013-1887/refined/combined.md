Those are the same issues (it's possible to get from SA-CONTRIB-2013-035
link to the <http://drupal.org/node/1948354> link [just click in at
Views 7.x-3.6 in SA-CONTRIB-2013-035]).

In yet other words, looks like CVE-2013-1887 (previously) occurred at
various places. Relevant upstream patch seems to be this one:
  <http://drupalcode.org/project/views.git/commitdiff/ddf8181bd13f69ffbeeee14ae72168418785d7ac>

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

The security issue in views is caused by various places in the views
UI where a string is not sanitized,
because it has been assumed to be static and by commiters, though you
can change some of these strings using other administrative
permissions. SA-CONTRIB-2013-035 - Views - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

I'm a bit confused, is this via SA-CONTRIB-2013-035 or a separate
issue as well?

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-035 - Views - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

---

*From*: security-news () drupal org

*Date*: Wed, 20 Mar 2013 20:42:22 +0000 (UTC)

---

```
View online: <http://drupal.org/node/1948358>

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-035
  * Project: Views [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-March-20
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

The Views module provides a flexible method for Drupal site designers to
control how lists and tables of content, users, taxonomy terms and other data
are presented.

The module incorrectly prints some view configuration fields without proper
sanitization opening a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "Administer vocabularies and terms" or other
administer-related permissions from contributed modules that integrate with
Views.

-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

  * Views 7.x-3.x versions prior to 7.x-3.6.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Views [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Views module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Views 7.x-3.6 [5]

Also see the Views [6] project page.

-------- REPORTED BY
---------------------------------------------------------

  * Francisco José Cruz Romanos [7]

-------- FIXED BY
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Francisco José Cruz Romanos [8]
  * Daniel Wehner [9] the module maintainer

-------- COORDINATED BY
------------------------------------------------------

  * Greg Knaddison [10] of the Drupal Security Team
  * Ben Jeavons [11] of the Drupal Security Team
  * David Stoline [12] provisional member of the Drupal Security Team

-------- CONTACT AND MORE INFORMATION
----------------------------------------
