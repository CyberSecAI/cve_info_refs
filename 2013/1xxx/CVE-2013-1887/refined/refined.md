Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-1887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the Views module in Drupal not sanitizing certain view configuration fields. These fields were incorrectly assumed to be static by the module's committers, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
  - Stealing cookies and session tokens
  - Defacing websites
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the Views UI, specifically through unsanitized configuration strings within the module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a role with the permission "Administer vocabularies and terms" or other administer-related permissions from contributed modules that integrate with Views. This requirement limits exploitation to users who have elevated privileges within the Drupal site.
