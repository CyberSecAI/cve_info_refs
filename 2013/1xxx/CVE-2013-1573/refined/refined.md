Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from infinite or large loops within several dissectors in Wireshark. Specifically for CVE-2013-1573, it is identified as the GSM RLC MAC dissector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is the presence of code in the dissectors that, when encountering specific malformed or crafted packets, can enter an infinite loop or an extremely large loop. This causes the program to continuously execute a loop, consuming excessive CPU resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where Wireshark becomes unresponsive due to the consumption of CPU resources, rendering it unable to analyze network traffic or possibly leading to program termination.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by injecting a specially crafted malformed packet into the network being monitored by Wireshark. Alternatively, they can convince a Wireshark user to open a malicious packet capture file containing the malformed packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to inject network traffic that Wireshark is analyzing, or to deliver a malicious packet capture file to a victim. The attacker doesn't need to be on the same machine as Wireshark, they just need to be able to provide the malformed input.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that multiple dissectors were affected by this type of looping vulnerability, including Bluetooth HCI, CSN.1, DCP-ETSI DOCSIS CM-STAUS, IEEE 802.3 Slow Protocols, MPLS, R3, RTPS, SDP, and SIP dissectors. This information is tied to the broader issue of infinite loops (wnpa-sec-2013-01), and multiple CVEs were assigned to track individual dissector vulnerabilities. CVE-2013-1573 specifically identifies the GSM RLC MAC dissector.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark versions 1.8.5 and 1.6.13.
*   The openSUSE security updates reference the fix for this vulnerability, highlighting that affected systems should be patched with the updated wireshark package.
