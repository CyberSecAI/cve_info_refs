| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software for 1000 Series ASR will vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the Software Versions and Fixes section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions.      Vulnerable ProductsFor specific version information, refer to the Software Versions and Fixes section of this advisory.         **Cisco IOS XE Software IPv6 Multicast Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability** and **Cisco IOS XE Software MVPNv6 Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability**   These vulnerabilities are triggered when a fragmented multicast IP version 6 (IPv6) or a fragmented IPv6 Multicast VPN (MVPNv6) packet is received by an affected Cisco ASR device. The fragmented multicast packet processed by Cisco Multicast Leaf Recycle Elimination (MLRE) may cause a Cisco ESP card on the Cisco ASR device to reload.   Multiple features configured on the Cisco ASR 1000 may trigger this kind of processing that will lead to a crash.      Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected if IPv6 is enabled on an interface that is processing traffic and MLRE is enabled on the affected device.      To determine whether IPv6 is enabled on an interface use the **show run | include ipv6.(enable|address)**   privileged EXEC command. The presence of **ipv6 enable** and **ipv6 address** in the output of **show run | include ipv6.(enable|address)** indicates that IPv6 is enabled.   The following is the output of the ****show run | include ipv6.(enable|address)**** in a Cisco IOS XE Software that shows the device is configured for IPv6: ```   asr1004# show run | include ipv6.(enable|address) ipv6 enable    ipv6 address dhcp rapid-commit ipv6 address autoconfig    ipv6 address MANAGEMENT ::1FFF:0:0:0:3560/128 ipv6 address 2001:DB8::1/64   ``` There is currently no way to determine if Cisco MLRE is enabled on the device.      **Note:** The Cisco MLRE feature is introduced in Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.4.1S and is enabled by default on all later versions of Cisco IOS XE Software on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with Embedded Services Processor 40 (ASR1000-ESP40) or Embedded Services Processor 100 (ASR1000-ESP100). Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with Embedded Services Processor 40 (ASR1000-ESP40) or Embedded Services Processor 100 (ASR1000-ESP100) are affected by this vulnerability.      To determine whether a Cisco ASR 1000 device has ASR1000-ESP40 or ASR1000-ESP100 installed, administrators can issue the **show inventory** command. The following is the output of the **show inventory** in a Cisco IOS XE Software running on a Cisco ASR 1006 Router with Embedded Services Processor 40 (ASR1000-ESP40):          asr1006#show inventory    NAME: "Chassis", DESCR: "Cisco ASR1006 Chassis"    PID: ASR1006    NAME: "module F1", DESCR: "Cisco ASR1000 Embedded Services Processor, 40Gbps"    PID: ASR1000-ESP40             **Note:** Cisco IOS devices configured to process multicast IPv6 or MVPNv6 traffic are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.            **Cisco IOS XE Software L2TP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability**       Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload when processing of a large amount of specific Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) packets when L2TP Network Server (LNS) termination or L2TPv3 Ethernet Pseudowire (xconnect) is enabled. L2TP LNS termination and xconnect are not enabled by default.      To verify if L2TP LNS termination is enabled on a device use the **show run | include accept-dialin** privileged EXEC command. The presence of ****accept-dialin**** in the output of **show run | include **accept-dialin**** indicates that L2TP LNS termination is enabled.      The following is the output of the **show run | include** **accept-dialin** on Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured as an L2TP Network Server (LNS): ```   asr1004#sho running-config | include accept-dialinaccept-dialin      ``` To verify if xconnect is enabled on a device use the **show run | include xconnect|l2tpv3** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **encapsulation l2tpv3** and **xconnect** in the output of **show run | include xconnect|l2tpv3** indicates that xconnect is enabled.      The following is the output of the **show run | include xconnect|l2tpv3** on Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured for xconnect:    ```   asr1004#sho running-config | include xconnect|l2tpv3encapsulation l2tpv3   xconnect 10.0.0.1 1000 encapsulation l2tpv3 pw-class my_class   ```       **Note**: Cisco IOS devices configured with L2TPv3 Ethernet Pseudowire (xconnect) or as L2TP LNS are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.            **Cisco IOS XE Software Bridge Domain Interface Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload during the processing of packets when the bridge domain interface (BDI) feature is configured.      Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions are satisfied:     + The physical interface that processes the packet on the ingress path is the layer 3 interface that has the encapsulation type set to untagged.   + The incoming packet is routed through a BDI interface.   + The egress physical interface of the packet has the encapsulation set to rewrite VLAN.**Note:** The BDI feature is not configured by default.      To verify if the above conditions are satisfied on a device use the **show run | section interface** privileged EXEC command. The following is the output of **show run | section interface** in Cisco IOS XE software on a device configured with the vulnerable BDI setting:   ```   	asr1004#sho running-config | section interface   	interface GigabitEthernet0/0/3        ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0        !           interface BDI20           ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0   	!        interface GigabitEthernet0/0/4           no ip address           negotiation auto           service instance 1 ethernet           encapsulation dot1q 201           rewrite egress tag pop 1 symmetric           bridge-domain 20    ```   **Note:** This feature was introduced on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers in Cisco IOS XE Software version 3.2.0S.      **Note**: Cisco IOS devices configured for BDI are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.         **Cisco IOS XE Software SIP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets that undergo Network Address Translation (NAT) within Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance and SIP Application Layer Gateway (ALG) inspection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of SIP packets traversing a device configured for NAT.      Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability if VRF-aware NAT and SIP ALG is enabled on an affected device; these services are not enabled by default.      SIP ALG is enabled on a device as soon as NAT is enabled. Administrators can choose to disable SIP ALG inspection under NAT configuration.       SIP ALG can also be enabled under Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) configuration. Devices configured for SIP ALG under ZBFW are not affected by this vulnerability.      To determine whether VRF-aware NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, either **ip nat inside** or **ip nat outside** commands must be present in different interfaces, and at least one **ip nat** global configuration command must have a **vrf** keyword.       The **show running-config | include ip (nat | .\* vrf .\*)** command can be used to determine whether VRF-aware NAT is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:    ```   asr1004#show running-config | include ip (nat | .* vrf .*) ip nat inside ip nat outside ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1 vrf VRF-SIP     ```  If the output is empty, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on a given device is not vulnerable. If the output returned is not empty, SIP ALG services may be explicitly disabled under NAT configuration. To determine whether SIP ALG is disabled under NAT configuration, use the **show run | include ip nat** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **no ip nat service sip** in the output of **show run | include ip nat** indicates that SIP ALG is disabled under NAT configuration.      The following is the output of **show run | include ip nat** in Cisco IOS XE Software that has the SIP ALG disabled under NAT configuration:    ```         asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat       ip nat inside       ip nat outside       ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1 vrf sip       no ip nat service sip udp port 5060       no ip nat service sip tcp port 5060    ```   If **no ip nat service sip** is not present in the output of **show run | include ip nat**, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on the device is vulnerable.       **Note**: Cisco IOS devices configured for SIP ALG inspection are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.      Determine the Running Software VersionCisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS XE Software releases correspond to the Cisco IOS Software releases. For example, Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.6.2S is the software release for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS Software Release 15.2(2)S2.   For more information about mappings between the Cisco IOS XE Software releases and their associated Cisco IOS Software releases, see:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_intro.html>   To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS XE Software is running on a device, administrators can issue the **show version** command. The following example shows a Cisco IOS XE Software that is running IOS XE software version 3.6.2S, IOS version 15.2(2)S2:    ```   asr1004#show version Cisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.2(2)S2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2012 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Tue 07-Aug-12 13:40 by mcpre   ```    **Note**: A Cisco IOS XE Software image consists of seven individual modules, also referred to as subpackages. The packages are designed to use the In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) capability of the Cisco IOS XE Software. Customers have the capability to upgrade only those packages that need to be upgraded. For more information about the Cisco IOS XE Software packaging, see:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/partner/prod/collateral/routers/ps9343/product_bulletin_c25-448387.html>      If packages are upgraded individually, the output of the **show version** command mayvary.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableProducts running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS-XR Software are not affected by any of these vulnerabilities.      With the exception of the Cisco IOS XE Software for 1000 Series ASR, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.
