# Security Advisory 1302

```

Summary           : Buffer Overflow in ASF Demuxer
Date              : January 2013
Affected versions : VLC media player 2.0.5 and earlier
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-1302
CVE reference     : CVE-2013-1954

```
## Details

When parsing a specially crafted ASF movie, a buffer overflow might occur.

## Impact

If successful, a malicious third party could trigger an invalid memory access, leading to
a crash of VLC media player's process. In some cases attackers might exploit this issue
to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application but this information is not confirmed.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of this issue requires the user to explicitly open a specially crafted ASF movie.

## Workarounds

The user should refrain from opening files from untrusted third parties or accessing untrusted
remote sites (or disable the VLC browser plugins), until the patch is applied.

Alternatively, the ASF demuxer (`libasf_plugin.*`) can be removed manually
from the VLC plugin installation directory. This will prevent ASF movie playback.

## Solution

This issue is addressed in VLC media player 2.0.x source code repository by replacing a
macro with a static inline and improved bounds checking.

This patch is included in VLC's 2.0.6 release.

Windows and Mac OS X builds can be found on the VideoLAN nightlies website.

## Credits

This vulnerability was reported by Debasish Mandal.

Hi Kurt

I have not found a CVE assigned for the following issue already (note
upstream advisory also has only a CVE reference reference marked):

VLC Security Advisory 1302 is about Buffer Overflow in ASF Demuxer:

<http://www.videolan.org/security/sa1302.html>

With upstream git commit:

<http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=commitdiff;h=b31ce523331aa3a6e620b68cdfe3f161d519631e>

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue (in case it's not yet in progress)
to better track the issue?

Regards,
Salvatore

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
