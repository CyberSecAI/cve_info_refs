  "CVE-2013-1629": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Cve Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Bugzilla": {
      "Root cause": "pip, a package installer for Python modules, would retrieve code to install in an insecure manner. When pip is used to install a module, that code is retrieved from the internet and then, in the presence of setup.py, is executed. If pip is used as root, then this code is executed with root permissions. Because pip did not do TLS certificate verification, or package verification, it was trivial for an attacker to perform a MitM attack and cause the user attempting to install a module to execute arbitrary code. ",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Insecure installation mechanism",
        "Lack of TLS certificate verification",
        "Lack of package verification",
        "Man-in-the-middle vulnerability"
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with root privileges.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attacks"
      ],
     "Attacker capabilities": "Ability to intercept network traffic"
    },
    "GitHub_Pull_Request_791": {
      "Root cause": "The pull request addresses the lack of SSL certificate verification in pip when downloading packages over HTTPS, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
       "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of SSL certificate verification",
        "Man-in-the-middle vulnerability"
      ],
       "Impact": "Addresses the insecure download process.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attacks"
      ],
     "Attacker capabilities": "Ability to intercept network traffic"
    },
     "Reddit_Post": {
     "Root cause": "pip downloads packages over plain HTTP, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Although pip performs an MD5 checksum, this doesn't prevent MitM attacks because checksums are also transmitted over the insecure channel. Pip executes setup.py from the downloaded package, giving root access to anyone who can intercept the connection, which can happen easily on an untrusted network.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Insecure download process",
        "Lack of TLS certificate verification",
        "Man-in-the-middle vulnerability"

       "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with root privileges via a man-in-the-middle attack.",

      ],
      "Attacker capabilities": "Ability to intercept network traffic"
    },
    "pip_changelog":{
        "Root cause": "The changelog entries indicate that pip versions prior to 1.3 did not use SSL for downloading packages, making users vulnerable to security threats.",
          "Weaknesses": [
           "Lack of SSL certificate verification"
