Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1050:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2013-1050. The bug report ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screensaver/+bug/1120126](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screensaver/+bug/1120126)) explicitly mentions "This is CVE-2013-1050" and the fix commits also reference it. The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-1716-1) also confirms that the vulnerability was addressed in gnome-screensaver and references CVE-2013-1050.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in an incorrect `AutostartCondition` within the `gnome-screensaver.desktop` file. This condition prevented `gnome-screensaver` from automatically starting in Unity sessions. The line `AutostartCondition=GNOME3 if-session gnome-fallback` caused the screensaver to not start in Unity, as it was not considered a `gnome-fallback` session.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect Autostart Condition:** The primary weakness was the faulty `AutostartCondition` that failed to recognize Unity sessions as compatible for auto-starting `gnome-screensaver`.
-   **Lack of Fallback:**  When the gnome-shell couldn't use it's own integrated locking mechanism (which depends on GDM), it did not reliably fallback to using `gnome-screensaver`.
-   **Inconsistent State:** Without a properly running screensaver, the screen would blank after the idle timeout but not lock, leaving the session accessible to anyone with physical access.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unintended Access:** An attacker with physical access to a machine could gain access to an unlocked user session if the user had left the computer idle.
-   **Bypass Screen Lock:** The screen would blank but not lock, which means that an attacker could simply move the mouse or press a key to regain access.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector was physical access to the vulnerable machine after a period of inactivity.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker needs to be physically present at the machine where the vulnerability exists.
-   **No User Interaction Required:** The attacker doesn't need to trick the user into taking any actions. The system is vulnerable after a period of inactivity when the screen blanks.

**Additional Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

-   **GDM dependency**: The vulnerability was related to gnome-shell's dependency on the GDM (GNOME Display Manager) for screen locking. When GDM wasn't running (e.g., when using LightDM, KDM or startx), the gnome-shell lock screen would fail.
-   **Fallback mechanism**:  The fix involved a few parts. The most notable were:
    -   Changing the autostart condition so that the gnome-screensaver is automatically started in Unity sessions.
    -   Ensuring the gnome-shell fell back to using `gnome-screensaver` when GDM isn't available or is not working.
-   **Mitigation**:  The vulnerability was resolved by updating the `gnome-screensaver` package to version `3.6.0-0ubuntu2.1` in Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal) and to version `3.6.1-0ubuntu3` in later releases (Raring).

In summary, CVE-2013-1050 was caused by a faulty autostart condition which prevented `gnome-screensaver` from starting automatically which then led to the screen not being locked upon timeout. This allowed an attacker with physical access to bypass the screen lock and access the user session.
