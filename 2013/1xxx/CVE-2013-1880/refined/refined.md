  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The portfolioPublish servlet in Apache ActiveMQ's demo web application does not sanitize user input, specifically the 'refresh' parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"

    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the affected page, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can inject malicious code through the 'refresh' parameter of the `portfolioPublish` servlet URL.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires no authentication and can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL, which, when visited by a user, will execute the injected script."
