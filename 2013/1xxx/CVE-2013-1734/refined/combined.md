| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

Use [CVE-2013-1734](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-1734)
Why sec-critical? This isn't compromising bugzilla in general. Beyond vandalism what's the worst you could do here? Luring a privileged user to un-hide an attachment maybe, revealing a security bug? My initial feel was moderate, but given hidden attachments I could live with sec-high.Alias: CVE-2013-1734Keywords: [sec-critical](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-critical&resolution=---) â†’ [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

# 4.4.1, 4.2.7, and 4.0.11 Security Advisory

Wednesday, Oct 16th, 2013
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A CSRF vulnerability in process_bug.cgi affecting Bugzilla 4.4 only
  can lead to a bug being edited without the user consent.

* A CSRF vulnerability in attachment.cgi can lead to an attachment
  being edited without the user consent.

* Several unfiltered parameters when editing flagtypes can lead to XSS.

* Due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-4189, some incorrectly filtered
  field values in tabular reports can lead to XSS.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    4.4rc1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.4.1
Description: When a user submits changes to a bug right after another
             user did, a midair collision page is displayed to inform
             the user about changes recently made. This page contains
             a token which can be used to validate the changes if the
             user decides to submit his changes anyway. A regression
             in Bugzilla 4.4 caused this token to be recreated if a
             crafted URL was given, even when no midair collision page
             was going to be displayed, allowing an attacker to bypass
             the token check and abuse a user to commit changes on his
             behalf.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=911593
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1733

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    2.16rc1 to 4.0.10, 4.1.1 to 4.2.6, 4.3.1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.0.11, 4.2.7, 4.4.1
Description: When an attachment is edited, a token is generated to
             validate changes made by the user. Using a crafted URL,
             an attacker could force the token to be recreated,
             allowing him to bypass the token check and abuse a user
             to commit changes on his behalf.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=913904
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1734

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.1 to 4.0.10, 4.1.1 to 4.2.6, 4.3.1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.0.11, 4.2.7, 4.4.1
Description: Some parameters passed to editflagtypes.cgi were not
             correctly filtered in the HTML page, which could lead
             to XSS.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=924802
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1742

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    4.1.1 to 4.2.6, 4.3.1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.2.7, 4.4.1
Description: Due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-4189, some
             incorrectly filtered field values in tabular reports
             could lead to XSS.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=924932
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1743

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
