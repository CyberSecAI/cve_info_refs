Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1285:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of objects in memory by Windows USB drivers. Specifically, the issue occurs when processing USB descriptors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Memory Handling:** The core issue is that the Windows kernel-mode driver does not correctly handle objects in memory when dealing with USB device descriptors. This can lead to memory corruption, allowing an attacker to overwrite kernel memory.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** This vulnerability allows for elevation of privilege, which means an attacker could escalate their privileges to a higher level, such as kernel level.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Full System Control:** Gaining kernel-level access enables the attacker to:
    *   Install programs
    *   View, change, or delete data
    *   Create new accounts with full administrative rights
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Ultimately, this vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious USB Device:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker inserting a specially crafted malicious USB device into a vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** In a default configuration, the attacker needs physical access to the system to plug in the malicious USB device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects various versions of Windows, including XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, 7, Server 2008 R2, 8, and Server 2012.
*   The provided documents also discuss two additional related vulnerabilities, CVE-2013-1286 and CVE-2013-1287, which share the same root cause and attack vector.
*   Workarounds involve disabling USB RNDIS devices via registry changes or by modifying file system permissions to prevent the installation of malicious USB devices. These workarounds may affect the usability of legitimate USB RNDIS devices.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security bulletin.

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-1285 is a critical elevation of privilege vulnerability caused by improper memory handling in Windows USB drivers. It can be exploited by physically inserting a malicious USB device, potentially leading to full system compromise.
