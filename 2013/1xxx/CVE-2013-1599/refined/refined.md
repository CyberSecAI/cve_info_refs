Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described under CVE-2013-1599:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `rtpd.cgi` script of D-Link IP cameras.
- The script uses the `eval` function on the `QUERY_STRING` after replacing ampersands with spaces.
- There is insufficient sanitization of the input before passing it to `eval`, allowing command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection [CWE-78]:**  The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary operating system commands.
- Lack of input sanitization: The script attempts to prevent spaces in the `QUERY_STRING`, but this check is bypassed by using ampersands instead, which are then replaced with spaces before being passed to `eval`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the vulnerable device.
- **Full system access** Because the code is executed with the privileges of the webserver user, full access to the device might be possible depending on how the user permissions are set up.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** A malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `rtpd.cgi` script on the web interface can trigger the command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the device's web interface. No prior authentication is required.
- Ability to send HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability stems from the following code snippet in `rtpd.cgi`:
  ```
  echo "$QUERY_STRING" | grep -vq ' ' || die "query string cannot contain spaces."
  . $conf > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
  eval "$(echo $QUERY_STRING | sed -e 's/&/ /g')"
  ```
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted request like this:
  ```
  http://<camera_ip>/cgi-bin/rtpd.cgi?uname&-a;cat&/etc/passwd
  ```
  This would execute the `uname -a; cat /etc/passwd` command on the camera's OS.
