Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-1937:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the phpMyAdmin application. Specifically, the `visualizationSettings['width']` and `visualizationSettings['height']` parameters in the `tbl_gis_visualization.php` file are directly outputted into the HTML code without any form of encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, meaning that malicious scripts injected via URL parameters are immediately reflected back in the web page's HTML.
- **Unescaped HTML Output:** The root cause of the XSS is the direct output of user-controlled data into the HTML without escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL.
- **Potential Account Compromise:** Although difficult due to the token protection, in a hypothetical scenario where an attacker could predict the token, they could potentially perform actions as the victim user by exploiting the XSS to make requests that the victim's browser will execute.
- **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** With JavaScript execution, an attacker could potentially steal cookies, modify page content, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
- **Database Compromise:** In a hypothetical scenario where the attacker could predict the token and also bypass the protections on the `secure_file_privs` MySQL variable, it would be possible to write files on the server's filesystem, leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URLs:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing the XSS payload within the `visualizationSettings` parameters, which can be delivered by methods like phishing, or social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `width` and `height` parameters in `tbl_gis_visualization.php`.
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker must be able to create malicious URLs with embedded JavaScript code and entice a user to click on it.
- **Valid User Session:** The vulnerability requires a logged-in user session. However, the provided research also indicates that this XSS cannot be exploited remotely, because the token required for the vulnerable requests cannot be predicted by the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided research confirms that the `PMA_token` parameter works as an Anti-CSRF token and that it's not predictable.
- The `secure_file_privs` variable in MySQL is usually set to a directory outside the web server's root directory, preventing attackers from using the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` to create a web shell, although a misconfiguration could expose the server to this risk.
- Although user creation is possible, the user needs to be authenticated with a high-privilege account, otherwise a standard user will not be able to grant all privileges to a new user.

**Mitigation:**
-  The vulnerability is resolved in phpMyAdmin version 3.5.8 and later by using `htmlspecialchars` to sanitize the width and height parameters.
