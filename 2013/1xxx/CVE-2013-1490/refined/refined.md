Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of two new security vulnerabilities (identified as issue 51 and issue 52) within the Java SE 7 code. These vulnerabilities were discovered by Security Explorations and reported to Oracle.  The content also notes that the emergency patch released by Oracle to address a previous vulnerability was incomplete, leaving Java users still exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Two distinct security vulnerabilities (issue 51 and 52) are present in Java SE 7.
-  Issue 51 affects both Java SE 6 and 7 while Issue 52 affects only Java SE 7.
-  The combination of both issues is required for successful exploitation, so the vulnerability is primarily associated with Java 7.
-  The previous patch for the earlier vulnerability was incomplete.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerabilities allow for a "complete Java security sandbox bypass."
- Attackers can potentially install malware on end-user computers by exploiting these flaws.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious Java applets and using social engineering to get users to approve their execution, or using a stolen valid code signing certificate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through malicious Java applets embedded in websites.
- Attackers need to get the user to either allow the applet to run or use a valid stolen certificate.
- By browsing to a malicious website, a user could become vulnerable

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft malicious Java applets that exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
- Ability to host these applets on a website (or inject into legitimate websites)
- Capability to employ social engineering tactics to trick users into allowing the malicious applet to run or to obtain a stolen valid certificate.
- Knowledge of the newly discovered vulnerabilities

**Additional Details**
- While Java 7 Update 11 introduced a security protection that blocks unsigned applets, this can be bypassed with social engineering or stolen certificates.
- One of the vulnerabilities affects both Java 6 and 7, but the combination of the two issues was needed to achieve the sandbox bypass, limiting it to Java 7.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description as it provides specifics on the vulnerability research, the attack vector, and the required attacker capabilities.
