{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The mod_dav_svn module in Subversion did not validate if the username was set before attempting to copy it into revision properties during a LOCK request against a non-existent URL when auto-versioning is enabled and the client is not a standard SVN DAV client.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference due to missing username validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The server's HTTPD process crashes, denying service to legitimate users.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted LOCK request against a non-existent URL."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Subversion server. The attack can be triggered remotely if authentication is not required or if auto-versioning and non-SVN DAV clients are enabled."
