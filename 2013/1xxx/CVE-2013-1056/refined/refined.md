Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1056:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from non-root X.Org X servers (like Xephyr) incorrectly using cached xkb files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of cached xkb files by non-root X servers.
- Use of shared cached files without proper isolation/validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local attacker could cause an xkb cache file to be loaded by another user.
- This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attacker access is required.
- The attacker needs to manipulate or influence the xkb cache file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user access on the system.
- Ability to influence the cached xkb files used by other users.
- Needs to be on a system where non-root X servers like Xephyr are running.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability described in the provided text is a local privilege escalation that leads to a denial of service (DoS) through the use of cached keyboard layouts (xkb files). It highlights a flaw in how non-root X servers handle shared cache files and it is not a privilege escalation to root, but an unintended sharing of files between users. This is more specific than the generic CVE description for the vulnerability which is a good thing.
