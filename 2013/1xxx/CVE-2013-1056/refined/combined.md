# USN-1990-1: X.Org X server vulnerabilities

17 October 2013

The X.Org X server could be made to crash or run programs as an
administrator if it received specially crafted input.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [xorg-server](/security/cves?package=xorg-server) - X.Org X11 server
* [xorg-server-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=xorg-server-lts-quantal) - X.Org X11 server
* [xorg-server-lts-raring](/security/cves?package=xorg-server-lts-raring) - X.Org X11 server

## Details

Pedro Ribeiro discovered that the X.Org X server incorrectly handled

memory operations when handling ImageText requests. An attacker could use

this issue to cause X.Org to crash, or to possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2013-4396](/security/CVE-2013-4396))

It was discovered that non-root X.Org X servers such as Xephyr incorrectly

used cached xkb files. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a xkb

cache file to be loaded by another user, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2013-1056](/security/CVE-2013-1056))
