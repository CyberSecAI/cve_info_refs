{
  "Root cause": "An out-of-bounds memory read/write flaw exists in the Mesa library, specifically within the Intel graphics drivers.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to crash an application linked against Mesa, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Exploiting the Mesa API with untrusted input, such as through a browser using WebGL or by injecting 3D models.",
     "Malicious X server sending unvalidated messages"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious input or by controlling the X server."
