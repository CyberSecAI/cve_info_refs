Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1362:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) did not properly filter metacharacters when the `dont_blame_nrpe` configuration option was enabled. Specifically, the filtering in `src/nrpe.c`  excluded `$()` which allows command substitution in bash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** NRPE's attempt to sanitize command arguments was incomplete. It blocked some metacharacters but missed `$()`.
*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands via the NRPE command arguments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary shell commands on the target system with the privileges of the NRPE service (typically 'nagios').
*   **System Compromise:** This could potentially lead to full system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network via the NRPE protocol.
*   **NRPE Command Arguments:** The attacker injects malicious commands within the arguments of an NRPE command that is configured to allow arguments via the `dont_blame_nrpe` setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target system running the vulnerable NRPE service.
*   **NRPE Command Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know a NRPE command that is configured to accept arguments (via `dont_blame_nrpe`).
*   **Command Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious command using bash command substitution `$()`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects NRPE versions prior to 2.14.
*   The Metasploit module provided in the exploit-db content demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability to achieve remote command execution.
*   The provided opensuse mailing list entries confirm the vulnerability and the availability of updates/patches to address it.
* The exploit uses a combination of shell commands including `sed`, `base64`, and `eval` to execute the attacker's payload after writing it to a temporary file on the target.
