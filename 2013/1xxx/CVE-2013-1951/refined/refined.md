Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of Lua function names used in MediaWiki's Scribunto extension. Specifically, the function names are included in the "NewPP limit report" which is embedded as an HTML comment within the page source. Due to the lack of proper sanitization, specially crafted Lua function names can be used to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where a malicious actor can inject client-side scripts into the HTML output.
- **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an HTML Comment:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled data (Lua function names) that is included in an HTML comment, leading to the possibility of breaking out of the comment and injecting arbitrary HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user viewing the affected page. This can lead to a range of malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites.
    - Defacing web pages.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Lua Function Names:** The attacker crafts a Lua function name that includes malicious HTML or JavaScript code. This function name is then invoked by using the Scribunto extension.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a page that includes content (via Scribunto) with a specially crafted Lua function name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **MediaWiki Account:** The attacker needs a MediaWiki account with the ability to create or edit Lua modules.
- **Knowledge of Scribunto:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the Scribunto extension and how to inject malicious code through it.
- **Target Interaction:** The attacker relies on other users visiting pages where the crafted Lua module output is rendered.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in MediaWiki versions 1.19.5 and 1.20.4.
- The fix involved sanitizing the output of the "NewPP limit report" to prevent script injection.
- The issue was assigned CVE-2013-1951, although other related vulnerabilities, such as XXE issues, were discovered in the same MediaWiki releases.
- The injected code was included in HTML comment tags, which can still be abused by malicious HTML injection techniques.
