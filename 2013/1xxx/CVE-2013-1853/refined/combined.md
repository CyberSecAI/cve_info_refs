| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=920848#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-12 21:46:40 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that Almanah does not encrypt its database when it closes, due to GApplication no longer using the quit_main_loop() event since GIO 2.32.  This will keep the database unencrypted when it should be encrypted.  The upstream bug report has a patch attached which corrects the issue.

Subject: almanah: Almanah doesn't encrypt the database
Date: Tue, 12 Mar 2013 20:28:19 +0100
```
Package: almanah
Version: 0.9.0-2
Severity: grave
Tags: security upstream
Justification: user security hole

Dear Maintainer,
GApplication doesn't use "quit_mainloop" event since GIO 2.32[1], so Almanah
doesn't encrypt the database[2] when the user close the application.

Cheers,

Hi Angel

Disclaimer: not part of the release team but noticed #702911 as the
corresponding #702905 in almanah fixes a security bug.

It looks that your unblock request never went trough the list, as the
debdiff is quite big. At this stage of the release the release team
will probably not acknowledge this unblock request.

I did only a short test: this looks also to a regression from Squeeze,
as in Squeeze it is possible to have a diary encrypted. But upgrading
to wheezy then the diary.db does not get encrypted after closing.

Regards,
Salvatore

I took a look the patch, and it seems only the very last part (which changes
the code) is actually needed. I created a patch for a TPU version with only
this change and did some basic testing. With this patch, the db is encrypted.

Obviously. But that seems more likely than a review of the diff between the
versions in wheeze and sid.

Cheers,

Ivo

It looks like Julien unblocked it yesterday, and it's already migrated.
