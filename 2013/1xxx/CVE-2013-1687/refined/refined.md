Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to compile a user-defined function within the XBL scope of a specific element in Mozilla Firefox and related products (Thunderbird, SeaMonkey). By triggering an event within this scope, the compiled code could be executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **System Only Wrapper (SOW) Bypass:** The executed code could access content protected by SOW, which are intended to restrict access to certain resources.
2.  **Chrome-Privileged Page Access:** The code could also access chrome-privileged pages, which have higher levels of access within the browser.
3.  **Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) Bypass:** Web content could bypass COW restrictions to access privileged methods, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) from privileged pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the affected application (Firefox, Thunderbird, etc.).
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The COW bypass could lead to XSS attacks, potentially allowing malicious web pages to steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the user.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: By bypassing security wrappers and accessing privileged methods, an attacker can escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Specially Crafted Web Content:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious web page that takes advantage of the vulnerability.
2.  **User Interaction:** The user would need to interact with or load the malicious content, such as visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious HTML file, although the description notes that Thunderbird has scripting disabled for email messages by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Ability to Craft Malicious Web Content:** The attacker needs the ability to create web content that exploits the XBL and COW bypasses.
2.  **User Action:** The attacker needs to entice a user to interact with the crafted content.
3. **Understanding of XBL, SOW, and COW**: The attacker needs an understanding of how to abuse the system to achieve their malicious goals.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Mariusz Mlynski.
*   The vulnerability affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and Thunderbird ESR.
*   The fix involves updating the affected applications to versions that include the patch, such as Firefox 22, Firefox ESR 17.0.7, SeaMonkey 2.19, Thunderbird 17.0.7, and Thunderbird ESR 17.0.7.
* The provided content mentions that while these vulnerabilities can affect Thunderbird, the risk is primarily related to browsing contexts since scripting is disabled in email messages.
*   Red Hat's security advisory noted that the issues are present in Thunderbird when displaying full remote content of an RSS feed.
