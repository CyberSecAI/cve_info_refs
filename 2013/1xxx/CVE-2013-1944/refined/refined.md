  "CVE-2013-1944": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way libcurl matched domains associated with cookies. This could lead to cURL or an application linked against libcurl sending the wrong cookie if only part of the domain name matched the domain associated with the cookie, disclosing the cookie to unrelated hosts.",
    "affected_components": [
      "libcurl",
      "curl"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `tailMatch` function in `cookie.c` of cURL and libcurl uses an improper method of matching domain names for cookies. It does not perform a strict match, leading to cookies being sent to unintended domains if the host domain contains the cookie domain as a suffix.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cookie Disclosure",
       "Incorrect cookie domain matching"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially hijack user sessions by sending requests to a specially crafted domain, causing the victim's browser or application to send the wrong cookies, leading to unauthorized access or impersonation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
        "specially crafted URL"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to register domains that can cause a suffix match of legitimate domains to exploit this issue, and trick a user or an automated system to process the specially crafted URL.",
