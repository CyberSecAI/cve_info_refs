{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The pip package manager downloads packages over plain HTTP, without verifying the server certificate, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure HTTP protocol usage for package downloads.",
      "Lack of SSL/TLS certificate verification.",
      "Reliance on MD5 checksums which are insufficient when the transport is not secure."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can intercept the package download and inject malicious code into the `setup.py` file. When the user installs the manipulated package, the attacker can gain root access to the user's machine because pip often runs `setup.py` as root.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the network used to download packages."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept network traffic between the user's machine and the PyPi server (e.g., by controlling a network device or by ARP spoofing on a local network).",
       "Ability to modify the downloaded package data in transit.",
       "Basic understanding of Python package structure and how `setup.py` works."
