# QuiXplorer -- VERSION HISTORY & RELEASE NOTES

### Version 2.5.5 2013-11-03

* Bugfix: Global $no\_access pattern was ignored while listing
* Updated to uploadify version 3.2. Now uploadify
  works under Linux as well.
* Found limitation that uploads with uploadify
  do only work as long as the logged in user
  has the same home directory as configured in
  the \_config/conf.php.
* Introduced a new uploader.php that allows you
  to control where and when the files are
  stored when uploaded with uploadify.
* Uploadify prevents uploading files that matches
  the global $no\_access pattern in the \_config/conf.php.
* Added additional uploader "ajaxupload" which
  also works under https connections.

  YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR CONFIGURATION FILE!

  The setting "use\_uploadify" has been replaced
  by the setting "uploader", which takes now
  a string. See the configuration template file
  \_config/conf.php.template for any details.

  files feature

3. download the new version of Quixplorer and install it into
   your installation directory

   directory

* You may now configure the page title and the login prompt message
  within your config file.

#### Upgrade notice:

Version 2.3.2 should be compatible to the other versions. However,
you may want to use the template of the new config file (.config/conf.php)
to use configure the site name and login prompt message in this place.

These may reduce upgrading efforts if you changed this values for the future.

## News

### Version 2.5.8 released

This version fixes some encoding issues with different language files and the
mim-type bug. Thanks to all contributors!

### Version 2.5.7 released

This version fixes a bug that disabled the "password change" function and a bug
which evaluated the wrong directory variable when checking wether a download
is allowed.

Furthermore, all language files have been converted to utf-8.

### Version 2.5.6 released

After releasing version 2.5.5 fixing a vulnerability issue (thanks to
trustwave.com for finding it), i still found to bugs regarding the
logon procedure and listing symbilic links which have been fixed in this 2.5.6
version.

As long as you don't complain, i would consider this version as
quite "stable".

Thanks again to all contributors.

### Testing extended

Because of testing makes that much fun, we finally improved our tests,
found and fixed some minor bugs and added some tests for the
[login procedure](/realtimeprojects/quixplorer/blob/master/test/features/system/004-login2.feature) and the
[list procedure](/realtimeprojects/quixplorer/blob/master/test/features/system/005-list.feature).

### About radish BDD testing

With version 2.5.5 we included some automated testing
using the BDD test tool [radish](https://github.com/timofurrer/radish/).

Currently we only have some automated tests for the 'download multiple files' feature.

For more detailed information, see [doc/testing.md](/realtimeprojects/quixplorer/blob/master/doc/testing.md).

### Version 2.5.5 released

A vulnerability issue with quixplorer motivated my to make
another official release of 'quixplorer' with a bugfix.

This release contains some other improvements and bugfixes found
by some people out there. Thanks for that.

Checkout the version from: <https://github.com/realtimeprojects/quixplorer/tree/v2.5.5>

### Version 2.5.4 released

This version contains several bugfixes introduced by previous versions,
thanks to all the people assisted in debugging.

Checkout the version from: <https://github.com/realtimeprojects/quixplorer/tree/v2.5.4>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
