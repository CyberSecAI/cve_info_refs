{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2013-1641",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability was due to improper handling of file paths when creating a zip archive for download, which allowed users to download arbitrary files on the server.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path traversal vulnerability",
        "Insufficient access control"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could download any file readable by the web server process, potentially including sensitive configuration files, private keys, or user data.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to download multiple files or a directory as a zip archive. An attacker could manipulate the file paths included in the request to download unauthorized files.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to exploit the vulnerability."
    },
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2013-1641",
      "root_cause": "The download functionality did not properly sanitize the file paths when creating a zip archive, leading to the possibility of accessing files outside the intended directory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure file handling",
         "Path traversal vulnerability",
         "Insufficient validation of file paths"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker could potentially gain access to any file on the server that the web server process has access to by manipulating the file paths when downloading as zip.",
       "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the download functionality, specifically when downloading multiple files or a directory as a zip archive.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application."
