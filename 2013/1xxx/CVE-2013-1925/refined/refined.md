{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CTools module does not sufficiently enforce node access when providing an autocomplete list of suggested node titles.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Access bypass vulnerability due to insufficient node access enforcement.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Users with the 'access content' permission can see the titles of nodes they should not be able to view.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote exploitation via the autocomplete list of suggested node titles.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have 'access content' permission."
