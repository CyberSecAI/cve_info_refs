- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `apache2ctl` script created the lock directory in an unsafe manner.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unsafe creation of lock directory leading to a symlink vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can gain elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation using a symlink attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the system.
