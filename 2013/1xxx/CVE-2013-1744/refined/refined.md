Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of user-controlled input within the `downloadPDF` function of the I Read It Somewhere (IRIS) application. Specifically, the `$url` variable, partially constructed using user-provided data from the `code` parameter, is directly incorporated into a `wget` command that is then executed using `shell_exec`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** The most significant weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the application. This is due to the direct inclusion of a user-controlled `$url` variable into a shell command without sanitization or validation.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-provided `code` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious code through it.
*   **Insecure use of shell_exec():** The `shell_exec()` function is used to execute an OS command with user supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker could gain complete control over the server by executing arbitrary commands.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could steal sensitive data stored on the server or use it to pivot to other systems.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can render the application or server unavailable.
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers could install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `p`, `import` and `code` GET parameters to control the `url` variable within the `downloadPDF()` function.
*   Specifically by setting `p=add` and `import=spnro` and inserting shell command in the `code` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable IRIS application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct HTTP GET requests to include the malicious payload through the URL parameters.
