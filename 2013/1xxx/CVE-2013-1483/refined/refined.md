Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1483:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The provided documents indicate a vulnerability in the JavaFX component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The specific nature of this vulnerability is not detailed in these documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary vulnerability is in the JavaFX component, allowing for remote exploitation.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited through untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets, as mentioned in the Oracle advisory.
*   The vulnerability is present in JavaFX 2.2.4 and earlier versions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
*   The attacker gains the same privileges as the user running the Java application or applet.
*   The CVSS score is 10.0, indicating a high severity vulnerability, with potential for complete impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attacks:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over a network.
*   **Web Browsers:** The vulnerability can be exploited through malicious Java applets embedded in web pages, or through malicious Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) files.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers may use social engineering to trick users into visiting malicious web pages or opening malicious JNLP files.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers may compromise legitimate websites to host malicious Java applets, leading to "drive-by download" attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated access:**  No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to serve malicious content:** The attacker needs a way to serve malicious Java applets or JNLP files to the target user, typically through web servers or compromised websites.
*   **User interaction**: The user needs to visit the malicious website or open the malicious JNLP file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Oracle advisory notes that this vulnerability, along with others, prompted an accelerated release of the critical patch update due to active exploitation in the wild.
*   The CERT vulnerability note highlights that applications using Internet Explorer web content rendering components (e.g., Microsoft Office, Windows Desktop Search) could also be attack vectors.
*   The provided information confirms that multiple versions of Java SE (1.4.2, 5.0, 6, and 7) and JavaFX are affected.

**Mitigation:**

* The documents recommend updating Java to the patched versions, disabling Java in web browsers, and restricting access to Java applets as mitigation measures.
