# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-83

## Mozilla Updater does not lock MAR file after signature verification

Announced
September 17, 2013
Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 24
* Firefox ESR 17.0.9
* SeaMonkey 2.21
* Thunderbird 24
* Thunderbird ESR 17.0.9

### Description

Security researcher **Seb Patane** reported that the Mozilla
Updater does not write-lock the MAR update file when it is in use by the
Updater. This leaves open the possibility of altering the contents of the MAR
file after the signature on the file has been verified as valid but before it
has been used. This could allow an attacker with access to the local system to
silently replace the contents of the update MAR file and either replace the
installed software with their own or extract and run executables files with the
same privileges as that of the Mozilla Updater.

### References

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

The updater doesn't write-lock the user-supplied MAR file while it is using it. This leads to a race condition between the MAR file's signatures being validated and the actual access of data within the file.
If an attacker can change the file after the MAR signatures are validated, but before data is read, the attacker supplied MAR data will be what the updater uses. The proof-of-concept uses this to replace the version string which allows us to downgrade Firefox to a vulnerable version (at which point an attacker could use a previous vulnerability such as #888314 to execute arbitrary code).
I'd imagine with further investigation into the MAR file format an attacker could feasibly have the updater extract and run their own files as part of the update process as well. This all runs as the SYSTEM user.
Proof-of-concept is attached. It expects the current directory to hold an update.original.mar file (tested with <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/20.0/update/win32/en-GB/firefox-20.0.complete.mar>), which it will use to downgrade the Firefox installation in c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\.
As with race conditions, timing can be a little finicky. On my PC (Win7 x64, updater.exe 22.0.0.4917) I find there's a 200ms window between ~250-450ms. Given no arguments, the PoC will start at 200ms and work its way up to 1000ms in 10ms increments until it succeeds.

We did take special care to make sure the MAR file was opened before verifying its signature and using it, without closing it in between.
Unfortunately it looks like mar\_open maps to \_wfopen which allows file sharing rights by default. see:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/modules/libmar/src/mar_read.c#181>
We can simply change this to use \_wfopen\_s and the problem should be fixed.
\_wfopen\_s doesn't allow any file sharing rights.
i.e. \_wfopen uses CreateFile's FILE\_SHARE\_READ | FILE\_SHARE\_WRITE | FILE\_SHARE\_DELETE
\_wfopen\_s uses none of those flags.
VS2005's SDK's CRT and above supports it so I think we can use it.
Note: the new code that was added which protects replacing updater.exe uses CreateFile directly so doesn't specify the sharing flags. The mar\_open code predates the maintenance service, but we haven't verified signatures until the same time.
Also note that this problem is equally a problem without the maintenance service since we verify signatures on the MAR file without the maintenance service as well. It just landed close to the maintenance service.

Patch v1.
There is no security rating yet so I thought I'd request sec-approval just in case.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
There is one attache to this bug, somewhat easily but you need physical access to the machine.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I don't think it's very well known that \_wfopen\_s doesn't allow sharing but \_wfopen does, so I don't think it points a bulls-eye on the problem.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All, it's worth noting that old versions of Firefox before the maintenance service didn't even try to protect against spoofed MAR files. So we lived with this in the past.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 699700](/show_bug.cgi?id=699700 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add support for signing and verifying MAR files in libmar and the mar program") but we didn't have MAR verification at all before that.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The patches should be the same.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Low, I'll be pushing to oak first to manually test.

Adding release management before sec-approval as we'll need to take this on ESR, where it is more of a concern.
Dan pointed out that the only diff in the patch is a change to a \_s version of an api that was created as a \_s variant specifically for security reasons but the patch itself is trivial.

I can't successfully reproduce with the PoC but the reported problem makes sense and the fix is what needs to be done. I'd appreciate help verifying this on mozilla-central after it lands there please Seb Patane.
I couldn't reproduce with the duped bug PoCs either. It's just a hard timing thing to get right I think.

Patch v1.
[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): [Bug 699700](/show_bug.cgi?id=699700 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add support for signing and verifying MAR files in libmar and the mar program") added mar signing, but before that we didn't even do mar signing. We never locked the Mar during updates either.
User impact if declined: User that has physical access to a machine, if unelevated can extract files to an elevated location. They can downgrade firefox.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): I tested on oak to make sure updates didn't break. I couldn't reproduce the PoC problem though so I hope the original reporter can help with that.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low
String or IDL/UUID changes made by this patch: None

Let's wait to take this on any branches until it's confirmed to fix the problem on Nightly, and doesn't cause regressions. This means we may not take a fix until FF24, given this is an update change.
When approved last week we expected a quick landing.

> When approved last week we expected a quick landing.
A patch was provided and r+ed 07-08, but there was no approval given until a week after that. Had the sec-approval (which was waiting on release management) been given earlier, then this would have landed much earlier. There is a real cost of context switching when waiting a week after a patch is provided and r+ed. Please set expectations to match turnarounds that you can also match. Thanks.

Brian, we've been working out some of the kinks between branch approvals and sec-approvals. Things should go more quickly in the future.
That said, there \*was\* as much time waiting for checkin as you were waiting for approval and the branch patch did only show up yesterday. We can't take certain things too late in the cycle and the cycle is only six weeks long. We'll be faster in the future but things need to go in fairly quickly when they do get approval.

My complaint was not about the length of time taken, it was about uneven expectations and blame mentioned in [Comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=890853#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - MAR signature bypass in Updater could lead to downgrade").
> but things need to go in fairly quickly when they do get approval.
I test updater related changes on oak and run through several manual tests first. This takes extra time compared to normal approvals which can go in with no extra work after approval. I also have a large queue of other things I'm working on. My average check-in time after approval I'm sure is a day. That being said, the statement is understood and already followed.
