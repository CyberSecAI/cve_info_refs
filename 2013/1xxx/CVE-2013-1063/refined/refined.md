Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `usb-creator` application's unsafe use of the PolicyKit (polkit) framework. Specifically, `usb-creator` was passing the process ID (PID) to PolicyKit for authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **PID Lookup Race Condition:**  The core issue is a race condition related to how `usb-creator` used PIDs for authorization. When a process is authorized based on its PID, the process could terminate and the PID could be reused by another, potentially malicious process.
- **Insecure PolicyKit Usage:** By relying on the PID instead of a more stable identifier, `usb-creator` created a window where an attacker could potentially trick PolicyKit into granting them privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could bypass intended PolicyKit authorizations and gain elevated privileges. This means a user with limited rights could potentially perform actions that require administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a user account on the target system.
- **Ability to Execute Code:**  The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the system.
- **Exploit Timing:** The attacker would need to exploit the PID reuse race condition by quickly taking over a PID previously used by the usb-creator.

**Technical Details:**

- The fix involves changing `usb-creator-helper` to pass the system-bus-name as the subject instead of the process ID (PID) to polkit. This allows polkit to get the information from the system bus instead of relying on a potentially reusable PID.
- The vulnerability was present in `usb-creator-common` versions prior to the patched versions mentioned in the provided documents for Ubuntu 13.04, 12.10, and 12.04.
- The fix was applied in the following versions:
    - Ubuntu 13.04: `usb-creator-common` version 0.2.47.1
    - Ubuntu 12.10: `usb-creator-common` version 0.2.40ubuntu2
    - Ubuntu 12.04: `usb-creator-common` version 0.2.38.2
