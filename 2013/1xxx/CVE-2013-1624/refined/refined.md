  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2013-1624",
    "description": "It was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding oracle.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1",
       "Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1",
      "JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.6.0",
      "JBoss Portal 6.2.0"
    ],
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how TLS/DTLS communicates when using CBC-mode encryption. Bouncycastle implementation does not properly handle padding length, treating padding as having length 1, which deviates from the RFC recommendation of length zero, leaking timing information when decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites were used.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing Side Channel",
      "Improper handling of padding length",
      "CBC-mode encryption weakness"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can recover plaintext from a TLS/DTLS connection by acting as a man-in-the-middle and using the TLS/SSL server as a padding oracle to retrieve the plaintext.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based. A man-in-the-middle attacker intercepts the TLS/SSL connection and exploits the timing differences in the server's decryption process when using CBC-mode encryption to extract the plaintext.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the encrypted TLS/SSL traffic and send repeated requests. This could be achieved by being on the same local network as the server or by having some form of network access to it.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability impacts nearly all TLS and DTLS implementations compliant with TLS 1.1 or 1.2, or with DTLS 1.0 or 1.2, when using CBC-mode encryption, including implementations of SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 that incorporate countermeasures to deal with previous padding oracle attacks. A large number of TLS sessions are required to perform a successful attack (target plaintext must be sent repeatedly in the same position in the plaintext stream across the sessions)."
