| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785631#c0)  David Jorm    2012-01-30 04:48:37 UTC  ``` RESTEasy permits XXE (XML eXternal Entity) attacks. If a RESTEasy endpoint is deployed, a user can submit a request containing an external XML entity. This XML entity will be resolved, allowing a remote attacker to read files in the context of the user running the application server. This flaw affects DOM Document, JAXB and Fast Infoset (FI) input.  Upstream bugs: <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RESTEASY-637> <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RESTEASY-647> <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RESTEASY-659>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=785631#c6)  Julian Coleman    2012-02-22 12:47:57 UTC  ``` EAP 5.1.2 issue:   <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-8054> EWP 5.1.2 issue:   <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-8055>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=785631#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-03-26 15:19:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV Manager version 3.x  Via RHSA-2012:0421 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0421.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=785631#c10)  Ryan Zhang    2012-03-28 08:50:41 UTC  ``` Back port to BRMS 5.3.0 release branch.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=785631#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-02 19:31:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.2.0  Via RHSA-2012:0441 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0441.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=785631#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-25 02:12:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.1  Via RHSA-2012:0519 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0519.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=785631#c15)  Murray McAllister    2012-06-19 02:45:11 UTC  ``` The fix for [CVE-2012-0818](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0818) is not enabled by default.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2014:0372 - Security Advisory

Issued:

Updated:
2014-04-03
# RHSA-2014:0372 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1, which fixes multiple security issues, various
bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat Customer
Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business rules management system for the
management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss Rules.

This release of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 serves as a replacement for Red
Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the
Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 Release Notes for information on the most
significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly
at <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BRMS/>

The following security issues are fixed with this release:

It was discovered that JBoss BRMS allowed remote authenticated users to
submit arbitrary Java code in MVFLEX Expression Language (MVEL) or JBoss
Rules expressions, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the
security context of the application server. Refer to the Solution section
for details on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2013-6468)

It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
attacks. If a remote attacker submitted a request containing an external
XML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing
the attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
(Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2011-5245, CVE-2012-0818)

It was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when
decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding
oracle. (CVE-2013-1624)

It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in
XML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker
able to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read
files accessible to the user running the application server and,
potentially, perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
(CVE-2014-0002)

The CVE-2014-0002 and CVE-2014-0003 issues were discovered by David Jorm of
the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the CVE-2013-6468 issue was
discovered by Marc Schoenefeld of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

Red Hat would like to thank Grégory Draperi for independently reporting
CVE-2013-6468.

All users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains download links (you must
log in to download the updates). Before applying the update, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update, and then after installing the
update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The fix for CVE-2013-6468 enables the Java Security Manager (JSM) to
sandbox the evaluation of MVEL expressions. This introduces performance
degradation in high load environments. The following ways of running Red
Hat JBoss BRMS are considered secure while mitigating performance
degradation:

1. In high load environments where performance is critical, it is
recommended to only deploy applications that have been developed on other
systems and properly reviewed. It is also recommended not to create any
users with the Analyst role on such systems. If these safeguards are
followed, it is safe to leave JSM disabled on these systems so it does not
introduce any performance degradation.

2. In testing and development environments without high loads, or in
environments where rule authoring is exposed to external networks, it is
recommended to have JSM enabled in order to achieve security benefits of
properly sandboxed evaluation of MVEL expressions.

Allowing users with the Analyst role to log in to the Business Central
console when JSM is disabled is not secure and not recommended.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1049675#c0)  David Jorm    2014-01-08 01:57:25 UTC  ``` It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in XML messages when transforming them using an xslt: route. A remote attacker able to submit messages to an xslt: Camel route could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1049675#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-01-08 03:01:05 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response Team.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1049675#c5)  David Jorm    2014-01-22 11:08:50 UTC  ``` Upstream bug:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7130>  Upstream patch commits:  <https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/camel-git?cs=7c9326f4962cdad97d5de89cfb4483e04cab1d35> <https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/camel-git?cs=cc192f87b7c4a43c6cff0646486384c9946e2ac9>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1049675#c6)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-28 21:31:13 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://camel.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2014-0002.txt.asc>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1049675#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-24 18:05:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse and A-MQ 6.0.0 R1 P3  Via RHSA-2014:0323 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0323.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1049675#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-03 21:23:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1  Via RHSA-2014:0371 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0371.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1049675#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-03 21:31:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1  Via RHSA-2014:0372 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0372.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1049675#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-30 18:51:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 R1 P3  Via RHSA-2014:0452 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0452.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1049675#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-30 19:01:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0  Via RHSA-2014:0459 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0459.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=908428#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-06 17:01:21 UTC  ``` A flaw in how TLS/DTLS, when CBC-mode encryption is used, communicates was reported.  This vulnerability can allow for a Man-in-the-Middle attacker to recover plaintext from a TLS/DTLS connection, when CBC-mode encryption is used.  This flaw is in the TLS specification, and not a bug in a specific implementation (as such, it affects nearly all implementations).  As such, it affects all TLS and DTLS implementations that are compliant with TLS 1.1 or 1.2, or with DTLS 1.0 or 1.2.  It also applies to implementations of SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 that incorporate countermeasures to deal with previous padding oracle attacks.  All TLS/DTLS ciphersuites that include CBC-mode encryption are potentially vulnerable.  The paper indicates that with OpenSSL, a full plaintext recovery attack is possible, and with GnuTLS, a partial plaintext recovery is possible (recovering up to 4 bits of the last byte in any block of plaintext).  To perform a successful attack, when TLS is used, a large number of TLS sessions are required (target plaintext must be sent repeatedly in the same position in the plaintext stream across the sessions).  For DTLS, a successful attack can be carried out in a single session.  The attacker must also be located close to the machine being attacked.  Further details are noted in the paper.  Current status of fixes in various implementations:  * OpenSSL has a patch in development * NSS has a patch in development * GnuTLS is fixed in versions 2.12.23, 3.0.28, and 3.1.7 * PolarSSL is fixed in version 1.2.5 * BouncyCastle has a patch that will be included in the forthcoming 1.48 version   External References:  <http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/> <http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=908428#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-06 17:04:06 UTC  ``` So it's not lost, quoting Orcan's comment from [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c7](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c7 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-0169 SSL/TLS: CBC padding timing attack (lucky-13)") here:   Orcan Ogetbil 2013-02-05 20:34:45 EST  Hi, the bouncycastle update is problematic. Namely, we are stuck with version 1.46 because the later version (1.47) comes with backward incompatible API changes. This affects the dependent libraries, in particular itext. Unfortunately we are also stuck with itext-2.1.7 because the next version series (itext-5.*) was vetoed by FE-Legal.   Note that I do not maintain bouncycastle any more. I dropped my maintainership last August after an announcement in the Fedora-devel mailing list. To my knowledge no one picked it up yet, which makes me wonder why this bug CCd me. I can still provide some help though if you can supply a patch. If you provide a patch for bouncycastle-1.46 we can get around this problem.   Also, according to:  <http://www.bouncycastle.org/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/java/crypto/releasenotes.html?r1=1.181&r2=1.182>  This has been fixed in CVS already (although finding the patches that were used might be fun).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=908428#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2013-03-12 22:20:28 UTC  ``` Created bouncycastle tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 920864](show_bug.cgi?id=920864 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-1624 bouncycastle: TLS CBC padding timing attack [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 920865](show_bug.cgi?id=920865 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2013-1624 bouncycastle: TLS CBC padding timing attack [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=908428#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-07-26 07:38:21 UTC  ``` The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having moderate security impact in CloudForms 1.1.

Subject: Re: CVE request: TLS CBC padding timing flaw in various SSL / TLS implementations

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Here are the current CVE assignments related to the
<http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf> paper:

CVE-2013-0169 (a vulnerability in protocols that affects
OpenSSL, PolarSSL, OpenJDK, and probably other implementations):
"We present a family of attacks that apply to CBC-mode in all TLS
and DTLS implementations that are compliant with TLS 1.1 or 1.2,
or with DTLS 1.0 or 1.2 ... a MAC check must still be performed
on some data to prevent the known timing attacks. But what data
should be used for that calculation? The TLS 1.1 and 1.2 RFCs
recommend checking the MAC as if there was a zero-length pad."

CVE-2013-1618
"Opera were notified of our attacks in December 2012. Our attacks
are addressed in Opera version 12.13, released 30/01/2013." (see
the <http://www.opera.com/support/kb/view/1044/> advisory)

CVE-2013-1619
"The GnuTLS implementation of MEE-TLS-CBC deals with bad padding
in a different way to that recommended in the RFCs: instead of
assuming zero-length padding, it uses the last byte of plaintext
to determine how many plaintext bytes to remove (whether or not
those bytes are correctly formatted padding). ... This indicates
that ignoring the recommendations of the RFCs can have severe
security consequences."

CVE-2013-1620
"Network Security Services (NSS) ... the same approach as taken in
GnuTLS"

CVE-2013-1621
"PolarSSL ... The code does not sanity check padlen before running
the padding check, meaning that out-of-bounds comparisons may be
made" (a possible denial-of-service issue for some applications)

CVE-2013-1622
"PolarSSL ... it does not perform any MAC check if this
sanity check fails, but instead exits immediately. This would
render the implementation vulnerable to a simple timing-based
distinguishing attack." (requires a non-default configuration with
"TLS alert messages when decryption errors are encountered")

CVE-2013-1623
"yaSSL ... CyaSSL code does not perform proper padding checks, but
instead just examines the last byte of plaintext and uses this to
determine how many bytes to remove."

CVE-2013-1624
"The Bouncy-Castle code does careful sanity checking of the
padding length (as indicated by the last byte of plaintext) but
treats the padding as having length 1 ... This deviates slightly
from the recommendation of the RFCs to treat the padding as
having length zero"

It is possible that MITRE will assign a CVE name for an F5
vulnerability later. (This is referenced by "F5 were notified of
our attacks in December 2012. They have informed us that their
TLS dataplane traffic is not vulnerable due to cryptographic
offload, but that local management ports and virtual editions may
be vulnerable. They also informed us that F5s hotfix for this
issue will follow shortly after OpenSSL issues their patch." but
that statement may mean that the issue existed in OpenSSL code
that was shipped within F5 products.) Other CVEs related to other
products are obviously also possible.

# RHSA-2014:0371 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1, which fixes multiple security issues,
various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is a business rules management system for the
management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss rules.

This release of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1 serves as a replacement for
Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.
Refer to the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1 Release Notes for information on
the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available
at <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/Red_Hat_JBoss_BPM_Suite/>

The following security issues are fixed with this release:

It was discovered that JBoss BPM Suite allowed remote authenticated users
to submit arbitrary Java code in MVFLEX Expression Language (MVEL) or JBoss
Rules expressions, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the
security context of the application server. Refer to the Solution section
for details on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2013-6468)

It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
attacks. If a remote attacker submitted a request containing an external
XML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing
the attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
(Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2011-5245, CVE-2012-0818)

It was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when
decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding
oracle. (CVE-2013-1624)

It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in
XML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker
able to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read
files accessible to the user running the application server and,
potentially, perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
(CVE-2014-0002)

The CVE-2014-0002 and CVE-2014-0003 issues were discovered by David Jorm of
the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the CVE-2013-6468 issue was
discovered by Marc Schoenefeld of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

Red Hat would like to thank Grégory Draperi for independently reporting
CVE-2013-6468.

All users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains download links (you must
log in to download the updates). Before applying the update, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update, and then after installing the
update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The fix for CVE-2013-6468 enables the Java Security Manager (JSM) to
sandbox the evaluation of MVEL expressions. This introduces performance
degradation in high load environments. The following ways of running Red
Hat JBoss BPM Suite are considered secure while mitigating performance
degradation:

1. In high load environments where performance is critical, it is
recommended to only deploy applications that have been developed on other
systems and properly reviewed. It is also recommended not to create any
users with the Analyst role on such systems. If these safeguards are
followed, it is safe to leave JSM disabled on these systems so it does not
introduce any performance degradation.

2. In testing and development environments without high loads, or in
environments where rule authoring is exposed to external networks, it is
recommended to have JSM enabled in order to achieve security benefits of
properly sandboxed evaluation of MVEL expressions.

Allowing users with the Analyst role to log in to the Business Central
console when JSM is disabled is not secure and not recommended.
