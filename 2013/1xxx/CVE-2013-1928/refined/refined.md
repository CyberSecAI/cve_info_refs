{
  "CVE-2013-1928": {
    "Description": "The do_video_set_spu_palette function in fs/compat_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel lacked a certain error check, which might have allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a crafted VIDEO_SET_SPU_PALETTE ioctl call on a /dev/dvb device.",
    "Root cause": "Missing error check in the do_video_set_spu_palette function while converting ioctl arguments.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users could obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted VIDEO_SET_SPU_PALETTE ioctl call on a /dev/dvb device."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access is required."
  }
