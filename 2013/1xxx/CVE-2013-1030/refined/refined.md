- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A password was passed on the command-line to `mdmclient`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The password was passed as a command-line argument, making it visible to other local users on the same system. This is a weakness in how `mdmclient` handled password transmission.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Passwords could be disclosed to other local users on the same system.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user on the same system could view the command-line arguments of `mdmclient` and potentially gain access to passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be a local user on the same system as the vulnerable `mdmclient` process. They would also need to have the ability to observe command-line arguments of other processes.
