### CVE-2013-1430
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how xrdp handles user passwords when logging in via RDP. Upon successful login, xrdp creates a file (`~/.vnc/sesman_${username}_passwd`) containing the user's password. This password is not stored in plaintext but is encrypted using DES with a known key.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Insecure storage of credentials:**  Even though the password isn't stored directly in cleartext, it uses a weak DES encryption algorithm with a known key. This makes it easy for an attacker to decrypt the password.
- **Predictable file location:** The password file is created in a predictable location within the user's home directory (`~/.vnc/`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who gains access to the password file can easily decrypt it using the known key, obtaining the user's password in a form equivalent to cleartext. This could allow the attacker to further compromise the user's account and potentially the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File Access:** An attacker needs to gain access to the file system where the password file resides.
- **Network access (indirect):** While the vulnerability exists locally, it can be indirectly exploited over the network if the attacker gains initial access to the system using other vulnerabilities or compromised credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access or compromised account:** An attacker must have some form of access to the system where the vulnerable xrdp is running, either with physical access, through another exploit, or by initially compromising another account.
- **Knowledge of decryption key:** The DES key was known publicly, making decryption straightforward.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in xrdp version 0.9.1 and later.
*   The issue was tracked in various bug trackers including Red Hat Bugzilla, Gentoo Bugzilla, Debian Security Tracker and SUSE Bugzilla.
*   The vulnerability is considered a medium severity issue by Ubuntu, though some sources may rate it higher.
*   The fix involved generating a random GUID for each session instead of using the user's password and also updated the encryption mechanism.

This issue was primarily a local privilege escalation risk, however, coupled with other exploits or vulnerabilities could provide more serious impacts across a network.
