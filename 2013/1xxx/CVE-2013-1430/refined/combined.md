| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2016-12-15 15:45:21 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  When successfully logging in using RDP into a xrdp session, the file ~/.vnc/sesman_${username}_passwd is created. Its content is the equivalent of the users clear text password, DES encrypted with a known key.  Upstream bug:  <https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/pull/497>   @maintainer(s): since the package or the affected version has never been marked as stable, we don't need to stabilize it. After the bump, please remove the affected versions from the tree. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-01-09 00:52:35 UTC  ``` @ Maintainer(s): Please bump to >=net-misc/xrdp-0.9.1 ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Matt Turner   gentoo-dev  2017-02-25 20:45:52 UTC  ``` x11rdp and xrdp are removed, per [bug 607096](show_bug.cgi?id=607096 "RESOLVED FIXED - net-misc/x11rdp and net-misc/xrdp: Mask for removal"). Presumably this can now be closed. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2017-02-26 19:51:14 UTC  ``` Thank you for your work. ``` |  |

This fixes an old VNC security issue were the VNC password file is based on the user password.

Now it is derived from a random GUID that is generated for each session.

This GUID can be used in the future for session reconnect and other things.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I know what you mean here, the NULL means it's a pointer. Currently, zeros are used all over the project. I've never liked that NULL is defined differently sometimes.

NULL is a special value for every variable that can be compared to it (i.e. every pointer). But 0 is not always a special value for a variable that can be compared to it. A variable can be 0 and be used, say, as an index. When I see comparison to 0, I need to examine it more closely. It can be a pointer check, or it can be something completely different.

This is the only API to give the modules general data. We don't give the modules access to the entire xrdp internals.

It was not meant to be only user data.

lib\_mod\_set\_param is not only for passing params from config file,

An issue was discovered in xrdp before 0.9.1. When successfully logging in
using RDP into an xrdp session, the file ~/.vnc/sesman\_${username}\_passwd
is created. Its content is the equivalent of the user's cleartext password,
DES encrypted with a known key.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

It was discovered that xrdp used a known key to store session passwords
in text files. An attacker could potentially decrypt the file to obtain a
user password.

## Status
