- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow existed in the handling of JPEG encoded data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening/playing a maliciously crafted movie file containing crafted JPEG encoded data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious movie file with crafted JPEG encoded data and have the victim open this file in QuickTime.
