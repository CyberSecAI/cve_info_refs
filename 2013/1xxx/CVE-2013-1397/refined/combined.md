How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security release: Symfony 2.0.22 and 2.1.7 released

January 17, 2013

•
Published by
[![Avatar of Fabien Potencier](https://connect.symfony.com/api/images/4aed4f5d-e0cb-4320-902f-885fddaa7d15.png?format=28x28)](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/4aed4f5d-e0cb-4320-902f-885fddaa7d15)
[Fabien Potencier](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/4aed4f5d-e0cb-4320-902f-885fddaa7d15)

Symfony 2.0.22 and Symfony 2.1.7 have just been released and they both contain
security fixes for the YAML component (CVE-2013-1348 and CVE-2013-1397).

## [CVE-2013-1348: Ability to enable/disable PHP parsing in Yaml::parse()](#cve-2013-1348-ability-to-enable-disable-php-parsing-in-yaml-parse "Permalink to this headline")

### [Affected versions](#affected-versions "Permalink to this headline")

All 2.0.X versions of the YAML component are affected by this issue.

### [Description](#description "Permalink to this headline")

When parsing an input with `Yaml::parse()`, and if the input is a valid
filename, the input is evaluated as a PHP file before being parsed as YAML. If
the input comes from an untrusted source, malicious code might be executed.

Symfony applications are not vulnerable to this attack but if you are parsing
YAML with the YAML component in your application, check that your code does
not pass untrusted input to `Yaml::parse()`. Note that
`Yaml\Parser::parse()` is not affected.

### [Resolution](#resolution "Permalink to this headline")

In Symfony 2.1, even if the input is a file, it is not evaluated as PHP by
default when calling `Yaml::parse()`; but you can enable PHP evaluation
support by calling the `Yaml::enablePhpParsing()` function.

The 2.1 behavior has been backported to Symfony 2.0. We have also added a
`setPhpParsing()` method that allows you to switch easily from one mode to
another:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```
```
use Symfony\Component\Yaml\Yaml;

Yaml::setPhpParsing(true);
Yaml::parse($filename);
Yaml::setPhpParsing(false);
```

Note that the ability to evaluate PHP files in `Yaml::parse()` is deprecated
and will be removed in 2.3; the ability to pass a filename to
`Yaml::parse()` is deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.

### [Credits](#credits "Permalink to this headline")

I would like to thank [Pádraic Brady](https://connect.sensiolabs.com/api/alternates/37cb6901-891d-4d8f-a4d3-0b8601e9848a)
for reporting this security issue.

## [CVE-2013-1397: Ability to enable/disable object support in YAML parsing and dumping](#cve-2013-1397-ability-to-enable-disable-object-support-in-yaml-parsing-and-dumping "Permalink to this headline")

### [Affected versions](#affected-versions-1 "Permalink to this headline")

All versions of the YAML component (2.0.X, 2.1.X, and 2.2.X) are affected by
this issue.

### [Description](#description-1 "Permalink to this headline")

The Symfony YAML component supports PHP objects parsing and dumping (via the
`!!php/object: XXX` notation).

When parsing an untrusted input that contains a serialized PHP object, it will
be unserialized by default, which can lead to malicious code being executed.

Symfony applications are not vulnerable to this attack but if you are parsing
YAML in your application, check that your code does not pass untrusted input
to `Yaml::parse()` or `Yaml\Parser::parse()`.

### [Resolution](#resolution-1 "Permalink to this headline")

By default, the YAML component does not parse or dump PHP objects anymore; it
replaces them with a `null` value instead.

Two new arguments have been added to the YAML parsing and dumping methods;
they allow you to control the behavior of the YAML engine regarding object
support:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
```
```
// whether an exception should be thrown when an invalid type is handled (a PHP resource or a PHP object)
// when set to false (the default), the invalid type value is replaced with the null value
// when set to true, an exception is thrown
$exceptionOnInvalidType = false;

// whether object support is enabled or not (disable by default)
// when not enabled, Symfony throws an exception if $exceptionOnInvalidType is true and returns null otherwise.
$objectSupport = false;

use Symfony\Component\Yaml\Yaml;

Yaml::parse($input, $exceptionOnInvalidType, $objectSupport);
Yaml::dump($yaml, 2, 4, $exceptionOnInvalidType, $objectSupport);

use Symfony\Component\Yaml\Parser;

$parser = new Parser();
$parser->parse($input, $exceptionOnInvalidType, $objectSupport);

use Symfony\Component\Yaml\Dumper;

$dumper = new Dumper();
$dumper->dump($input, 2, 0, $exceptionOnInvalidType, $objectSupport);
```

"when not enabled, Symfony throws an exception if $exceptionOnInvalidType is false and returns null otherwise."

Shouldn't this say true?

[#3](/blog/security-release-symfony-2-0-22-and-2-1-7-released#comment-18158 "Permalink to this comment")

Hello, I just installed sf2.1.7 with composer, and i'm facing a problem with twig template heritage:
the following line,ok with the previous versions,
{% extends "linceoBlogBundle::layout.html.twig" %}
leads now to an error:
An exception has been thrown during the rendering of a template ("Unrecognized field: 0") in "linceoBlogBundle:Blog:modifier.html.twig"

Is it something linked to the new version?
TIA
