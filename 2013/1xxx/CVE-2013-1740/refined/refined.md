Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1740:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `bugs.gentoo.org` and `lists.opensuse.org` directly mentions `CVE-2013-1740` in the context of an NSS vulnerability, indicating relevance.
*   The `ubuntu.com` document also refers to this CVE in its security notice.
*   The `oracle.com` documents mention the CVE in the context of Oracle Fusion Middleware updates as CVE-2013-1741 which indicates it also bundles CVE-2013-1740.
*   The `bugzilla.redhat.com` explicitly mentions `CVE-2013-1740`

Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the way TLS False Start was implemented in the `ssl_Do1stHandshake()` function within the Network Security Services (NSS) library, specifically in `lib/ssl/sslsecur.c`.
    *   The issue arises when the False Start feature is enabled within NSS, where it may return unencrypted, unauthenticated data from the `PR_Recv` function.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Information Disclosure: The core vulnerability is the potential exposure of sensitive information that should be encrypted, due to incorrect processing of TLS False Start within NSS.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle:  A man-in-the-middle attacker may leverage this to potentially spoof SSL servers

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure**: Attackers can potentially intercept and read unencrypted data intended to be secured by TLS/SSL.
    *   **Spoofing SSL servers:**  An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack and use an arbitrary X.509 certificate to impersonate a server and intercept communications if false start is enabled and the client is vulnerable.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network**: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via a man-in-the-middle attack.
    *   **Specific NSS Implementation**: This vulnerability is present in the implementation of TLS False Start in the NSS library.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Man-in-the-middle**: Attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between a client and server.
    *   **Target must use False Start:** The vulnerability can only be exploited if False Start is enabled in the NSS library.
    *   **Specific knowledge:** Attacker needs a specific understanding of TLS False Start implementation details in NSS to trigger the vulnerability and decrypt traffic.

*   **Additional Technical Details:**
    *   The fix for the vulnerability involves changes in `lib/ssl/sslsecur.c` and the implementation of  `SSL_SetCanFalseStartCallback` which registers a callback function.
    *   The issue is resolved in NSS version 3.15.4

**3. Content Details:**
*   The `gentoo.org` content provides the initial bug report and the affected component, which is `dev-libs/nss`.
*   The `opensuse.org` content provides information about the patch release in opensuse and lists the affected packages which confirms the CVE is related to NSS.
*   The `ubuntu.com` content is a security notice containing the CVE id, affected packages, and how to update them.
*   The `oracle.com` documents contain the vulnerability information in their risk matrix and mentions updates to fix this vulnerability bundled with multiple other updates in a critical patch update advisory.
*   The `bugzilla.redhat.com` content contains the original bug report and some history of the fix, including the specific fix commit ids

**4.  Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the implementation of the TLS False Start feature in the NSS library. False Start was disabled by default, thus limiting the potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   The fix involves both the core NSS code changes and also API changes by requiring a registration callback function (`SSL_SetCanFalseStartCallback`).
*   Multiple different vendors confirm this vulnerability and provide updates.
*   The oracle advisory bundles this CVE with a related CVE-2013-1741.

**5. Summary:**
   CVE-2013-1740 describes an information disclosure vulnerability in the TLS False Start implementation within the Network Security Services (NSS) library. Attackers could potentially intercept and read unencrypted traffic using a man-in-the-middle attack. The vulnerability is present when false start is enabled and the fix involves updating NSS to version 3.15.4 or later and implementation of the callback function `SSL_SetCanFalseStartCallback`.
