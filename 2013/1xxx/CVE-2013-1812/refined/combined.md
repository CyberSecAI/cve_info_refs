| Hi, ruby-openid comitters.  I'm a member of OpenID Foundation. Yesterday, one PHP guy reported a security issue to OpenID Foundation security ML. I got forwarded the message from foundation chair and made a quick fix in ruby-openid. (this security hole seems exist in other languages too)  Basically, this security hole enable DoS attack to any RPs using ruby-openid gem using 100MB+ XRDS file and/or 100,000+ XML external entities. If you need more info or proof of concept code, please send an email to nov@matake.jp  Thanks |

| Hi, I'm the one who originally found the bug...  Just a quick correction for posterity: I'm not a PHP guy (don't get me wrong, I love finding bugs on PHP code, especially security flaws). I just happened to come across this flaw for the first time when I was reviewing Drupal [1], and sent nov a proof of concept similar to the one I had included in my original report to the Drupal security team.  Anyway, Nov has all the info, but if you need anything else, feel free to contact me: reginaldo@ubercomp.com  One more thing: any thoughts on updating the sample rails app? I had to install an ancient (v 1.2) rails to get it running...  [1] <http://drupal.org/node/1815912> |

Hrmm yeah. They disable entity expansion (which seems like a safe bet
for OpenID based XML stuff).

Please use CVE-2013-1812 for this issue, specifically for XIE (XML
Internal Entity expansion).

Just a note on XML External Entity (XXE) expansion in ruby-openid
which uses rexml, according to:

<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedxml/0.3>

Ruby's REXML document parser is vulnerable to entity expansion attacks
(both quadratic and exponential) but it doesn't do external entity
expansion by default. In order to counteract entity expansion you have
to disable the feature:

REXML::Document.entity_expansion_limit = 0

libxml-ruby and hpricot don't expand entities in their default
configuration. So in general the CVEs I'm assigning to ruby stuff will
be for internal entity expansion and not for external entity expansion
since a protective mechanism exists that the application can use.
Steve does that sound right?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=918134#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-05 14:59:12 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way ruby-openid, a library for verifying and serving OpenID identities, performed processing of certain XML files. An OpenID provider could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when processed would lead to excessive CPU consumption (denial of service).  References: [1] <https://github.com/openid/ruby-openid/pull/43> [2] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=804717> [3] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/03/01/5> [4] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/03/03/8>  Relevant upstream patch: [5] <https://github.com/openid/ruby-openid/commit/a3693cef06049563f5b4e4824f4d3211288508ed>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=918134#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-05 15:00:43 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the ruby-openid package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17 and 18. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=918134#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-05 15:01:24 UTC  ``` Created ruby-openid tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 918135](show_bug.cgi?id=918135 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1812 ruby-openid: Vulnerable to XIE DoS attacks [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=918134#c3)  Ken Dreyer    2013-10-29 15:49:04 UTC  ``` For the record, this was fixed upstream in version 2.2.2 of the ruby-openid gem.
