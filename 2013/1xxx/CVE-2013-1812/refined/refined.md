  "cve": "CVE-2013-1812",
  "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way ruby-openid, a library for verifying and serving OpenID identities, performed processing of certain XML files. An OpenID provider could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when processed would lead to excessive CPU consumption (denial of service).",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of limitations on XML entity expansion when parsing XRDS documents, which can lead to excessive CPU consumption or out of memory errors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML Internal Entity (XIE) expansion vulnerability",
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption",
       "Denial of Service (DoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted XRDS document can cause excessive CPU consumption or memory exhaustion, leading to a denial of service condition for relying parties using the vulnerable ruby-openid library.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can provide a malicious XRDS document to an OpenID relying party that is using the vulnerable ruby-openid library.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the XRDS document provided to a relying party.",
     "more_details": "The vulnerability was triggered by large XRDS files or excessive XML external entities, causing the parser to consume excessive resources. The fix involved disabling XML entity expansion and adding a limit to the size of the fetched file. The vulnerability exists in how `REXML::Document` parses XML data."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "Versions of the ruby-openid package prior to 2.2.2 are vulnerable."
 ],
  "fixes": [
     "The vulnerability is fixed by disabling XML entity expansion by setting REXML::Document.entity_expansion_limit = 0 and adding a limit to the size of fetched files. This is included in ruby-openid version 2.2.2 and later."
