Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1779:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the "Fresh Theme" for Drupal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability. This means the theme is not properly sanitizing user-supplied or other potentially malicious data before displaying it in a web page, thereby allowing malicious scripts to be executed within the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
- Inject malicious scripts into the website.
- Steal user cookies or session tokens.
- Deface the website or alter its content.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the "Fresh Theme" of the Drupal CMS. Attackers would inject malicious javascript code that gets executed when a user visits a page using this vulnerable theme. The specific input/data point where the sanitization is missing is not specified in this information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious script into the website's context, possibly through comments, user profiles, or other input forms. They need to target sites using the vulnerable "Fresh Theme".
