Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `Locale::Maketext` Perl module, which Foswiki uses for internationalization. Specifically, a weakness in how the `MAKETEXT` macro handles user-supplied input allows for arbitrary code injection. The original fix for CVE-2012-6329 was incomplete and failed to address all possible attack vectors. This CVE (2013-1666) addresses an additional attack vector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary Perl code through a specially crafted `MAKETEXT` macro.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `MAKETEXT` macro does not properly sanitize input, allowing attackers to pass module names through bracket notation by double-escaping brackets. This bypasses the initial security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the webserver user. This means an attacker could potentially gain full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wiki Page Editing:** Attackers can inject malicious code by editing wiki pages, specifically by crafting a malicious `MAKETEXT` macro.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** Attacks can be delivered via HTTP POST requests to a Foswiki server with enabled localization.
*   **Double-Escaped Brackets:** The vulnerability is triggered by using double-escaped brackets within the `MAKETEXT` macro (e.g., `~~[Some::Module,~~]`). This bypasses Foswiki's initial attempts to restrict bracket notation within macros.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Edit Pages:** Attackers need the ability to edit wiki pages or send HTTP POST requests to the server.
*   **Foswiki with Localization Enabled:** The `UserInterfaceInternationalization` setting must be enabled in the Foswiki configuration.
*   **Authentication (Typically):** While not explicitly required in all cases, usually attackers need to be authenticated users, or take advantage of public commenting features that don't require login.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported against `Locale::Maketext` and was partially addressed in a previous fix. However, this fix failed to eliminate all attack vectors.
*   The vulnerability is considered a Severity 1 issue, meaning it can compromise the webserver.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2013-1666.
*   A hotfix is provided which involves modifying the `lib/Foswiki/Macros/MAKETEXT.pm` file.
*   The provided content also mentions CVE-2012-6329 and CVE-2012-6330 as related issues with `MAKETEXT`. CVE-2012-6329 refers to a similar code execution vulnerability, and CVE-2012-6330 is related to denial of service due to invalid parameters.
