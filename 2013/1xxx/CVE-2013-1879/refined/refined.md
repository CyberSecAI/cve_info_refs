  "cveId": "CVE-2013-1879",
  "related": true,
  "info": {
    "rootCause": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the way Apache ActiveMQ handles cron jobs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary JavaScript code against users viewing the `scheduled.jsp` page within the Apache ActiveMQ web console.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The attacker can inject a malicious script into the cron job configuration of a message. When a user views the scheduled jobs on the web console, the injected script is executed."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify scheduled messages, including their cron configuration. This could be achieved through direct access to the message broker's management interface if authentication is not enforced, or through some other vulnerable endpoint that can indirectly manipulate message queues.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability specifically affects the `scheduled.jsp` page, which displays scheduled messages. By injecting a malicious string, containing a JavaScript code, within the cron configuration, the code gets executed when the user views scheduled messages."
