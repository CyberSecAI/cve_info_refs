Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1708:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `nsCString::CharAt` function within Mozilla's codebase. Specifically, it occurs when processing malformed WAV audio files. The code attempts to access a character in the string at an invalid offset, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary issue is an out-of-bounds read in `nsCString::CharAt`. The code tries to access a character at an index of `(uint32_t)0 - 1`, which is equivalent to 4GB. This index is far beyond the bounds of any valid string, causing the crash. This is caused by an incorrect check for null termination of a zero-length string during the processing of the WAV file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of this vulnerability is a crash, leading to a denial of service. By providing a specially crafted (malformed) WAV file, an attacker can cause the browser to terminate.
- **Potential Information Leak (Limited):** While primarily a DoS, there is a theoretical possibility of a very slow, read-only information leak through the crash behavior. The process crashes if an invalid memory address is accessed. According to the analysis, if the value at the invalid address is non-zero, nothing happens. Only if it is zero does the program then call SetLength and crash in a different way. This could potentially reveal if a byte is zero or not at a given memory location. This process, however, would be extremely slow (one bit per crash) and highly impractical to exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web content:** The primary attack vector is through malicious or corrupted WAV audio files embedded in web content.
- **File Handling:** Opening a malicious WAV file directly in the browser could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted WAV file to the vulnerable application (Firefox, SeaMonkey). This can be done through a website or by tricking a user into opening such a file.
- No special capabilities are required beyond the ability to provide the malicious WAV file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced with the implementation of WAV tag metadata support (Bug 778053).
- The fix involves adding a guard to prevent accessing memory at the invalid index.
- The vulnerability was considered low severity due to the difficulty in exploiting it beyond denial of service.
- Affected versions include Firefox Aurora, Beta, and Release channels prior to the fix in Firefox 23 and SeaMonkey 2.20.
