Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-1693:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from timing differences in the processing of SVG format images with filters. Specifically, the time it takes to process an SVG image with filters can vary depending on the pixel data, allowing for pixel values to be read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Timing attack: Processing SVG filter operations can take varying amounts of time depending on the input, which can be measured by an attacker.
- Information disclosure: By carefully constructing SVG images and measuring processing time, an attacker could read sensitive information such as pixel values and, potentially, text content across domains.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: The primary impact is the ability to leak sensitive data that would otherwise be protected by browser security measures.
- Cross-domain data access: Attackers could potentially read text and pixel data from iframes or other resources from different origins.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious SVG images: An attacker crafts malicious SVG images with specific filter operations that expose the timing differences.
- Cross-site context: The attacker loads the crafted SVG image in a web page or iframe and uses timing differences to infer information about the surrounding content, including text, pixels or links.
- Scripting Required: the information disclosure is facilitated by using script to time the rendering process, which may not be enabled by default in all contexts

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and serve SVG images: An attacker needs the capacity to create SVG images with precise properties and serve them on a website or embed them in HTML content.
- Ability to execute JavaScript: Attackers need the ability to use scripting to measure and interpret timing differences during SVG processing.
- Knowledge of vulnerable browser implementations:  Attackers must have knowledge of the specific browser and versions that have these exploitable timing discrepancies.
