Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-1186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an authentication bypass vulnerability within the IP keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) functionality of Cisco UCS platforms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication checks in the KVM implementation, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the IP KVM console of a physical or virtual device. This could also allow an attacker to join an existing, active KVM session by either having the owner accept the request or by a failure of the owner to respond within 60 seconds. This access would enable the attacker to potentially control or monitor the targeted device remotely.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to send a malicious KVM authentication request to the Cisco IMC (Integrated Management Controller) of a managed computing resource to bypass authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to reach the Cisco IMC of a managed computing resource on the network. The attacker does not require any prior authentication, only network access.
