Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in Cisco Unified Presence Server (CUPS) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service.
- It is caused by the way these systems handle crafted Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets sent to TCP port 5060.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of crafted SIP packets.
- Lack of proper input validation or resource management, allowing an attacker to cause excessive CPU utilization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
- The affected system experiences increased CPU utilization, which can disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is launched remotely over the network.
- The attacker needs to send specially crafted SIP packets.
- The attack is directed at TCP port 5060, which is the SIP port.
- The attacker is unauthenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network connectivity to the targeted CUPS/IM and Presence Service.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be capable of crafting malicious SIP packets.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory mentions Cisco Bug ID CSCua89930 as the identifier for this vulnerability within their systems.
- A workaround of filtering traffic on TCP port 5060 from untrusted sources is suggested.
- Fixed software versions are provided: 8.6.4SU2 for CUPS version 8.6, and 9.1.1 for version 9.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing by Cisco.
- The CVSS base score is 7.8, indicating a high severity, and the temporal score is 6.4.
