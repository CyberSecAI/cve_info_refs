  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-1623",
      "root_cause": "Improper padding checks in yaSSL/CyaSSL.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The code examines only the last byte of the plaintext to determine the number of bytes to remove, instead of performing proper padding checks as recommended by RFCs. "
      ],
       "impact": "A timing-based attack is possible, potentially leading to information disclosure.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of TLS records, specifically during decryption with CBC mode.",
         "An attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted ciphertext."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send encrypted data to the vulnerable service, thus requiring network access.",
      "additional_information": "This vulnerability is related to a family of attacks on CBC-mode in TLS and DTLS implementations. This specific issue is in yaSSL, now known as wolfSSL."
