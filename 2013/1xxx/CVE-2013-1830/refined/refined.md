Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1830:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from course profiles being accessible without requiring users to be logged in as a real user. This means that even when the `forceloginforprofiles` setting was enabled, course profiles were still publicly accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The core issue is an information leak, as course profiles, which can contain potentially sensitive user data, were exposed to unauthorized users and search engines like Google.
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The intended access controls were not being enforced, allowing guest users and the public to view content meant for authenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Sensitive information within course profiles could be exposed to unauthorized individuals or indexing by search engines.
*   **Potentially Unauthorized Access to Course Info:** Depending on the content of the exposed profiles, attackers could potentially gain insights into course structure and user details.
*   **Minor Severity:** Despite the information disclosure, the severity was considered minor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access via URL:** Attackers can directly access the course profile URLs without being logged in.
*   **Search Engine Indexing:** Search engines like Google could index and cache the content of course profiles making them discoverable via search.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special privileges:** No authentication was needed to access the information. An attacker only needed knowledge of or the ability to discover the course profile URLs.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Moodle versions 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, 2.3.5 and 2.3.6, 2.2.8 and 2.2.9.
*   The recommended workaround was to ensure that `autologinguests` and `opentogoogle` settings were disabled (which is the default setting).
