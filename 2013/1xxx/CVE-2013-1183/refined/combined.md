CWE-119,CWE-20,CWE-200,CWE-287    Email      Summary  * Managed and standalone Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) deployments contain one or more of the vulnerabilities:   + **Cisco Unified Computing System LDAP User Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**   + **Cisco Unified Computing System IPMI Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**   + **Cisco Unified Computing Management API Denial of Service Vulnerability**   + **Cisco Unified Computing System Information Disclosure Vulnerability**   + **Cisco Unified Computing System KVM Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities affect only Cisco UCS. Additional vulnerabilities that affect the NX-OS base operating system of UCS are described in Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS-Based Products.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe following products are affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities detailed in this advisory:      Cisco Unified Computing System 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect   Cisco Unified Computing System 6200 Series Fabric Interconnect   Cisco Unified Computing System Cisco Integrated Management ControllersProducts Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco Unified Computing System Fabric Interconnect is the switching fabric and management component of an integrated Cisco UCS platform. Certain vulnerabilities detailed in this section are related to protocols, and while the service is hosted on the Fabric Interconnect the protocols may interact with other components in the Cisco UCS platform such as the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (Cisco IMC) on a Cisco UCS C-Series or B-Series server.      **Cisco Unified Computing System LDAP User Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      Cisco UCS Manager contains an LDAP authentication bypass vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker who can access the Cisco UCS Manager Web Console to authenticate as a specific user without providing valid authentication credentials. To exploit the vulnerability the attacker would need to submit a malformed request to a Cisco UCS Manager login page designed to leverage this vulnerability.       Only Cisco UCS systems that have been configured for direct LDAP integration are affected and certain LDAP options must be enabled on the LDAP server the Cisco UCS Manager is authenticating against. The vulnerability does not affect other authentication methods such as local, RADIUS, authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA), or TACACS+.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtc91207](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtc91207) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1182.   **Cisco Unified Computing System IPMI Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**      Cisco UCS Manager contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) implementation that is hosted on the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect. An unauthenticated, remote attacker who can submit a properly malformed request to the IPMI service via UDP port 623 could trigger a buffer overflow. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.      This vulnerability does not require a TCP three-way handshake to exploit because the service runs over UDP.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtd32371](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtd32371) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1183.   **Cisco Unified Computing Management API Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Cisco UCS Manager contains a denial of service vulnerability in the management API. An unauthenticated, remote attacker who can submit a properly malformed request to the XML API management service of the Cisco UCS Manager could cause the service to stop responding. As a result, administrators could not make configuration changes or perform management actions on the Fabric Interconnect and computing resources managed by the device. A restart of the Fabric Interconnect is required to restore functionality.      This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCtg48206](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtg48206) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1184.   **Cisco Unified Computing System Information Disclosure Vulnerability**      Cisco UCS Manager contains an information disclosure vulnerability. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could access technical support or local backup files that were created by a device administrator. The attacker would need to access the web interface of the Cisco UCS Manager to exploit this vulnerability.       The files that the attacker could access contain sensitive information that could lead to the complete compromise of an affected Cisco UCS platform. The attacker must know the naming convention used by the administrator as well as the date that the files were created. These files are not automatically created on a device, but occur when an administrator creates a tech support bundle file or performs an on-device configuration backup.      This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCtq86543](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq86543) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1185      **Cisco Unified Computing System KVM Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      Cisco UCS platforms contain an IP keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) authentication bypass vulnerability. An unauthenticated, remote attacker who can send a malicious KVM authentication request to the Cisco IMC of a managed computing resource could bypass authentication and access to the IP KVM console of the physical or virtual device. This vulnerability could also allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to join an existing, active IP KVM session if the active owner confirms the request or fails to respond to the request within 60 seconds.      This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCts53746](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts53746) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1186.  Workarounds  * No on device workarounds are available to mitigate these vulnerabilities.      Cisco has released an Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) that explains how to detect and mitigate potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities. The AMB, *Identifying and Mitigating Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Computing System*, is available at: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28729>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.       In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       **Managed Cisco Unified Computing System - System Software**      |  | Affected | First Fixed | Recommended |   | --- | --- | --- | --- |   | LDAP Authentication Bypass CVE-2013-1182 | Prior to 1.0(2h) Prior to 1.1(1j) 1.3(x) | 1.0(2h) 1.1(1j) 1.4(1i) | 2.1.1e |   | IPMI Buffer Overflow CVE-2013-1183 | 1.0(x) Prior to 1.1(1j) Prior to 1.2(1b) | 1.1(1j) 1.2(1b) | 2.1.1e |   | API Denial of Service CVE-2013-1184 | 1.0(x) 1.1(x) Prior to 1.2(1b) | 1.2(1b) | 2.1.1e |   | Information Disclosure CVE-2013-1185 | 1.0(x) 1.1(x) 1.2(x) 1.3(x) 1.4(x) 2.0(1x) and Prior | 2.0(2m) 2.1(1a) | 2.1.1e |   | KVM Authentication Bypass CVE-2013-1186 | 1.0(x) 1.1(x) 1.2(x) 1.3(x) 1.4(x) 2.0(1x) and Prior | 2.0(2m) | 2.1.1e |         **Standalone Cisco Unified Computing System - Server Software**      |  | Affected | First Fixed | Recommended |   | --- | --- | --- | --- |   | KVM Authentication Bypass - Generation 2 and later UCS Servers CVE-2013-1186 | 1.0(x) 1.1(x) 1.2(x) 1.3(x) 1.4(3s) and prior | 1.4(4) | 1.5(1f) |   | KVM Authentication Bypass - Generation 1 UCS Servers (C200/C210/C250) CVE-2013-1186 | 1.0(x) 1.1(x) 1.2(x) 1.3(x) 1.4(3s) and prior | 1.4(3t) | 1.4(3t) |         **Note:** Fixed software for Cisco C-Series C200 M1/M2, C210 M1/M2, and C250 M1/M2 servers is now available.
