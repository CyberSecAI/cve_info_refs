Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an interruption of services. Only devices that are configured for SIP inspection are affected by this vulnerability.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products Cisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software versions are vulnerable when Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) application layer gateway (ALG) inspection is configured under the Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW). To verify whether the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) application layer gateway (ALG) inspection under the Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) is configured on a device use the **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include sip** privileged EXEC command and check whether the output includes **Match: protocol sip**. The following is the output from the **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include sip** command executed on a device running Cisco IOS Software that has the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) application layer gateway (ALG) inspection enabled under the Zone-based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) configuration:   ```   Cisco#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include sip      Match: protocol sip   ``` Inspection of SIP traffic is not enabled by default.      Network Address Translation (NAT) of SIP traffic is not affected by this issue.    To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>.    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability.  No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Enhanced Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) inspection is a Cisco IOS firewall feature that provides basic SIP deep packet inspection functionality (SIP packet inspection and pinholes opening) as well as protocol conformance and application security.   A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) inspection feature under the Zone-based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that would eventually lead to a device reload.      This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed SIP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SIP messages through the device. An exploit could cause Cisco IOS Software not to release allocated memory, causing a memory leak. A sustained attack may result in a device reload.      SIP traffic can use UDP port 5060 and TCP ports 5060 and 5061.      Network Address Translation (NAT) of SIP traffic is not affected by this issue.      **Note**: Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability; SIP traffic destined to a vulnerable device cannot trigger this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtl99174](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtl99174) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only), and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1145.  Workarounds  * Disabling inspection of SIP traffic will mitigate this vulnerability. Inspection of SIP traffic can be disabled by removing the **match protocol sip** command from the corresponding class map used by the Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) configuration. The following example shows how to remove this command from the class map: ```   router(config)#class-map type inspect match-any INSP-TRAFFIC-PROTOCOLrouter(config-cmap)#no match protocol sip   ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.1 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.1 |
