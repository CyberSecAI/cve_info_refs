The provided content is related to CVE-2013-1178.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly handle malformed Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) packets within the Cisco NX-OS-based devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities are present in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) subsystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by passing malformed CDP packets to an affected device. Since CDP operates at the data link layer (Layer 2), the attacker needs to be able to submit an Ethernet frame directly to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected device, such as being in the same bridged network or connected to an unpartitioned device like a network hub. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
