## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-042 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Publisher Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2830397)

Published: May 14, 2013

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves eleven privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user open a specially crafted Publisher file with an affected version of Microsoft Publisher. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft Publisher 2003, Microsoft Publisher 2007, and Microsoft Publisher 2010. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Publisher parses specially crafted Publisher files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files.

**How are** **Microsoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerabilities?**

A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Publisher is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft Publisher that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.

**The** **Microsoft Office component discussed in this article is part of the Microsoft Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Microsoft Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Microsoft Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No. The update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a product version for the applicable software on the system that is within the range of product versions that the update applies to and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## Multiple Microsoft Publisher Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exists in the way that Microsoft Publisher parses Publisher files. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* These vulnerabilities cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, and then convince them to open a specially crafted Publisher file.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open Publisher files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. These vulnerabilities could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?**

These are remote code execution vulnerabilities.

**What** **causes the** **vulnerabilities?**

Although the vulnerabilities are closely related, their root causes differ as detailed in the table below:

| CVE number | Vulnerability title | The vulnerability exists when Publisherâ¦ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2013-1316 | Publisher Negative Value Allocation Vulnerability | â¦improperly validates an array size while parsing specially crafted Publisher files. |
| CVE-2013-1317 | Publisher Integer Overflow Vulnerability | â¦attempts to determine the size for an allocation, causing an integer overflow condition. |
| CVE-2013-1318 | Publisher Corrupt Interface Pointer Vulnerability | â¦incorrectly uses a corrupted pointer while parsing specially crafted Publisher files. |
| CVE-2013-1319 | Publisher Return Value Handling Vulnerability | â¦ignores a returned method value while parsing specially crafted Publisher files. |
| CVE-2013-1320 | Publisher Buffer Overflow Vulnerability | â¦reads the incorrect number of bytes into an array while parsing specially crafted Publisher files. |
| CVE-2013-1321 | Publisher Return Value Validation Vulnerability | â¦fails to properly validate a returned value type while parsing specially crafted Publisher files. |
| CVE-2013-1322 | Publisher Invalid Range Check Vulnerability | â¦validates table range data while parsing specially crafted Publisher files. |
| CVE-2013-1323 | Publisher Incorrect NULL Value Handling Vulnerability | â¦improperly handles NULL values while parsing specially crafted Publisher files. |
| CVE-2013-1327 | Publisher Signed Integer Vulnerability | â¦fails to expect a signed value when allocating memory while parsing specially crafted Publisher files. |
| CVE-2013-1328 | Publisher Pointer Handling Vulnerability | â¦is unable to properly validate a pointer while handling specially crafted Publisher files. |
| CVE-2013-1329 | Publisher Buffer Underflow Vulnerability | â¦allows a negative number to be passed into a byte array insertion while parsing specially crafted Publisher files. |

**What might an attacker use the vulnerabilities** **to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerabilities?**

These vulnerabilities require that a user open a specially crafted Publisher file with an affected version of Microsoft Publisher.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted Publisher file to the user and then convincing the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a Publisher file that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Publisher file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerabilities?**

Systems where Microsoft Publisher is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Publisher parses specially crafted Publisher files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had these** **vulnerabilities** **been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about these vulnerabilities through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that these** **vulnerabilitieswere** **being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.
