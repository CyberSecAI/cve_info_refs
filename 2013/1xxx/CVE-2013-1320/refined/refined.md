Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Publisher reading the incorrect number of bytes into an array while parsing specially crafted Publisher files. This leads to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to incorrect bounds checking when reading data into an array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the current user.
- **System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker could send a specially crafted Publisher file to the user and convince them to open it.
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host a website with a malicious Publisher file or inject such content into compromised sites, and then trick users into visiting the site and opening the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Craft a Malicious File:** The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted Microsoft Publisher file that triggers the buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file. This could be through email, malicious links, or compromised websites.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Microsoft Publisher 2003 SP3.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how Publisher parses specially crafted files.
- Users with fewer privileges would be less impacted than admin users.
- This is one of multiple vulnerabilities addressed by the same update.
