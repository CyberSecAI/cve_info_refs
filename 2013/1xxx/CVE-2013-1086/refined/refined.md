Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-1086

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the "onError" attribute within GroupWise WebAccess. This attribute is used when an error occurs loading a resource, and it was not properly sanitized, which allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Improper sanitization of user-controlled input

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute malicious scripts within a user's browser session.
- This could lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "onError" attribute in GroupWise WebAccess. An attacker can craft a malicious URL or inject the script into a field that will be parsed by the vulnerable component
- By exploiting the lack of sanitization, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript in the vulnerable parameter or inject the script into a field parsed by the vulnerable web application
- No specific privilege escalation is necessary

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects GroupWise 8.x WebAccess up to and including 8.03 HP2 and GroupWise 2012 WebAccess up to and including 12.0.1 HP1.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Bartlomiej Balcerek at Wroclaw Centre for Networking and Supercomputing.
- The fix was implemented in GroupWise 8.0.3 HP3 and GroupWise 2012 SP2.
- Previous versions of GroupWise are also likely vulnerable but are no longer supported, meaning customers should upgrade to fix the issue.
