Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1831:

**Root Cause:**
- Exception messages generated by the Moodle application were inadvertently revealing the server's file system paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive server information, specifically file system paths, within exception messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is considered minor. The exposed file system paths could potentially be used by an attacker to gain insights into the server's infrastructure, which could then be used to facilitate further attacks, but there was no direct way to gain access to those paths using this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves triggering an exception within the Moodle application. This could be done through a variety of methods such as sending malformed requests or by causing errors during normal use. The exception messages that reveal the file system paths would then be presented to the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need special access or permissions. An attacker would only require the ability to interact with the Moodle application in a way that triggers exception messages.

**Versions Affected:**
- Moodle versions 2.4 to 2.4.1, 2.3 to 2.3.4, and 2.2 to 2.2.7, and earlier unsupported versions.

**Versions Fixed:**
- Moodle versions 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, 2.3.5 and 2.3.6, and 2.2.8 and 2.2.9

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved removing system paths from the exception messages.
- The severity was rated as minor.
- The issue was reported by Mark Nielsen and tracked as MDL-36901.
