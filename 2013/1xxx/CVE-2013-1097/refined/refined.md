Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1097:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly references "Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability found on ZCC page" and specifically mentions document ID 7012502, which is the same document that is cited as resolving CVE-2013-1097 in the CVE description. Therefore, this content is relevant to the CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `onload` event within the `frame` tag. Specifically, if a user injects malicious data into the `onload` event, it will be executed without proper sanitization or validation.

*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization or validation for the `onload` event within the `frame` tag. This allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web application (ZENworks Control Center - ZCC). This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
    *   Potentially further compromise of the system

*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious code into the `onload` event of a frame tag. This could occur when a user is tricked into visiting a malicious URL or interacting with a compromised part of the application.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to inject code into the vulnerable field.
    *   The attacker could potentially be an authenticated user or an external user if they can manipulate the URL or inject malicious code into a vulnerable section.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically within the ZENworks Control Center (ZCC).
*   The fix involves checking the `onload` event for all tags and ignoring those vulnerability issues by not executing the event for all tags in `njwc.jar`.
*   The issue was addressed in ZENworks Configuration Management 11.2.4 and a patch was provided for 11.2.3a.
*  The provided content gives more technical detail than the CVE description, specifying the affected component, root cause, and the fix implemented.
