Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect integer conversion within the NTLM authentication process during CONNECT protocol negotiation in stunnel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow that occurs due to the improper integer conversion when handling NTLM authentication within the CONNECT protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the stunnel process.
*   **Chroot Environment:** The code is executed within the configured chroot directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Proxy Server:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by controlling the proxy server specified in the stunnel configuration.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker can also exploit this by performing a MITM attack on the TCP session between the stunnel client and the proxy server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control of Proxy Server:** The attacker needs to either control the proxy server that stunnel is connecting to or be able to intercept the traffic between stunnel and the proxy.
*   **Stunnel Configuration:** The following conditions must be met for the vulnerability to be exploitable:
    *   Stunnel versions 4.21 to 4.54 are vulnerable.
    *   Stunnel must be compiled as a 64-bit executable (32-bit builds are not vulnerable).
    *   Stunnel must be running in SSL client mode (`client = yes`).
    *   CONNECT protocol negotiation must be enabled (`protocol = connect`).
    *   NTLM authentication must be enabled (`protocolAuthentication = NTLM`).
* **Knowledge of Stunnel Configuration:** The attacker would need to know the stunnel configuration to properly craft a malicious request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in stunnel versions 4.21 through 4.54.
*   The issue is specific to 64-bit builds of stunnel. 32-bit builds are not affected.
*   Stack smashing protection, if enabled during compilation, can help prevent arbitrary code execution on vulnerable systems, but this isn't a complete fix.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to stunnel version 4.55 or later.
*   Disable NTLM authentication if upgrading is not immediately feasible.
