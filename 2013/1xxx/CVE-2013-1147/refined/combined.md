| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software Protocol Translation Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20130327-pt  First Published: 2013 March 27 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2013 April 11 15:23 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCtz35999](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz35999)     CVE-2013-1147     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2013-1147     CWE-20       [Download OVAL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130327-pt/oval/cisco-sa-20130327-pt_254.xml)   Email      Summary  * The Cisco IOS Software Protocol Translation (PT) feature contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Affected Products  * This vulnerability affects a device that is running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software and has either a vulnerable protocol translation configuration or a Telnet-to-PAD protocol translation ruleset configured.    Vulnerable ProductsA vulnerable protocol translation configuration occurs when one-step protocol translation is configured, and is using the default incoming connection port number (Telnet port 23). If the one-step protocol translation incoming connection port number is configured for any ports other than the default, the device is not vulnerable.      To identify a vulnerable protocol translation configuration, log in to the device and issue the **show translate** command-line interface (CLI) command. The following example shows a device configured for protocol translation with at least one incoming TCP/IP protocol translation connection configured for default incoming connection port number. If the output does not contain a *translate* entry that has Port 23 listed, the device is not vulnerable. The following output shows a device with a vulnerable configuration: ```   Terminal_Server#show translateTranslate From: TCP 192.168.0.1 Port 23          To:   X25 1234          0/0 users active, 0 peak, 0 total, 0 failures      Translate From: TCP 192.168.100.25 Port 1025          To:   X25 1235          0/0 users active, 0 peak, 0 total, 0 failuresTerminal_Server#   ``` The following shows a device with a non vulnerable configuration: ```   Terminal_Server#show translateTranslate From: TCP 192.168.0.1 Port 1025          To:   X25 1234          0/0 users active, 0 peak, 0 total, 0 failures      Translate From: TCP 192.168.100.25 Port 1026          To:   X25 1235          0/0 users active, 0 peak, 0 total, 0 failuresTerminal_Server#   ``` To determine whether a Telnet-to-PAD protocol translation ruleset is configured, log in to the device and issue the **show running-config** CLI command. If the output contains the configuration command **translate use telnet** and has a defined ruleset with the **telnet to pad** command, the device is vulnerable. The following example shows a vulnerable Telnet-to-PAD protocol translation ruleset configured: ```   Terminal_Server#show running-config | begin use telnettranslate use telnet 192.168.0.1translate ruleset example_ruleset from telnet to pad description *** example translation ruleset *** match source-addr 192.168.100.1 set pad dest-addr 4321   Terminal_Server#   ```  To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products have been confirmed not vulnerable:   + Cisco IOS XE Software   + Cisco IOS XR Software   + Cisco NX-OS SoftwareNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of TCP connection information when a vulnerable protocol translation configuration in the affected software is in use. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to connect to the affected protocol translation resource on the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.      A TCP three-way handshake is not required to exploit this vulnerability. Transit traffic will not trigger this vulnerability.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtz35999](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz35999) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1147.  Workarounds  * The following workarounds are available to mitigate this vulnerability: **Change the Incoming Connection Default Port Number**   For devices that are configured with one-step protocol translation with the default incoming connection port number, an administrator can change the default incoming connection port number to be any suitable value other than port 23. The following example shows changing the default incoming connection port number:      Original vulnerable configuration: ```   translate tcp 192.168.0.3 x25 1234   ``` Configuration with default incoming connection port number changed: ```   translate tcp 192.168.0.3 port 1025 x25 1234   ``` **Skip Ports in Ruleset**   When using rulesets ignore ports 514 and 544: ```   translate ruleset example_ruleset from telnet to paddescription *** example translation using a ruleset ***match source-addr 192.168.0.1   set pad dest-addr 1234skip dest-port 514skip dest-port 544   ``` Infrastructure Access Control Lists Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting the network, it is possible to identify traffic that should never be allowed to target infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the network border. Infrastructure access control lists (iACLs) are considered a network security best practice and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The following ACL example should be included as part of the deployed infrastructure access-list, which will protect all devices with IP addresses in the configured protocol translation incoming IP address range.  A sample access list for devices running Cisco IOS follows:  *!--- Deny protocol translation services packets with source of 514|544.*  access-list 150 deny tcp any CONFIGURED\_PROTOCOL\_TRANSLATION\_ADDRESSES MASK eq 514   access-list 150 deny tcp any CONFIGURED\_PROTOCOL\_TRANSLATION\_ADDRESSES MASK eq 544    *!--- Permit all other traffic to transit the device.*  access-list 150 permit IP any any  interface serial 2/0  ip access-group 150 in  The white paper "Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists" presents guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for infrastructure protection access lists. This white paper is at <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml>.      Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document "Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco IOS Software Protocol Translation Vulnerability," which is available at <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28001>.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.
