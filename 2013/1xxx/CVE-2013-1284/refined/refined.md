Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1284:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel improperly handling objects in memory, leading to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Kernel race condition: The kernel fails to properly synchronize access to objects in memory, allowing for a race condition to occur.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges, potentially escalating from a regular user to a system administrator.
-   **Kernel Memory Read:** An attacker could read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
-   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application designed to trigger the race condition and elevate privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Valid User Account:** An attacker must have a valid user account with the ability to log on to the target system.
-   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to log on to the target system locally.
-   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious application on the target system.
