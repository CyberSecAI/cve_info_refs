Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-1303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a "use-after-free" condition in Internet Explorer. This occurs when the browser attempts to access an object in memory that has already been deleted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: This type of vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to use memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative privileges, an attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, modify or delete data, and create new user accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in legitimate websites or use compromised sites to host malicious content targeting this vulnerability.
- **Email/Instant Messenger:** Attackers can trick users into clicking a malicious link via email or IM, leading them to a site exploiting the vulnerability. They could also send malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the user to view a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- This is one of three use-after-free vulnerabilities addressed in the MS13-028 security update. (CVE-2013-1304 and CVE-2013-1338 are the other two.)
- The severity rating of the vulnerability is "Critical" for client versions of Windows and "Moderate" for server versions. This difference is due to servers often running with Enhanced Security Configuration enabled by default.
- The document also notes that by default, supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone, disabling scripts and ActiveX controls, which mitigates the risk.
- There are workarounds provided, like setting Internet and local intranet security to "High", and prompting before running scripts which can mitigate this issue before the patch is applied.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or known to be exploited at the time of the bulletin's initial release.
- The Google Security Team was credited for reporting this vulnerability.
