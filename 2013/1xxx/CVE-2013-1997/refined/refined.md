{
  "vulnerability": "CVE-2013-1997",
  "affected_component": "libX11",
  "root_cause": "The X client library does not properly validate the lengths and/or indexes returned by the X server, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory writes.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds memory write"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code by providing manipulated data through the X server. A malicious, unprivileged X server could be used to exploit a privileged X client.",
  "attack_vectors": "A malicious X server sending crafted responses to an X client.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the X server.",
    "affected_functions": [
    "XAllocColorCells()",
    "_XkbReadGetDeviceInfoReply()",
    "_XkbReadGeomShapes()",
    "_XkbReadGetGeometryReply()",
    "_XkbReadKeySyms()",

    "_XimXGetReadData()",
     "XListFonts()",
     "XListExtensions()",
     "XGetFontPath()"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability arises from the client library trusting the server to send correct protocol data without verifying that the values are within allocated bounds, leading to potential memory corruption."
