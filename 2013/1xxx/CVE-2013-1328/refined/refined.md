Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-1328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Publisher fails to properly validate a pointer while handling specially crafted Publisher files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper pointer validation when parsing specially crafted Publisher files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker could run arbitrary code as the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts.
- Users with fewer privileges would be less impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted Publisher file.
- Email attack scenario: Sending a malicious Publisher file to a user and convincing them to open it.
- Web-based attack scenario: Hosting a website with a malicious Publisher file and convincing a user to visit the site and open the file. This could also be achieved via compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Publisher file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file. This could involve social engineering, such as tricking users into clicking a link or opening an attachment.

The document also provides mitigation factors:
- The vulnerability requires user interaction (opening a malicious file).
- Users with fewer privileges are less impacted.
- There is a workaround of not opening Publisher files from untrusted sources or unexpectedly received files.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Publisher parses specially crafted files.

The document also clarifies that this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited before the security bulletin's release and acknowledges Will Dormann of CERT/CC for working on the vulnerability.
