Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-1916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of uploaded files in the "User Photo" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin only checks the MIME type of the uploaded file, which can be easily spoofed by an attacker. Additionally, the plugin doesn't properly validate the file extension, allowing for the upload of arbitrary file types disguised as images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **MIME Type Spoofing:** The plugin relies solely on the MIME type provided in the HTTP header, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker using a proxy.
2.  **Insufficient File Extension Validation:** The plugin initially lacked proper file extension validation.
3.  **Lack of Comprehensive File Validation:** The plugin did not thoroughly check the file's content to ensure it matched the declared type (e.g., checking magic bytes).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files (e.g., PHP scripts) to the server. This can lead to:
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete server compromise.
* **Backdoor Installation:** An attacker could install a backdoor to maintain persistent access to the compromised system.
* **Data Breach:** A compromised server can be used to access and steal sensitive data.
* **Website Defacement:** An attacker can modify the website content as they wish.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves uploading a malicious file disguised as an image through the user profile update functionality. This requires an attacker to have a user account on the WordPress site and the ability to modify their profile.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the WordPress site.
2.  **Profile Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access and modify their user profile.
3.  **HTTP Interception:** The attacker needs to use a proxy to intercept the HTTP request for the file upload and modify the `Content-Type` header to match the allowed types.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Exploitability:** The vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit, as it relies on simple HTTP manipulation and a lack of thorough file validation.
*   **Affected Versions:**  Version 0.9.4 and possibly earlier versions are affected. The vulnerability was patched in version 0.9.5.
*   **Patch:** The fix involves validating the file extension in addition to the MIME type.
