Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1881:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

   - The content directly references CVE-2013-1881 in multiple sources, including bug reports, security advisories, and commit messages. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

   - The root cause is an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in `librsvg`. The library was parsing SVG files without restricting the loading of external resources.
   - Specifically, by default `librsvg` would load XML external entities, allowing for a crafted SVG to include external resources.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

   - **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection**: The primary vulnerability is the improper handling of XML external entities, which allows for the inclusion of external resources during SVG parsing.
   - **Unrestricted Resource Loading:**  `librsvg` lacked a strict policy regarding which external resources could be loaded, enabling an attacker to potentially specify arbitrary files or URLs.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

   - **Local File Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the local file system of the victim.
   - **Internal Network Resource Access:** Attackers could gain access to internal network resources by using a crafted SVG.
   - **Confidentiality Breach**: Sensitive information on the local file system of users are at risk of disclosure.

**5. Attack Vectors**

   - **Malicious SVG File**: The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted SVG file.
   - **User Interaction**: The victim needs to either view a folder containing the malicious SVG file via a program that creates thumbnails (like Nautilus), or open the SVG file directly with a vulnerable application.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

   - **Ability to create or modify a SVG file**:  The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a SVG file with malicious XML external entities.
   - **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening or viewing the malicious file via some means. The user may simply browse to a folder containing a malicious SVG file via the file explorer or a thumbnail creator that uses librsvg.

**Additional Technical Details**

   - **Exploit Scenario**: An attacker embeds a malicious SVG file on a website. If a user downloads and opens the file, or views a directory containing the file using Nautilus, the user's system will load the file and, via the XML external entity expansion, transmit data from the victim's machine to a server under the attacker's control. The malicious SVG file contains XML entities that refer to URLs, which are then loaded during parsing. The server specified in these URLs can log the contents of locally loaded files or URLs that the user has access to.
   - **Mitigation Implemented**:
        - The primary mitigation involves disabling the loading of external resources from SVG files by default.
        - The main fix was to use `XML_PARSE_NONET` option in libxml2 to prevent loading from network.
        -  A strict load policy was introduced to allow only loading from data:, resource:, and local file system paths below the base file's directory
        -  Additionally, changes were made in gtk+ to properly handle symbolic icons, to resolve a regression caused by these fixes

   - **Affected Software**:
        -  `librsvg` library and applications using it for rendering SVG files.
        -  `GVFS` (Gnome Virtual File System), `Nautilus` file manager and similar thumbnail generating tools
        - `gtk+` toolkit
