Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1576:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an infinite or large loop within the SDP (Session Description Protocol) dissector of Wireshark. This occurs when processing malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The vulnerability lies in how the SDP dissector parses certain types of malformed packets. Specifically, the dissector can get stuck in an infinite loop.
*  **Large Loops:**  The dissector can also enter large loops which consume excessive CPU resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting a specially crafted malformed packet or convincing a user to open a malicious capture file, an attacker can force Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This can make the application unresponsive and potentially crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed SDP packet onto the network that is being captured by Wireshark.
*   **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker could create a malicious packet capture file containing malformed SDP packets and trick a user into opening this file with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access or File Delivery:** The attacker either needs to have the ability to inject network packets into a network being monitored by Wireshark, or the ability to deliver a malicious capture file to a user.
*   **Knowledge of Malformed Packets:** The attacker needs to craft a malformed SDP packet that will trigger the infinite/large loop in the Wireshark dissector.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of issues (wnpa-sec-2013-01) affecting multiple dissectors within Wireshark (Bluetooth HCI, CSN.1, DCP-ETSI, DOCSIS CM-STAUS, IEEE 802.3 Slow Protocols, MPLS, R3, RTPS, SDP, and SIP).
*   The fix involves updating to Wireshark version 1.8.5 or 1.6.13, which contains a fix for the infinite/large loop vulnerabilities.
