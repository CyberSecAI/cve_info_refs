Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1700:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition and improper error handling in the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows during the update process. When the system fails to copy the updater executable to a safe location before verification, it falls back to using the original, potentially malicious path. This occurs due to a flawed implementation of a fix for a previous vulnerability ([Bug 850492](/show_bug.cgi?id=850492)).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Race Condition:**  If the updater.exe does not exist when the copy operation is attempted, the copy fails silently. Then, an attacker can create a malicious updater.exe at the original path *before* the system sets a write lock on the updater, leading to arbitrary code execution.
* **Insufficient Error Handling:** The system does not properly handle the failure of the file copy operation. Instead of exiting or raising an error, it continues execution using the original, potentially attacker-controlled path. This bypasses the intended security measure of copying the updater to a safe location.
* **Privilege Escalation:** The Maintenance Service runs with SYSTEM privileges. Therefore, if the service executes a malicious updater, the malicious code will also run with SYSTEM privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges on the local machine. This can lead to complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attacker needs local file system access to create a malicious updater.exe in the path used by the maintenance service.
* The attacker has to create the malicious updater in the correct path and at the correct time during the race condition (after the file copy fails but before the write lock on the updater is set). This is a timing-based attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have local access to the file system.
* The attacker needs the ability to create a file in the location where the Maintenance Service looks for the updater executable.
* The attacker must be able to manipulate the timing of file creation to exploit the race condition.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox versions 22 and later.
* The bug report mentions the vulnerability was a regression introduced in a previous attempt to fix [Bug 850492](/show_bug.cgi?id=850492).
* The vulnerability is specific to Windows.
* The bug report includes a patch that corrects the issue by ensuring that the program does not proceed if the copy operation fails.
