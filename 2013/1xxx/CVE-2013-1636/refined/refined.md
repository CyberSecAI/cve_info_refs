Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the OpenFlashChart library used in CiviCRM versions 3 and 4. This library's Adobe Flash program accepts data via query strings, and this data is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of sanitization of input provided through the query string to the OpenFlashChart Flash application allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of an authorized user's browser session. This could allow an attacker to perform actions such as:
   - Stealing session cookies.
   - Defacing the website.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the victimized user, potentially including privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a maliciously constructed link that is crafted by the attacker with the malicious JavaScript payload in the query string, then delivered to an authorized user of the affected CiviCRM instance. When the victim clicks on the crafted link, the injected JavaScript will execute within their browser in the context of the CiviCRM web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL, embedding Javascript.
   - The attacker needs to persuade an authorized user to visit this malicious URL. This could be through phishing, social engineering, or other means.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided text also contains information about the fix:
   -  Upgrade to CiviCRM v4.2.10 or v4.3.4.
   -  Upgrade the OpenFlashChart program by downloading a security update and replacing the file "packages/OpenFlashChart/open-flash-chart.swf".
   -  Remove the file "packages/OpenFlashChart/open-flash-chart.swf" to disable the vulnerable component, but this will break reports and dashboards.
