The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug.

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

|  | |

The problem is here, starting on line 108 of editflagtypes.cgi:
my $type = {};
$type->{$\_} = $cgi->param($\_) foreach $cgi->param();
...
$vars->{'type'} = $type;
We don't require the filtering of ".id" in templates in our XSS-checking test because we assume it will always be a property of an object which Bugzilla has validated the creation of. Here, we instead make up a fake object, trusting all the parameters on the URL. This is bad.
This code was added by LpSolit in [bug 523205](/show_bug.cgi?id=523205 "RESOLVED FIXED - editflagtypes.cgi should use Bugzilla::FlagType"), and checked into the trunk (only) in October 2010. It is not present in 4.0, but is present in 4.2 and 4.4.

(In reply to Gervase Markham [:gerv] from [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=924802#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] (XSS) \"id\" and \"sortkey\" are not sanitized when editing flag types if categoryAction-foo is set"))
> This code was added by LpSolit in [bug 523205](/show_bug.cgi?id=523205 "RESOLVED FIXED - editflagtypes.cgi should use Bugzilla::FlagType")
Not true. I didn't write this code. I only moved the code out of a subroutine when refactoring editflagtypes.cgi, but the code was already there since flags have been implemented in Bugzilla 2.18, see [bug 98801](/show_bug.cgi?id=98801 "RESOLVED FIXED - request tracker"). I can reproduce with 4.0 and 3.6 (didn't try with older releases, but the code didn't change).
I pasted in the URL field a reduced testcase.URL: [editflagtypes.cgi?id="><script>alert(...](editflagtypes.cgi?id="><script>alert(1)<%2Fscript>&categoryAction-foo=1)Summary: XSS - editflagtypes.cgi → [SECURITY] XSS in editflagtypes.cgiTarget Milestone: --- → Bugzilla 4.0Version: unspecified → 2.18

Ah, my apologies.
Anyway, assuming the admin is logged in (if he's not, the PoC fails), if he can be persuaded to load this URL then his cookies can be stolen. :-|
Should we eliminate all exceptions to the filtering requirements? Or would that be overkill?

Neither "id" nor "sortkey" are sanitized or HTML-escaped when categoryAction-foo is set (it doesn't need to be a legal name as long as it starts with "categoryAction-"). So this URL works too (I replaced id by sortkey):

Do not forget that credentials cannot be stolen due to the HttpOnly attribute set on cookies.

# 4.4.1, 4.2.7, and 4.0.11 Security Advisory

Wednesday, Oct 16th, 2013
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A CSRF vulnerability in process_bug.cgi affecting Bugzilla 4.4 only
  can lead to a bug being edited without the user consent.

* A CSRF vulnerability in attachment.cgi can lead to an attachment
  being edited without the user consent.

* Several unfiltered parameters when editing flagtypes can lead to XSS.

* Due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-4189, some incorrectly filtered
  field values in tabular reports can lead to XSS.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    4.4rc1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.4.1
Description: When a user submits changes to a bug right after another
             user did, a midair collision page is displayed to inform
             the user about changes recently made. This page contains
             a token which can be used to validate the changes if the
             user decides to submit his changes anyway. A regression
             in Bugzilla 4.4 caused this token to be recreated if a
             crafted URL was given, even when no midair collision page
             was going to be displayed, allowing an attacker to bypass
             the token check and abuse a user to commit changes on his
             behalf.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=911593
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1733

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    2.16rc1 to 4.0.10, 4.1.1 to 4.2.6, 4.3.1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.0.11, 4.2.7, 4.4.1
Description: When an attachment is edited, a token is generated to
             validate changes made by the user. Using a crafted URL,
             an attacker could force the token to be recreated,
             allowing him to bypass the token check and abuse a user
             to commit changes on his behalf.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=913904
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1734

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.1 to 4.0.10, 4.1.1 to 4.2.6, 4.3.1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.0.11, 4.2.7, 4.4.1
Description: Some parameters passed to editflagtypes.cgi were not
             correctly filtered in the HTML page, which could lead
             to XSS.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=924802
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1742

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    4.1.1 to 4.2.6, 4.3.1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.2.7, 4.4.1
Description: Due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-4189, some
             incorrectly filtered field values in tabular reports
             could lead to XSS.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=924932
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1743
