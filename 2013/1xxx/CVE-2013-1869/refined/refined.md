{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2013-1869",
    "description": "An HTTP header injection flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Satellite web interface processed the return URL parameter for all HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) and HTTP response splitting attacks against users visiting the site.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Spacewalk",
      "Satellite"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The web interface did not properly sanitize or validate the 'return URL' parameter in HTTP GET requests, allowing the injection of arbitrary headers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Header Injection",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and HTTP response splitting attacks. This could result in session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request with a manipulated 'return_url' parameter containing newline characters or control characters.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable web interface. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, just knowledge of the vulnerable parameter.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability is present because the application does not validate or sanitize user input in the `return_url` parameter of the HTTP request.",
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting control characters such as \\r (CR) or \\n (LF).",
      "The fix involves rejecting any return_url that contains control characters."
    ],
    "patches":[
        "Patch to stop trusting return_url: Only allow return-url for 'local' URLs.",
        "Close header-hole: Removes all control characters from the return URL.",
         "final patch is to simply reject any return_url that contains control-characters"
    ]
  }
