  "CVE-2013-1862": {
    "description": "It was found that mod_rewrite did not filter terminal escape sequences from its log file. If mod_rewrite was configured with the RewriteLog directive, a remote attacker could use specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject terminal escape sequences into the mod_rewrite log file. If a victim viewed the log file with a terminal emulator, it could result in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of that user.",
