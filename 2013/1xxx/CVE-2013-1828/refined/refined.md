Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1828:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The provided content directly references CVE-2013-1828 and describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation. The vulnerability is related to a missing size check in the `sctp_getsockopt_assoc_stats()` function when handling `SCTP_GET_ASSOC_STATS` socket option, which can lead to a stack overflow. This aligns with the description of CVE-2013-1828.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is a missing size check within the `sctp_getsockopt_assoc_stats()` function in the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation. When the `SCTP_GET_ASSOC_STATS` socket option is used, the function copies data from user space to kernel space without properly validating the size of the user-supplied buffer.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Stack buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. When the user-provided buffer's size exceeds the allocated space on the kernel stack, a buffer overflow occurs, leading to memory corruption.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can leverage this vulnerability to overwrite parts of the kernel stack. This can lead to various outcomes, such as crashing the system, or potentially injecting and executing malicious code in the kernel context, resulting in privilege escalation.
   - **Denial of Service:**  The stack overflow can lead to a kernel panic, causing a denial-of-service condition.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector is local.
   - The vulnerability is triggered by a local user using the `getsockopt()` system call with the `SCTP_GET_ASSOC_STATS` option on an SCTP socket and passing a maliciously crafted oversized buffer.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - A local user with the ability to create SCTP sockets and call `getsockopt()` is required. No special privileges are needed initially, but successful exploitation can potentially lead to privilege escalation.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

- The vulnerable code resides in the `sctp_getsockopt_assoc_stats()` function in `net/sctp/socket.c`.
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `196d6759` in the Linux kernel and fixed by commit `726bc6b0`.
- The exploit consists of creating an SCTP socket and using `getsockopt()` with `SCTP_GET_ASSOC_STATS` and a large buffer.
- The vulnerability is mitigated on x86 architectures due to compile-time checks of the destination object size, but this is not a complete fix.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes a proof-of-concept exploit.
- There is a mention of grsecurity/PAX detecting the overflow, indicating that these security extensions can help detect such vulnerabilities.
- Red Hat has stated that this vulnerability doesn't affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 because they did not include the vulnerable commit (196d6759), but it was included in RHEL6.5 which also included the fix (726bc6b0).
- It was found that setting the `SLAB_USERCOPY` flag in the SCTP protocol structure prevents the overflow when using grsecurity/PAX.
