{
  "CVE-2013-1591": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `fast_composite_scaled_bilinear` function within the pixman library.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when calculating the maximum x-coordinate during scaled bilinear compositing. The expression `(width - 1) * unit_x` could result in an integer overflow, causing `max_x` to be too small.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could potentially crash an application using pixman or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker could trick an application using pixman into performing a certain manipulation that triggers the overflow in `fast_composite_scaled_bilinear()`.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to influence the parameters used in pixman's image scaling operations such that they cause an integer overflow."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in pixman's manipulation routine.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow, leading to a crash or potential arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability lies within how pixman handles calculations during scaled compositing, particularly in the `fast_composite_scaled_bilinear` function.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could cause an application using pixman to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
          "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker could exploit this by tricking an application using pixman into performing specific image scaling operations which triggers an integer overflow.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to influence pixman's image manipulation routines such that the vulnerable integer calculation will trigger an overflow."
