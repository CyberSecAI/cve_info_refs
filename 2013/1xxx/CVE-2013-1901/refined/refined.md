Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect privilege check within PostgreSQL. Specifically, the REPLICATION privilege checks were testing the *authenticated* user instead of the *current* user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Check:** The core issue lies in the flawed logic of the privilege check, which allowed an unprivileged user to bypass intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Interference with Backups:** An unprivileged user could exploit this vulnerability to execute commands such as `pg_start_backup()` or `pg_stop_backup()`. This could disrupt or interfere with the creation of routine backups.
*  **Potential Data Corruption:** While not explicitly stated, disrupting the backup process might lead to data integrity issues if backups are incomplete or incorrectly handled.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** Although not direct privilege escalation, the ability to run backup commands can interfere with the system's proper operation which can indirectly lead to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the PostgreSQL server, though specific ports are not explicitly mentioned.
*   **Database User Account:**  The attacker needs a database user account, although it does not need to be a privileged one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged Database User:** The attacker must have a valid but unprivileged user account on the PostgreSQL database.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to connect to the PostgreSQL server via the network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is present in multiple versions of PostgreSQL, including 9.0, 9.1, and 9.2
*   The fix involves correcting the privilege check to properly verify the *current* user rather than the *authenticated* user.
*   Several Linux distributions were affected by this vulnerability and issued updates to address it.
* Apple addressed this issue in OS X Server v2.2.2 by updating PostgreSQL to 9.2.4, and in OS X Mountain Lion via a security update that included PostgreSQL 9.1.9.

This analysis provides a more detailed understanding of the vulnerability compared to the minimal official CVE description "An unprivileged user could run commands that could interfere with in-progress backups".
