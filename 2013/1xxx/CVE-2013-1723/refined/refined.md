Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `NativeKey` widget in Mozilla products (Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird) continuing to process key messages even after the widget has been destroyed. This occurs because the widget's key message handling logic doesn't properly check if the widget is still valid before attempting to dispatch key events and plugin events.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF) like condition:** Although not a classic UAF because there is no explicit free, the code attempts to access the widget after its destruction. The widget's memory could potentially be reallocated for other purposes/objects, leading to use of freed memory/object.
*   **Improper Resource Management:** The `NativeKey` widget doesn't stop handling key messages when the widget is destroyed, leading to potential invalid memory access.
*   **Lack of Proper State Checks:** There isn't a check to ensure that the widget is in a valid state before dispatching key events after a destruction event.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potential Non-Exploitable Crash:** If the widget's memory is reallocated to another object, further key events might lead to a crash due to writing to an invalid memory address or unintended modification of a new object reusing the freed memory.
*   **Unspecified/Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although described as likely causing a non-exploitable crash, there's the potential for more severe consequences if the attacker can precisely control memory allocation after the widget destruction. Specifically, the Mozilla bug report mentions "possibly high/critical if we're underestimating the ease of winning the race" implying a race condition exists that if won, may lead to further exploitation.
*   **Key Event Corruption/Hijacking:** Key events could potentially be applied to incorrect objects/plugins.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Triggering Widget Destruction:** An attacker needs to trigger an event that destroys the widget (e.g. by closing a window) while there are pending key events.
*   **Race Condition:** Exploiting this vulnerability may involve a race condition between widget destruction and the processing of queued key events. The attacker might need to make the widget destruction happen quickly after a key is pressed to cause the vulnerable condition.
*   **Dead Key Input:** One potential way to trigger this is by using dead keys, where a key press causes two keypress events that could lead to this scenario.
*   **Windowless Plugin:**  Windowless plugin activity might also trigger this behavior if it closes a window using a native key event, potentially triggering further keypress events on the destroyed window.
*   **Scripting (Browser Contexts):** Although mentioned as non-exploitable via email in Thunderbird due to scripting being disabled there, browser-like contexts (Firefox, Seamonkey) are more vulnerable due to the possibility of Javascript triggering the required sequence of events.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Trigger DOM Events:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger events (e.g., key presses) and then cause the widget destruction during event handling to create the vulnerable condition.
*   **Ability to Win a Race Condition:** To fully exploit this, an attacker may need to be able to precisely time the widget destruction and subsequent key events.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to perform actions such as typing with dead keys or interact with plugin content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Mitigation:** The fix implemented includes a crash condition within NativeKey's `DispatchKeyEvent` and `RemoveMessageAndDispatchPluginEvent` when a widget is already destroyed. While this prevents further event dispatch and makes exploitation difficult, it does not guarantee total protection if the freed memory is reused before the crash. The added crash is more of a safety catch, to catch any future errors of a similar type, according to the bug report.
*   **Vulnerability Rating:** The vulnerability was rated as "moderate" due to the required timing and potential difficulty in exploiting, especially outside of browser contexts. However, the risk is noted as potentially higher if the timing/race condition is easier to win.
*   **Affected Versions:** This vulnerability affects versions of Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird prior to the fixes provided by the update.
*   **Backporting:** Backporting the fix to earlier versions of Firefox was considered complex as the code was moved by a previous bug fix ([bug 855975](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=855975)), and ultimately not done for Firefox 23 and earlier versions (including ESR17) due to the low impact and complexity of backporting a different patch.

In summary, CVE-2013-1723 is a moderate-severity vulnerability involving a use-after-free like condition in key event handling in Mozilla products. Successful exploitation could potentially cause a crash and/or misapplication of key events to other objects. The attack is difficult as a race condition must be won, requiring specific user interaction and conditions to occur.
