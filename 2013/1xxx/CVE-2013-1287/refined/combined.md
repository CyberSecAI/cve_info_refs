## Update FAQ

**Why was this bulletin revised on March 27, 2013?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to correct the workarounds: **Prevent users from connecting to a USB device that has already been installed on the system** and **Disable the USB driver for a USB device that is not already installed on the system**. The original workarounds included steps to block the connecting to and installation of USB storage devices. These steps have been removed from the workarounds because they are unnecessary.

**I applied the original workarounds. Do I need to reapply the workarounds?**

No. Customers who have applied the original workarounds do not need to reapply them because the original workarounds block known attack vectors. However, since it is unnecessary to block the connecting to and installation of USB storage devices, Microsoft recommends these steps in the original workarounds be undone.

**I applied the original "Prevent users from connecting to a USB device that has already been installed on the system" workaround.How do I undo the steps that disabled USB storage device functionality?**

Locate the backup file ("UsbStor\_backup.reg ") created in the workaround. Perform the following command on the file:

```
Regedit /s UsbStor_backup.reg

```

**I applied the original "Disable the USB driver for a USB device that is not already installed on the system" workaround. How do I undo the steps that disabled USB storage device functionality?**

Perform the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:

For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:

```
cacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Usbstor.pnf" /E /R everyone
cacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Usbstor.inf" /E /R everyone

```

For Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012:

```
icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\" /restore %TEMP%\USBSTOR_PNF_ACL.TXT
icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\" /restore %TEMP%\USBSTOR_INF_ACL.TXT

```

## Windows USB Descriptor Vulnerability - CVE-2013-1285

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows USB drivers improperly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-1285](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-1285).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a default configuration, an unauthenticated attacker could only exploit this vulnerability if they have physical access to the system.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Prevent users from connecting to a USB device that has already been installed on the system**

  Use this workaround to block the attack vector through a USB device that has already been installed on the system. You can change the registry to make sure that the device does not work when the user connects to the computer.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **Impact of workaround.** Users cannot install a USB RNDIS device on the computer.

  1. Create backups of the registry keys. Backup copies can be made using a managed deployment script with the following commands:

     ```
     Regedit.exe /e Usb_rndis_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usb_rndis
     Regedit.exe /e Usb_rndisx_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usb_rndisx
     Regedit.exe /e Usb_rndis6_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usb_rndis6

     ```
  2. Create a text file named Disable\_USB\_RNDIS.reg with the following contents:

     ```
     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usb_rndis]
     "Start"=dword:00000004
     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usb_rndisx]
     "Start"=dword:00000004
     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usbrndis6]
     "Start"=dword:00000004

     ```
  3. Run the registry script you created in step 2 on the target system with the following command:

     ```
     Regedit /s Disable_USB_RNDIS.reg

     ```

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Restore the backup files you created in step 1 of the **Prevent users from connecting to a USB device that has already been installed on the system** Workaround, above, with the following commands:

  ```
  Regedit /s Usb_rndis_backup.reg
  Regedit /s Usb_rndisx_backup.reg
  Regedit /s Usb_rndis6_backup.reg

  ```
* **Disable the USB driver for a USB device that is not already installed on the system**

  Use this workaround to block the attack vector through a USB device that has not already been installed on the system. Run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:

  **For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:**

  ```
  cacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.pnf" /E /P everyone:N
  cacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.inf" /E /P everyone:N

  ```

  **For Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012:**

  ```
  takeown /f "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.pnf"
  icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.pnf" /save %TEMP%\NETRNDIS_PNF_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.pnf" /deny everyone(F)

  takeown /f "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.inf"
  icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.inf" /save %TEMP%\NETRNDIS_INF_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.inf" /deny everyone(F)

  ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Users cannot install a USB RNDIS device on the computer.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  Run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:

  For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:

  ```
  cacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.pnf" /E /R everyone
  cacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.inf" /E /R everyone

  ```

  For Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012:

  ```
  icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\" /restore %TEMP%\NETRNDIS_PNF_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\" /restore %TEMP%\NETRNDIS_INF_ACL.TXT

  ```

## Windows USB Descriptor Vulnerability - CVE-2013-1287

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows USB drivers improperly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-1287](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-1287).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a default configuration, an unauthenticated attacker could only exploit this vulnerability if they have physical access to the system.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Prevent users from connecting to a USB device that has already been installed on the system**

  Use this workaround to block the attack vector through a USB device that has already been installed on the system. You can change the registry to make sure that the device does not work when the user connects to the computer.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **Impact of workaround.** Users cannot install a USB RNDIS device on the computer.

  1. Create backups of the registry keys. Backup copies can be made using a managed deployment script with the following commands:

     ```
     Regedit.exe /e Usb_rndis_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usb_rndis
     Regedit.exe /e Usb_rndisx_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usb_rndisx
     Regedit.exe /e Usb_rndis6_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usb_rndis6`

     ```
  2. Create a text file named Disable\_USB\_RNDIS.reg with the following contents:

     ```
     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usb_rndis]"Start"=dword:00000004  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usb_rndisx]"Start"=dword:00000004[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Usbrndis6]"Start"=dword:00000004`

     ```
  3. Run the registry script you created in step 2 on the target system with the following command:

     `Regedit /s Disable_USB_RNDIS.reg`

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Restore the backup files you created in step 1 of the **Prevent users from connecting to a USB device that has already been installed on the system** Workaround, above, with the following commands:

  ```
  Regedit /s Usb_rndis_backup.reg
  Regedit /s Usb_rndisx_backup.reg
  Regedit /s Usb_rndis6_backup.reg

  ```
* **Disable the USB driver for a USB device that is not already installed on the system**

  Use this workaround to block the attack vector through a USB device that has not already been installed on the system. Run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:

  **For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:**

  ```
   cacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.pnf" /E /P everyone:N
   cacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.inf" /E /P everyone:N`

  ```

  **For Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012:**

  ```
  takeown /f "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.pnf"
  icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.pnf" /save %TEMP%\NETRNDIS_PNF_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.pnf" /deny everyone(F)

  takeown /f "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.inf"
  icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.inf" /save %TEMP%\NETRNDIS_INF_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%SystemRoot%\Inf\Netrndis.inf" /deny everyone(F)

  ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Users cannot install a USB RNDIS device on the computer.

  **How to undo the workaround:**
