Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in how Internet Explorer (versions 8 and 9) reuses established HTTPS connections through a proxy. It appears that after several HTTPS connections are opened, IE starts to reuse them without correctly tracking the intended target server. This leads to subsequent requests, including those for different websites, being tunneled through the wrong, previously established HTTPS connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Connection Reuse:** IE's proxy component does not properly maintain the mapping between HTTPS connections and their intended target servers.
*   **Lack of Target Verification:** IE does not seem to verify that subsequent requests are directed to the originally intended server when reusing HTTPS connections.
*   **Reliance on Server-Side Checks (that can be bypassed):** While RFC 6066 recommends web servers check for hostname mismatches, this check can be bypassed by using a custom server that does not implement it. This makes the client vulnerability more impactful.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** By directing requests to a malicious server, an attacker can capture cookies intended for other websites. This allows impersonation and potentially access to sensitive user accounts.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data sent in GET or POST requests can be intercepted by the malicious server, as the requests are tunneled through the wrong HTTPS connection.
*   **Phishing/Masquerading:** The attacker can use this vulnerability to make IE believe it's communicating with a legitimate site, while actually communicating with a malicious server, potentially tricking users into providing credentials or sensitive information. The attacker can serve a website and make it look as if it was a trusted domain
*   **Internal Network Attacks**: This can be used to steal cookies for internal services, especially if they use SAML for authentication to services.
*   **Crash**:  The IE may crash in some instances when using the website

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted website that initiates a series of HTTPS connections, then initiates requests to other websites.
*   **Proxy Configuration:** The vulnerability relies on the user's IE configuration using the same proxy for both HTTP and HTTPS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a webserver accessible by the target.
*   **Proxy Compatibility:** The attacker needs to exploit the victim's IE configuration such that the user is using the same proxy for HTTP and HTTPS.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft in December 2011 but was not addressed in IE 8 & 9.
*   The vulnerability affects both external and internal web services.
*   The provided example uses a custom server to bypass host header checks (RFC 6066).
*   The provided content includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) setup utilizing Squid and Apache.
