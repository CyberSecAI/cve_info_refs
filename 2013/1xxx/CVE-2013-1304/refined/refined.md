    "summary": "The provided document describes a security update (MS13-028) that addresses multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, including CVE-2013-1304. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory after they have been deleted.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the logged-in user. This could allow the attacker to gain control of the system, install malicious programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web-based attacks: An attacker could host a malicious website or compromise a legitimate one to serve specially crafted content to exploit the vulnerability.",

      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host or inject malicious content into a website and then convince a user to view it with Internet Explorer, or convince the user to click a link in email or instant messenger that directs the user to the attacker's website.",
         "additional_info": "The severity of the vulnerability is rated as 'Critical' for client versions of Windows and 'Moderate' for server versions. The update addresses the issue by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. The document also provides workarounds, such as setting the security level to 'High' in Internet Explorer, disabling Active Scripting, and using the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)."
