Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw within the Wireshark dissection engine itself, which could lead to a crash. The specific dissection logic that failed isn't described, but it is located in the core engine of the application and affects the packet processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a crash within the dissection engine. This indicates a programming flaw that causes the application to terminate unexpectedly when it processes malformed packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. A crafted packet can be injected into the network or read from a file, causing Wireshark to crash and become unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
There are two main attack vectors:
1.  **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed packet onto the network that Wireshark is monitoring, triggering the crash.
2.  **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker can convince a Wireshark user to open a malicious packet capture file containing the malformed packets, again causing the application to crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to either:
1.  **Inject packets:** Be in a position to inject network packets that Wireshark is monitoring. This usually requires network access to the same network segment.
2.  **Social Engineering:** Convince the victim to open a malicious capture file using Wireshark. This does not require any special network access for the attacker, only for the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is referred to as "wnpa-sec-2013-08" in the Wireshark security advisory.
- The bug report mentions the affected component as "TShark", which is the command-line version of Wireshark. Thus the vulnerability affects both the GUI and the command line versions.
- A fix for this vulnerability was included in Wireshark versions 1.8.5 and 1.6.13.
- A sample PCAP file that triggers this vulnerability is referenced: "packet-per.pcap"
