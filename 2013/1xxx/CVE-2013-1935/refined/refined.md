{
  "CVE-2013-1935": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) initialized a guest's registered pv_eoi (paravirtualized end-of-interrupt) indication flag when entering the guest. An unprivileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to crash the host.",
    "Root cause": "Improper initialization of the guest's pv_eoi flag in KVM.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of guest's paravirtualized end-of-interrupt (pv_eoi) flag during guest entry.",
      "Missing check to ensure that updates are performed with interrupts enabled"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unprivileged guest user can crash the host.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploiting the vulnerability within a guest virtual machine."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an unprivileged user account inside a KVM guest machine."
  }
