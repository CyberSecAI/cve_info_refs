## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

# 4.4.1, 4.2.7, and 4.0.11 Security Advisory

Wednesday, Oct 16th, 2013
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A CSRF vulnerability in process_bug.cgi affecting Bugzilla 4.4 only
  can lead to a bug being edited without the user consent.

* A CSRF vulnerability in attachment.cgi can lead to an attachment
  being edited without the user consent.

* Several unfiltered parameters when editing flagtypes can lead to XSS.

* Due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-4189, some incorrectly filtered
  field values in tabular reports can lead to XSS.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    4.4rc1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.4.1
Description: When a user submits changes to a bug right after another
             user did, a midair collision page is displayed to inform
             the user about changes recently made. This page contains
             a token which can be used to validate the changes if the
             user decides to submit his changes anyway. A regression
             in Bugzilla 4.4 caused this token to be recreated if a
             crafted URL was given, even when no midair collision page
             was going to be displayed, allowing an attacker to bypass
             the token check and abuse a user to commit changes on his
             behalf.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=911593
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1733

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    2.16rc1 to 4.0.10, 4.1.1 to 4.2.6, 4.3.1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.0.11, 4.2.7, 4.4.1
Description: When an attachment is edited, a token is generated to
             validate changes made by the user. Using a crafted URL,
             an attacker could force the token to be recreated,
             allowing him to bypass the token check and abuse a user
             to commit changes on his behalf.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=913904
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1734

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.1 to 4.0.10, 4.1.1 to 4.2.6, 4.3.1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.0.11, 4.2.7, 4.4.1
Description: Some parameters passed to editflagtypes.cgi were not
             correctly filtered in the HTML page, which could lead
             to XSS.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=924802
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1742

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    4.1.1 to 4.2.6, 4.3.1 to 4.4
Fixed In:    4.2.7, 4.4.1
Description: Due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-4189, some
             incorrectly filtered field values in tabular reports
             could lead to XSS.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=924932
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-1743

Hum, this was supposed to be fixed by [bug 790296](/show_bug.cgi?id=790296 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Field values are not escaped correctly in tabular reports"). There must be another place in the JS code which also needs HTML-filtering. (It's a bit irritating that YUI is unable to filter stuff itself).OS: Linux â†’ AllHardware: x86\_64 â†’ AllTarget Milestone: --- â†’ Bugzilla 4.2Version: unspecified â†’ 4.1.1

> Not only JS:
Right. I found what the problem was for this specific case. A div had |FILTER js| instead of |FILTER html|. The root cause for [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=924932#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Field values are (still) not escaped correctly in tabular reports") is still unknown, though.

... which was a regression due to [bug 640987](/show_bug.cgi?id=640987 "RESOLVED FIXED - YUI is only used for the first tabular report when using multiple tables").

I can reproduce [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=924932#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Field values are (still) not escaped correctly in tabular reports") only if the horizontal axis has evil data. If only the vertical axis has it, it's fine.

â€” [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=924932&attachment=816319)

Better patch: only decode HTML entities when necessary, i.e. for row values only (column values are not HTML-escaped). This correctly handles improbable strings such as "&amp;gt; &lt;" (which must not be converted to "&gt; <" or "> <").
