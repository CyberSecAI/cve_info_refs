Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Apache Rave application exposes the full user object, including the salted and hashed password, through the User RPC API.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The application returns sensitive user data, including hashed passwords, via an API endpoint.
    *   **Insecure API Design:** The User RPC API endpoint is not properly restricted and allows retrieval of all user objects.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker who is authenticated can retrieve all user data, including hashed passwords.
    *   This can lead to further attacks like brute-forcing the passwords, impersonation, or other forms of account compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request to the `/app/api/rpc/users/get` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Apache Rave application.
    *   The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Apache Rave versions 0.11 to 0.20.
*   The provided example request ` /app/api/rpc/users/get?offset=OFFSET` demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The response includes not only user details such as email and usernames but also their hashed passwords.
*   The content provides more specific details about the vulnerable API endpoint and the nature of the leaked information than the standard CVE description placeholder.
