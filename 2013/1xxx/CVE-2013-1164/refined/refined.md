Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1164:

**Verification:**

The content from `tools.cisco.com_dbb5f5a0_20250125_155319.html` explicitly mentions "CVE-2013-1164" in relation to a vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software for 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers. This confirms the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of fragmented IPv6 multicast traffic by Cisco 1000 Series ASR devices with ASR1000-ESP40 or ASR1000-ESP100. Specifically, the Cisco Multicast Leaf Recycle Elimination (MLRE) feature processing of fragmented multicast IPv6 packets can cause a crash.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   The vulnerability lies in the way the Cisco IOS XE software processes fragmented IPv6 multicast packets, particularly when MLRE is enabled.
    *   This suggests a lack of proper input validation, boundary checking, or error handling when dealing with fragmented packets, leading to a condition where the processing logic becomes unstable and crashes the ESP card.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit results in the affected Cisco ESP card reloading, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Repeated exploitation can lead to a sustained DoS.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can send fragmented IPv6 multicast packets to a vulnerable system. These packets can be either traversing through or destined to the affected device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.
    *   The attacker does not require authentication.
    *   The attacker does not need any special privileges other than network access.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with Embedded Services Processor 40 (ASR1000-ESP40) or Embedded Services Processor 100 (ASR1000-ESP100).
*   The Cisco MLRE feature is enabled by default on all Cisco IOS XE Software versions starting with 3.4.1S when using the specified ESP cards.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered when IPv6 is enabled and traffic is being processed, with MLRE also enabled.
*   The document also provides guidance on how to check if IPv6 is enabled and how to identify if the affected ESP cards are installed on a specific ASR router.
*   The vulnerability is tracked by Cisco bug ID CSCtz97563.
