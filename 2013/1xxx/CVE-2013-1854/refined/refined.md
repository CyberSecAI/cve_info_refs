  "CVE-2013-1854": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled hashes in certain queries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial of service (resource consumption) attack by sending specially crafted queries that would result in the creation of Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of hashes in queries within Ruby on Rails, leading to uncontrolled symbol creation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Denial of Service (DoS) via resource exhaustion",
        "Uncontrolled symbol creation"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by consuming server resources, specifically by creating Ruby symbols that are not garbage collected, ultimately exhausting memory.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted HTTP requests containing malicious queries",
        "Exploiting application endpoints that use user-controlled hash parameters in database queries"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a Ruby on Rails application that processes user inputs within a database query. No special privileges or access is required."
