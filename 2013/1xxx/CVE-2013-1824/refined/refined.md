Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an XML External Entity (XXE) injection issue within the SOAP parser of PHP. Specifically, the `soap_xmlParseFile` and `soap_xmlParseMemory` functions were susceptible to this flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The SOAP parser did not properly sanitize or restrict external entity declarations within a WSDL file, allowing an attacker to include malicious XML external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation could enable a remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, accessible by the PHP application's privileges. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information like configuration files, credentials, or other critical system data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious WSDL File:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious SOAP WSDL file. This file would contain an XML external entity declaration that points to a local file on the server or a remote resource. When the vulnerable PHP SOAP parser processes this file, it tries to resolve the defined entity, leading to information disclosure.
- **SOAP Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when a PHP application processes untrusted SOAP object input from clients.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted SOAP WSDL file to a vulnerable PHP application or send a malicious SOAP object.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable System:** The attacker needs some understanding of the vulnerable PHP application, especially how it parses SOAP input and WSDL files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially addressed in PHP versions 5.3.23 and 5.4.13.
*   There were incorrect or incomplete fixes in previous versions (5.3.22 and 5.4.12), which led to the assignment of this CVE, however, Red Hat states they did not provide the incorrect fix.
*   The vulnerability is associated with the earlier CVE-2013-1643 as this CVE addresses an incomplete fix for the earlier CVE.
