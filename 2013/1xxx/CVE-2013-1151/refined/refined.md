Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the function used to validate digital certificates during authentication in Cisco ASA Software. Specifically, there is an implementation error in the code that validates digital certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper validation of digital certificates.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered during authentication when a crafted certificate is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing a reload of the affected Cisco ASA device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to send a crafted certificate to trigger an authentication operation.
*   The traffic must be directed to the affected system.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the targeted Cisco ASA device.
*   The attacker must have the ability to craft a malicious digital certificate.
*   No authentication is required for the initial attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected software is Cisco ASA Software, which is used in Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, and Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall.
*   The vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode.
*   Digital certificate authentication is not enabled by default, so the vulnerable feature needs to be explicitly configured to be exploitable.
*   The vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc72408.

The advisory provides a CVSS v2 vector string for this vulnerability: `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C`. This translates to:
    *   **Access Vector (AV):** Network
    *   **Access Complexity (AC):** Low
    *   **Authentication (Au):** None
    *   **Confidentiality Impact (C):** None
    *  **Integrity Impact (I):** None
    *   **Availability Impact (A):** Complete
    *   **Exploitability (E):** Functional
    *   **Remediation Level (RL):** Official Fix
    *   **Report Confidence (RC):** Confirmed

This CVSS vector yields a base score of 7.8 and a temporal score of 6.4.
