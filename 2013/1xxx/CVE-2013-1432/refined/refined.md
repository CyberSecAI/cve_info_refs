Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-1432:

**Root Cause:**

*   A patch (XSA-45/CVE-2013-1918) aimed at making error handling paths preemptible in Xen introduced a flaw in page reference counting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The fix for XSA-45/CVE-2013-1918 failed to properly maintain references on pages that were stored for deferred cleanup. Specifically, the fix did not retain a reference count on the page before storing it for deferred cleanup.
*   This resulted in the hypervisor potentially attempting to free a page prematurely while it was still in use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious or buggy PV (Paravirtualized) guest kernel can trigger the premature page free, leading to a hypervisor crash and system-wide denial of service.
*  **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The advisory mentions that privilege escalation cannot be excluded, though details are not specified in the provided text. This implies a potential for more severe exploits beyond DoS could exist.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a malicious or buggy PV guest kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have control over a PV guest kernel on a vulnerable Xen system.
*   The system must have the problematic patch (XSA-45/CVE-2013-1918) applied.

**Technical Details:**

* The issue occurs within the hypervisor's memory management when dealing with deferred page cleanups.
*  The reference count error is introduced in the handling paths of the XSA-45/CVE-2013-1918 fix making them preemptible.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability affects Xen versions with the problematic XSA-45 patch applied (specifically Xen 4.1.x and 4.2.x).
* The issue is triggered specifically by PV guests, not HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guests.
* Patches for Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and unstable branch are available as resolutions.
