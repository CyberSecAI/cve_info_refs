Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) improperly handling objects in memory. This improper handling leads to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition within the win32k.sys driver. This means that multiple threads or processes are accessing and modifying shared memory or resources without proper synchronization mechanisms. This can lead to unpredictable and erroneous states.
*   **Improper Object Handling:** The driver's flawed handling of objects in memory is the direct cause of this race condition, although specific details of this handling are not given.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system. This means they can potentially bypass security restrictions and perform actions that require administrative or system-level access.
*   **Kernel Memory Access:**  The vulnerability enables the attacker to read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory. This is a significant security risk, as kernel memory often contains sensitive information, including passwords, cryptographic keys, and other system data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system. This means that the attack cannot be performed remotely by an unauthenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system with valid logon credentials.
*   **Ability to Run Code:** The attacker must be able to execute a specially crafted application on the system. This application is designed to trigger the race condition vulnerability and exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities fixed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-016, which addresses multiple race conditions in `win32k.sys`
*   The vulnerability was privately reported, primarily by Mateusz "j00ru" Jurczyk, along with Gynvael Coldwind in some instances.
*   The provided documents are related to the vulnerability, as the Microsoft document explicitly mentions the CVE ID and the j00ru blog is credited as the discoverer of this and other related vulnerabilities.
