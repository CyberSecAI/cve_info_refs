Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-1435:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Shell Escaping Issues:** Specifically, the vulnerability lies in two areas:
    - `snmp.php`: Instead of using `escapeshellarg()`, a custom escaping function was used, which was insufficient to prevent shell injection.
    - `rrd.php`: User input was not properly escaped before being passed to the `rrdtool` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary shell commands on the server hosting Cacti by injecting malicious code through the vulnerable parameters in the SNMP settings or RRDTool commands. This could lead to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By manipulating input to SNMP settings via the web interface.
- By manipulating input that is used to build commands for RRDTool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Cacti web interface.
- The attacker would need to have a position from where they can manipulate the SNMP settings or RRDTool commands.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented by using `escapeshellarg()` function in `snmp.php` and by ensuring all user input is properly escaped in `rrd.php`
- This vulnerability was addressed in Cacti version 0.8.8b.
