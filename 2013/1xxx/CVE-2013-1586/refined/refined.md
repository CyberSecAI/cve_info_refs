Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1586:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The DTLS dissector in Wireshark has a flaw that can cause it to crash. This flaw is triggered by malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The DTLS dissector has a flaw that causes a crash when processing certain malformed DTLS packets. The specific nature of the malformation isn't detailed, but it relates to how the dissector handles the packet structure.

**Impact of exploitation:**  A successful exploit can cause Wireshark to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
    *   **Network Injection:** An attacker could inject a malformed DTLS packet onto the network, triggering the crash when Wireshark analyzes the traffic.
    *   **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can craft a malicious packet trace file containing the malformed packet and trick a user into opening the file with Wireshark.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to either inject network traffic or provide a malicious capture file.
    *   The attacker needs to craft a specific malformed DTLS packet to trigger the crash.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.8.0 to 1.8.4 and 1.6.0 to 1.6.12
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Wireshark versions 1.8.5 and 1.6.13.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Laurent Butti.
*   The fix involved changes in how `fragment_set_tot_len` handles DTLS fragments, including sanity checks and NULL checks, and reverting call orders.
