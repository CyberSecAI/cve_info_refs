Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the `updater.exe` in Mozilla products (like Firefox, Thunderbird, etc.) on Windows loads specific DLL files from the update directory. This can be exploited by placing a malicious DLL (specifically `profapi.dll` according to the report) in the update directory, which will then be loaded and executed by `updater.exe`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking:** The primary vulnerability is DLL hijacking. The `updater.exe` attempts to load DLLs from its working directory before checking system directories.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The `updater.exe` is executed with elevated privileges in some cases (such as when using the Mozilla Maintenance Service, or when a user approves a UAC prompt), allowing the injected DLL to also run with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can achieve local privilege escalation by placing a malicious DLL that gets loaded by the `updater.exe` when the updater is running with elevated privileges. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `updater.exe`
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's system through the malicious DLL.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Access:** An attacker needs to have write access to the update directory to place the malicious DLL.
*   **Triggering the Updater:** The attacker can trigger the updater by initiating an update process or by running the `updater.exe` directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Write Access:** The attacker requires write access to the update directory.
*   **Social Engineering (in some cases):** The user would need to approve a UAC prompt if the Mozilla Maintenance Service is disabled, which could be part of a social engineering attack.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially tested on Windows 7 (32 and 64-bit) with Firefox 20.0, but it was later found to affect other versions of Windows including Windows 8.
*   The vulnerability was confirmed to not be exploitable when using the Mozilla Maintenance Service *after* a fix was introduced in v21 which copies `updater.exe` to a secure location.
*   The `profapi.dll` was the specific malicious DLL used in the proof of concept, however, other DLLs could also be exploited.
*   The fix involved delaying the loading of certain DLLs by the updater, and explicitly specifying to delay load the vulnerable DLL in the Makefile. A patch was created to address this issue by blocking DLLs in the current directory of the unelevated updater before elevation.
*   There was a discussion on whether this should be considered a sec-high issue due to the fact that for non-service updates, an attacker would need the user to approve a UAC prompt. However, it was noted that an unprivileged process could disable the maintenance service via a pref, making the vulnerability equally as critical.

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-1712 is a DLL hijacking vulnerability in Mozilla updaters on Windows that could allow an attacker with local access to escalate their privileges by placing a malicious DLL in the update directory. This issue was fixed in Firefox 23, Firefox ESR 17.0.8, and other related products.
