| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=859072#c0)• 12 years ago |
|  | |

The updater component is still vulnerable (see 830134) to a library-based attack. The exe loads the profapi.dll from the update directory, for example while performing an update. That can lead to privilege escalation while updating with the Mozilla Maintenance Service.
I have tested this on win7 pro 32bit and 64bit with Firefox 20.0.
Steps to reproduce:
1.) Download poc and extract the .dll file.
2.) Copy the updater.exe from the firefox directory to the poc directory
3.) Start the updater.exe
The updater loads the "profapi.dll" and executes system("calc").
The profapi.dll from the system directory should be loaded.

We did perform extensive testing on the related bug(s), using ProcMon and WinObj to search for all possible DLLs. This one didn't show up for us at that time.
We'll look into this one ASAP.
Since we've invested a fair amount of time in this and other DLL injection issues, we might want to ask ourselves what we can do to avoid the DLL whack-a-mole problem in the future.

By the way, for service updates we now copy updater.exe alongside the maintenanceservice in a high integrity location. This makes it so dll attacks like this are not possible with the service.
For non service updates, this is still kind of a problem, but at least there's a UAC prompt.
We should still fix this though. Maybe the DLL is now being loaded because of new code that was added to updater at some point.

So the steps in [Comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=859072#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the profapi.dll from the update directory") need to be checked against non service updates only.Group: mozilla-corporation-confidential

Only to clarify: on my system I'm able to exploit this issue to execute the .dll with system rights with Maintenance Service 20.0.

I don't think this particular DLL is an issue for the following reasons:
- For maintenance service updates, as I understand it, we are now copying the updater to a secure location before executing it. That secure location would not have this DLL in it.
- For updates where the maintenance service is NOT installed, if you copy this DLL to "C:\Users\Kamil\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Nightly\updates\0" it executes calc.exe, but it doesn't execute it as elevated. Updater.exe would eventually elevate but it crashes before then so the DLL is never loaded by the elevated udpater.exe.
I did find that the steps we used to populate the DLL list had a problem in it though, so I think we should re-do the test to verify the new list of DLLs on each platform.

This DLL was an issue with the service in v20 though but is already fixed in v21

We should check if SetDefaultDllDirectories will be of any help to this type of dlls. You can remove the current app directory from the search order with it. Unfortunately if it does help though, it's only available in win8 and some patched versions of win7. From the documentation though it sounds like it only applies to LoadLibrary calls which would not help here.

I agree with Kamil in [Comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=859072#c10 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the profapi.dll from the update directory") and [Comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=859072#c11 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the profapi.dll from the update directory") by the way. The risk here with this particular DLL is not with someone being able to exploit our updater, but just with someone being able to copy our signed updater and a dll to a machine and then request elevation showing a Mozilla certificate, yet executing their code. Unfortunately I don' think there's much we can do about that though because someone could always use a similar attack of an already public old signed updater.exe.

For this one:
> [https://intranet.mozilla.org/User:Mwobensmith@mozilla.com/DLL\_Hijacking\_Updater](https://intranet.mozilla.org/User%3AMwobensmith%40mozilla.com/DLL_Hijacking_Updater)
We should update the steps here and re-run the test on all OS please:
> Download and launch the ProcMon tool and set the following filters:
> Process Name is firefoxinstaller.exe
Should say updater.exe instead. Otherwise we are probably checking a subset of the correct DLLs but not all of the correct ones.

Ash, can you verify that this is no longer an issue using a Nightly build?

I did a quick check with process monitor:
- I'm not able to exploit the updater with the service
- I'm certain I will be able to exploit the updater if I place the dll to "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Nightly\updates\0" during an update without the service. Not with the poc dll, because the poc dll isn't acting like a proxy dll so the updater crashes.
By the way the elevated updater tries to load serveral .dll files from the current dirctory (mpr.dll, apphelp.dll propsys.dll, ntmarta.dll).
Are there any good reasons why the load of dlls with the updater.exe is delayed at all?

Can you make sure, though? Just trying to be complete here.

Progress:
Went through all the available platforms that I have available and compiled a list of unknown DLL's using the following steps:
Installed the latest Nightly build from the following location:
<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2013-04-18-03-10-48-mozilla-central/>
Once the Nightly build has been installed, went through the following steps:
1) Ran "Procmon.exe" as an Administrator and used the following settings:
- Process Name is updater.exe
- Path contains .dll
- Operation is Load Image
2) Went into the appropriate folder where Nightly was installed and ran "updater.exe" as Administrator
3) Compared the DLL's listed in Step #1 to DLL's listed in "Winobj.exe" (KnownDlls/KnownDlls32)

I have created a new poc dll which executes a elevated calc.exe during an update without the service. I have tested the new poc with the last nightly build.
Put the new poc profapi.dll to "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Nightly\updates\0" and do
an update to verify. (the first pop up of the calc.exe will be unelevated the second will be elevated)

Went through all of the unknown DLL's that have been listed in [Comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=859072#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the profapi.dll from the update directory") and ran them through the POC2 that has been attached in [Comment 20](/show_bug.cgi?id=859072#c20 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the profapi.dll from the update directory")
Used the following build:
<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2013-04-25-03-08-45-mozilla-central/>
Went through the following steps:
- Placed the updater.exe next to the POC2 DLL that has been attached and then ran updater.exe as "Administrator" using the right click method
- Renamed the POC2 DLL to all of the unknown DLL's in [Comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=859072#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the profapi.dll from the update directory") and ran them next to the updater.exe on all of the platforms (monitored Process Explorer at the same time)
- The POC does not reproduce with the Mozilla Maintenance Service but it does if you click on yes on the Mozilla UAC prompt

Without the maintenance service the user would expect to have to click on UAC to perform an install so that's not much mitigation. In what situations would users not have the maintenance service but still get a UAC?Flags: needinfo?(netzen)Keywords: [sec-vector](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-vector&resolution=---)Whiteboard: introduced by Win7, affects Win8 as well

The point of my question is that I think for truly limited accounts who cannot write to the Firefox install location we abort the update anyway. The update runs and shows the UAC prompt only if the user can otherwise write to the Firefox install location. In that case an attacker could just add a component or something to Firefox itself to be run later. Is this really a sec-high attack or a more moderate spoofing-equivalent one?

In these situations:
- At install time a user can choose to not install the maintenance service.
- Users can pref off the maintenance service from the checkbox in options or about config.
- An unprivileged process could disable the service via setting the pref in the user's app profile dir to not use the service.
- A user has more than 10 errors with the service so it gets disabled
From telemetry data we know that:
95.9% of users have the service installed
99.7% of users have the service enabled (people that don't have it installed are counted as having it on because of the pref check)
0% of users have more than 2 errors with the servicce
1.84% of users onec had it installed but later uninstalled it
I think we can call an update exploit equally as critical since an unelevated process account can disable service via a pref.Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

Does that mean we copy updater.exe to that directory before running it? I guess that's the root of the problem here then -- malware could copy the dll there and wait for a legitimate update which the user would approve. I'm assuming a situation where malware can't write directly to the Firefox install directory because if it can all bets are off. Of course if it can write into the profile it can install add-ons so that's pretty bad, too.

Yes we copy the updater there because we need to replace it during an update.
The maintenance service then re-copies it out of there to a secure location before executing it.

Attached patch

[Patch v1.](attachment.cgi?id=764729&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=764729&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=859072&attachment=764729)

I'm going to file a followup that will try to fix this type of problem in general for updater.exe. In particular it would exclusively lock every .dll in the current directory from the unelevated updater.exe before elevating it.
This patch should fix the problems found by Kamil in [Comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=859072#c21 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the profapi.dll from the update directory").
I tested this with all mentioned DLLs on Windows 8x64.
userenv.dll was already in the list but was being loaded before the program started. We've had a similar situation to this in the past and I explicitly specify to delay load that DLL in the Makefile. I tested and it's working now.

Patch v1.
This request is to push to try and m-i.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Easily if the user has access to the physical machine.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
It's pretty easy to deduce based on the surrounding comment.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
I think all
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
n/a.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
other branches should use the same patch if this is uplifted.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely, try builds should catch any regressions.

My apologies for the spam, but think it was easier splitting each comment for each build or it would have been hard to go through one giant comment.

Hi Kamil, it's good the cmds are not spawned anymore.
I did verify each DLL that was producing the error on the fixed build but only on win8x4, which you confirmed has no errors. I think it's best for us to try to get rid of the dll errors on other Windows versions though too, although it may just be best to do a blanket fix for all DLLs at this point.
Could you post a new bug in the meantime for the dlls that reproduce the errors? I guess just one new bug with the dlls mentioned in the last few comments that reproduce the errors and on which OS. Thanks!

### Description

Security researcher **Ash** reported an issue with the Mozilla
Updater on Windows 7 and later versions of Windows. On vulnerable platforms, the
Mozilla Updater can be made to load a specific malicious DLL file from the local
system. This DLL file can run in a privileged context through the Mozilla
Maintenance Service's privileges, allowing for local privilege escalation. The
DLL file can also run in an unprivileged context if the Mozilla Updater is run
directly by a user in the same directory as the file. Local file system access
is necessary in order for this issue to be exploitable.
