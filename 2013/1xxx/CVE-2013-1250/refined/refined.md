  "CVE-2013-1250": {
    "Description": "The provided documents describe a race condition vulnerability in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) that could allow elevation of privileges. The vulnerability is triggered by improper handling of objects in memory.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from a race condition in how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Improper memory handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to run a specially crafted application."
