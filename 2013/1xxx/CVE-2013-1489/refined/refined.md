    "ID": "CVE-2013-1489",
    "content": "The provided content discusses a vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 10 and 11, where the security level setting in the browser plugin can be bypassed. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability**:  The vulnerability stems from how Java Applets are instantiated via serialization. The security checks performed when loading an applet using the 'code' attribute are not performed when using the 'object' attribute, which specifies a serialized representation of an applet's state.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Bypass of the Java Control Panel's security settings (Low, Medium, High, Very High)\n*   Lack of security checks during applet instantiation via deserialization. The `fireAppletSSVValidation` method, which conducts security checks related to the configured security level, is not called during deserialization of applets.\n*   Ability to execute unsigned Java code without prompting the user, even when the security setting is set to 'Very High'.\n\n**Impact of exploitation**:\n*   Remote execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.\n*   Silent exploitation of Java applets without user authorization. Attackers can bypass the Java security prompt and silently execute malicious code.\n\n**Attack vectors**:\n*   Visiting a specially crafted HTML document containing malicious Java applet. \n*   Compromised websites hosting malicious Java applets (drive-by-downloads).\n*   Utilizing the object attribute to specify a serialized applet state, bypassing security level checks.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position**:\n*   Ability to create and host a malicious HTML document with a crafted Java applet.\n*   Ability to convince a user to visit a malicious website or a compromised website hosting a malicious applet.\n*   Knowledge of using the `object` attribute for applet instantiation via deserialization.",
