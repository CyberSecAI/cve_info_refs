# [SE-2012-01] An issue with new Java SE 7 security features

---

*From*: Security Explorations <contact () security-explorations com>

*Date*: Sun, 27 Jan 2013 11:01:50 +0100

```

Hello All,

According to Oracle's Java security head, the company has
recently made "very significant" security improvements to
Java, such as to prevent silent exploits. The problem is
that "people don't understand those features yet" [1].

Starting from Java SE 7 Update 10 released in Oct 2012, a
user may control the level of security that will be used
when running unsigned Java apps in a web browser [2][3].
Apart from being able to completely disable Java content
in the browser, the following four security levels can be
used for the configuration of unsigned Java applications:
- Low
   Most unsigned Java apps in the browser will run without
   prompting unless they request access to a specific old
   version of JRE or to protected resources on the system.
- Medium Unsigned Java apps in the browser will run without
   prompting only if the Java version is considered secure.
   User will be prompted if an unsigned app requests to run
   on an old version of Java.
- High
   User will be prompted before any unsigned Java app runs in
   the browser. If the JRE is below the security baseline,
   user will be given an option to update.
- Very High
   Unsigned (sandboxed) apps will not run.

Unfortunately, the above is only a theory. In practice, it
is possible to execute an unsigned (and malicious!) Java
code without a prompt corresponding to security settings
configured in Java Control Panel.

What we found out and what is a subject of a new security
vulnerability (Issue 53) is that unsigned Java code can be
successfully executed on a target Windows system regardless
of the four Java Control Panel settings described above.
Our Proof of Concept code that illustrates Issue 53 has been
successfully executed in the environment of latest Java SE
7 Update 11 (JRE version 1.7.0_11-b21) under Windows 7 OS
and with "Very High" Java Control Panel security settings.

That said, recently made security "improvements" to Java
SE 7 software don't prevent silent exploits at all. Users
that require Java content in the web browser need to rely
on a Click to Play technology implemented by several web
browser vendors in order to mitigate the risk of a silent
Java Plugin exploit.

Thank you.

Best Regards
Adam Gowdiak

## Oracle Java contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#858729

Original Release Date: 2013-02-01 | Last Revised: 2013-06-14

---

### Overview

Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier versions of Java contain vulnerabilities that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows users to run Java applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Oracle has made the JRE available for multiple operating systems.  The Java JRE plug-in provides its own [Security Manager](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29). Typically, a web applet runs with a security manager provided by the browser or Java Web Start plugin. Oracle's document [states](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29), *"If there is a security manager already installed, this method first calls the security manager's* *checkPermission* *method with a* *RuntimePermission("setSecurityManager")* *permission to ensure it's safe to replace the existing security manager. This may result in throwing a* *SecurityException"**.* By leveraging a number of vulnerabilities, an untrusted Java applet can escalate its privileges to allow full privileges, without requiring code signing. Other vulnerabilities can cause exploitable memory corruption, which could affect Java applets, as well as Java applications, depending on what the Java application does and how it may process untrusted data. Oracle Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier Java versions are affected.At least one of these vulnerabilities is reportedly being exploited in the wild. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Note that applications that use the Internet Explorer web content rendering components, such as Microsoft Office or Windows Desktop Search, may also be used as an attack vector for these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities that affect server deployments of Java may be exploited by causing a Java server application to process untrusted data. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These issues are addressed in Java 7 Update 13 and Java 6 Update 39. Please see the [Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) - February 2013 for more details. |
| --- |

| **Disable Java in web browsers**Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to [disable Java content in web browsers](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml) through the Java control panel applet. Please see the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable) for more details.System administrators wishing to deploy Java 7 Update 10 or later with the "Enable Java content in the browser" feature disabled can invoke the Java installer with the WEB\_JAVA=0 command-line option. More details are available in the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#install).Alternatively, Microsoft has released a [Fix it](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/05/29/java-when-you-cannot-let-go.aspx) that disables Java in the Internet Explorer web browser.**Restrict access to Java applets**Network administrators unable to disable Java in web browsers may be able to help mitigate this and other Java vulnerabilities by restricting access to Java applets. This may be accomplished by using proxy server rules, for example. Blocking or whitelisting web requests to .jar and .class files can help to prevent Java from being used by untrusted sources. Filtering requests that contain a Java User-Agent header may also be effective. For example, this technique can be used in environments where Java is required on the local intranet. The proxy can be configured to allow Java requests locally, but block them when the destination is a site on the internet. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-31 16:28:56 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2013-1489](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1489) to the following vulnerability:  Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 10 and Update 11 (JRE 1.7.0_11-b21) and possibly other versions, when running on Windows using Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Google Chrome, allows remote attackers to bypass the "Very High" security level of the Java Control Panel and execute unsigned Java code without prompting the user via unknown vectors, aka "Issue 53." NOTE: as of 20130130, this vulnerability does not contain any independently-verifiable details, and there is no vendor acknowledgement. A CVE identifier is being assigned because this vulnerability is receiving significant public attention, and the original researcher has an established history of releasing vulnerability reports that have been fixed by vendors.

IcedTea-Web plugin for OpenJDK does not currently offer similar security feature.  Additionally, according to the limited information in the public report, this problem is about bypassing Security Level protection, and it is not a Java sandbox restriction.  Hence this needs to be combined with other flaw to achieve code execution.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-01 21:10:01 UTC  ``` This issue is now fixed in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 13, including the following note:    This issue ([CVE-2013-1489](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1489)) has been discussed publicly and is sometimes known   as the "Java Security Slider vulnerability". It has a CVSS of 0 because it   does not directly result in an exploitation, but may be combined with other   vulnerabilities to allow blind exploitation. When the Security Slider is set   to the default (high) all unsigned applets must be authorized via a dialog   box by a browser user in order to execute. This provides the browser operator   the opportunity to prevent execution of suspicious applets that may result in   successful exploits. However, when [CVE-2013-1489](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1489) is combined with   vulnerabilities that can be used to cause direct impacts, the effect can be   that the impact can be caused "silently" without the authorization dialog box.  External Reference:  <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-04 17:23:10 UTC  ``` Additional details from Adam Gowdiak of Security Explorations:  <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Feb/12>    [Issue 53]   Issue 53 stems from the fact that Oracle's implementation of new   security levels introduced by the company in Java SE 7 Update 10   did not take into account the fact that Applets can be instantiated   with the use of serialization. Such a possibility is indicated both   in HTML 4 Specification [5] as well as in Oracle's code.      HTML 4 Specification contains the following description for the   "object" attribute of APPLET element:      object = cdata [CS]           This attribute names a resource containing a serialized           representation of an applet's state. It is interpreted           relative to the applet's codebase. The serialized data           contains the applet's class name but not the implementation.           The class name is used to retrieve the implementation from           a class file or archive.      Additionally, Java 7 Update 10 (and 11) reveal the following code   logic when it comes to the implementation of new security features   (Java Control Panel security levels).      [excerpt from sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2Manager class]               String object_attr = getSerializedObject();            String code_attr   = getCode();            ...               if(code_attr != null) {                Class class1 = plugin2classloader.loadCode(code_attr);                ...                if(class1 != null)                       if (fireAppletSSVValidation())                    ...            } else {                if(!isSecureVM)                    return;       adapter.instantiateSerialApplet(plugin2classloader,object_attr);                ...            }      The above clearly shows that the conditional block implementing   Applet instantiation via deserialization does not contain a call   to fireAppletSSVValidation method. This method conducts important   security checks corresponding to security levels configured by   Java Control Panel. The lack of a call to security checking method   is equivalent to "no protection at all" as it allows for a silent   Java exploit in particular.      What's worth mentioning is that for Google Chrome the following   HTML sequence needed to be used to activate target Applet code:      <object type="application/x-java-applet" object="BlackBox.ser">    [5] HTML 4 Specification, Including an applet: the APPLET element   <http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#h-13.4>  Original report: <http://www.security-explorations.com/materials/SE-2012-01-ORACLE-9.pdf>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:54:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0237 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0237.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-06 08:24:42 UTC  ``` Nico Waisman's (Immunity) blog post detailing this issue, with the same finding as posted by Adam Gowdiak ([comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c3)):  <http://immunityproducts.blogspot.com/2013/02/keep-calm-and-run-this-applet.html>   ``` |  |

# New vulnerability bypasses Oracle’s attempt to stop malware drive-by-downloads via Java applets

January 28, 2013 - 8:39 pm

![New vulnerability bypasses Oracle’s attempt to stop malware drive-by-downloads via Java applets]()
![New vulnerability bypasses Oracle’s attempt to stop malware drive-by-downloads via Java applets](https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image?fit=1280%2C720&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2013%2F01%2F1353629_43251501.jpg&signature=b82fd16fa523bdb66a319357c2d29752)

Researchers from the Polish firm [Security Explorations](http://www.security-explorations.com) have identified a serious vulnerability in the latest version of Java that completely bypasses the new security level Oracle recently introduced for Java applets. Coupled with the [two other vulnerabilities](https://thenextweb.com/news/oracle-investigating-two-new-vulnerabilities-in-latest-java-but-windows-users-have-less-to-fear) discovered by the same firm less than two weeks ago, Java users are once again as vulnerable as they were before the latest update.

Some background is required. As we noted [when Java 7 Update 11 was released](https://thenextweb.com/news/oracle-ships-java-7-update-11-with-vulnerability-fixes-increased-security-level-for-java-applets), Oracle changed the default Java Security Level setting from Medium to High, meaning the user is now always prompted before any unsigned Java applet or Java Web Start application is run. This is to prevent drive-by-downloads, as Oracle explains:

> This affects the conditions under which unsigned (sandboxed) Java web applications can run. Previously, as long as you had the latest secure Java release installed applets and web start applications would continue to run as always. With the “High” setting the user is always warned before any unsigned application is run to prevent silent exploitation.

When the last two Java vulnerabilities were discovered, Security Explorations CEO Adam Gowdiak told us that the new protective layer, available only on Microsoft’s operating system, was working as expected. Yet Gowdiak recently discovered a way to circumvent the protection, according to a [Full Disclosure post](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Jan/241) he made last night:

> What we found out and what is a subject of a new security vulnerability (Issue 53) is that unsigned Java code can be successfully executed on a target Windows system regardless of the four Java Control Panel settings described above. Our Proof of Concept code that illustrates Issue 53 has been successfully executed in the environment of latest Java SE 7 Update 11 (JRE version 1.7.0\_11-b21) under Windows 7 OS and with “Very High” Java Control Panel security settings.
>
> That said, recently made security “improvements” to Java SE 7 software don’t prevent silent exploits at all. Users that require Java content in the web browser need to rely on a Click to Play technology implemented by several web browser vendors in order to mitigate the risk of a silent Java Plugin exploit.

The click-to-play functionality Gowdiak is referring to was introduced [in Firefox 17](https://thenextweb.com/news/firefox-17-launches-with-click-to-play-plugin-blocks-for-old-adobe-reader-flash-and-silverlight). When the latest Java vulnerability craziness happened earlier this month, Mozilla added all recent versions of Java to its Firefox add-on blocklist and Apple did the same [to protect Mac users](https://thenextweb.com/news/apple-takes-no-prisoners-immediately-blocks-java-7-on-os-x-10-6-and-up-to-protect-mac-users).

Unfortunately, that was before the release of Java 7 Update 11. With these latest vulnerabilities, all Java users are just as vulnerable as before. The only good news here is that there have yet to be reports of exploits in the wild for these latest security holes.

Unfortunately, only then will we see action from Oracle, as well as companies like Apple and Mozilla looking to protect their customers. We’re hoping Oracle can get Java 7 Update 12 out before history repeats itself once again.

We have contacted Oracle about this latest discovery. We will update this article if we hear back.

Alert
# Oracle Java Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedOctober 19, 2016
Alert CodeTA13-032A

### Systems Affected

Any system using Oracle Java including

* JDK and JRE 7 Update 11 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 6 Update 38 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 38 and earlier
* SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_40 and earlier
* JavaFX 2.2.4 and earlier
* Java 1.6.0\_37 and earlier for Mac OS X and OS X Server 10.6.8

Web browsers using the Java plug-in are at high risk.

### Overview

Multiple vulnerabilities in Java could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

The Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory for [February 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Both Java applets delivered via web browsers and stand-alone Java applications are affected, however web browsers using the Java plug-in are at particularly high risk.

The Java plug-in, the Java Deployment Toolkit plug-in, and Java Web Start can be used as attack vectors. An attacker could use social engineering techniques to entice a user to visit a link to a website hosting a malicious Java applet. An attacker could also compromise a legitimate web site and upload a malicious Java applet (a "drive-by download" attack).

Some vulnerabilities affect stand-alone Java applications, depending on how the Java application functions and how it processes untrusted data.

Reports indicate that at least one of these vulnerabilities is being actively exploited.

Further technical details are available in Vulnerability Note [VU#858729](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/858729).

### Impact

By convincing a user to load a malicious Java applet or Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the Java plug-in process.

Stand-alone java applications may also be affected.

### Solution

**Update Java**

The Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory for [February 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) states that Java 7 Update 13 and Java 6 Update 39 address these vulnerabilities.

**Disable Java in web browsers**

These and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered. To defend against this and future Java vulnerabilities, consider disabling Java in web browsers until adequate updates have been installed. As with any software, unnecessary features should be disabled or removed as appropriate for your environment.

Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to disable Java content in web browsers through the Java control panel applet. From [Setting the Security Level of the Java Client](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable):

For installations where the highest level of security is required, it is possible to entirely prevent *any* Java apps (signed or unsigned) from running in a browser by de-selecting Enable Java content in the browser in the Java Control Panel under the Security tab.

If you are unable to update to Java 7 Update 13 please see the solution section of Vulnerability Note [VU#636312](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312#solution) for instructions on how to disable Java on a per-browser basis.

**Restrict access to Java applets**

Network administrators unable to disable Java in web browsers may be able to help mitigate these and other Java vulnerabilities by restricting access to Java applets [using a web proxy](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2012/11/do-devs-care-about-java-insecurity.html?showComment=1353874245992#c4794680666510382012). Most web proxies have features that can be used to block or whitelist requests for `.jar` and `.class` files based on network location. Filtering requests that contain a Java User-Agent header may also be effective. For environments where Java is required on the local intranet, the proxy can be configured to allow access to Java applets hosted locally, but block access to Java applets on the internet.

# Java update 'doesn't prevent silent exploits at all'

Holes still exist in Oracle's Java software that could potentially leave machines open to remote execution of malicious code, according to a researcher.
  ![ben-woods.jpg](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/aa9a3a2e8acee46cd444ce397f4de9908897c475/2014/07/22/734fe893-1175-11e4-9732-00505685119a/ben-woods.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&frame=1&height=192&width=192) Written by [Ben Woods, Contributor](/meet-the-team/ben-woods/)  Jan. 28, 2013 at 7:07 a.m. PT

An update for Java Standard Edition 7 (SE7) - which was supposed to fix a high-profile critical vulnerability that left machines susceptible to remote exploits - has failed to solve all the issues with the software, leaving the door open to further attacks.

### Cloud security: How to make the switch

Read now](/article/cloud-security-how-to-make-the-switch/)

The zero-day vulnerability, uncovered in January, was widely reported to have been exploited in the wild, leading [Homeland Security in the US to recommend disabling Java altogether](/article/homeland-security-warns-to-disable-java-amid-zero-day-flaw/). Following the bad press, Oracle quickly rolled out a fix for the issue in the form of Java SE7 Update 11.

However, Adam Gowdiak, a researcher from Security Explorations, [said on the Full Disclosure](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Jan/241) mailing list on Sunday that there is another vulnerability in Java that allows remote execution of malicious code - that is, the running of unsigned Java content in a web page.

"What we found out and what is a subject of a new security vulnerability (Issue 53) is that unsigned Java code can be successfully executed on a target Windows system regardless of the four Java Control Panel settings," Gowdiak wrote.

The four Java control panel settings are security settings introduced in Java SE7 Update 10 in October 2012 to control the access unsigned Java apps have to the system. It allows a user to set Java's web security as low, medium, high or very high. A setting of 'very high' means that unsigned apps should not run outside of the sandbox environment, which in theory protects the user from any potential threats.

"Issue 53 has been successfully executed in the environment of latest Java SE 7 Update 11 (JRE version 1.7.0\_11-b21) under Windows 7 OS and with 'Very High' Java Control Panel security settings," Gowdiak wrote in the disclosure. "Recently made security 'improvements' to Java SE 7 software don't prevent silent exploits at all," he added.

Java is often a high-profile target for malicious software makers and online ne'er-do-wells as it has such a large install base (it is currently in use on more than 850 million PCs and Macs) and frequent critically rated security vulnerabilities.
