    "description": "This update of libXvMC fixes several integer overflow issues.\n- integer overflow in XvMCListSurfaceTypes(), XvMCListSubpictureTypes() [CVE-2013-1990]",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in `XvMCListSurfaceTypes()` and `XvMCListSubpictureTypes()` functions due to lack of bounds checking before multiplying by sizes of structures to calculate total memory to be allocated.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Integer overflow can lead to underallocation of memory, and subsequent writing of data past the end of the allocated buffer.",

      "Malicious or compromised X server sending specially crafted responses to a client application using libXvMC"
