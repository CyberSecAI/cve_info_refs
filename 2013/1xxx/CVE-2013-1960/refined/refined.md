This vulnerability occurs when processing a malformed TIFF file with specific image-length and resolution values, potentially leading to a crash. The vulnerability occurs when writing TIFF image content into a PDF document file. \n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow due to malformed image length and resolution values when writing to a PDF file during TIFF to PDF conversion\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack-based buffer overflow.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Exploitation leads to a crash of the tiff2pdf executable. With FORTIFY_SOURCE the impact is limited to DoS and no arbitrary code execution.\n\nAttack vectors: A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a specially-crafted TIFF image file to be processed by the tiff2pdf tool.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted TIFF file to be processed by the vulnerable tool.",
