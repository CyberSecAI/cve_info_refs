The provided content relates to CVE-2013-1443.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Django authentication framework, specifically the password hashing process, is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The default password hasher, PBKDF2, is computationally expensive, and Django does not limit the length of plaintext passwords. An attacker can submit arbitrarily large passwords, forcing the server to perform resource-intensive hash computations, thereby leading to a DoS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of a maximum password length limit
- Computational expense of the PBKDF2 password hashing algorithm

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service by exhausting server resources (CPU)
- Tying up server resources in expensive hash computations

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending repeated login requests with excessively large passwords

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send login requests to the Django application's authentication endpoint. No authentication is required.
