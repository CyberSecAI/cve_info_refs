Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** A classic buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Ubiquiti airCam RTSP service ('ubnt-streamer') when parsing the URI of a RTSP request message.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow (CWE-120). The service fails to properly validate the length of the URI provided in an RTSP request, allowing an attacker to write past the boundaries of a designated buffer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable device. As demonstrated in the provided GDB session, the overflow overwrites the return address, allowing the attacker to redirect code execution to a location of their choice (in this case 0x12345678).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted RTSP request containing an oversized URI.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send RTSP requests to the vulnerable service (network access). The exploit is remotely exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Ubiquiti airCam models: airCam, airCam Mini, and airCam Dome with firmware version 1.1.5.
*   Firmware versions 1.2.0 (airVision 2.x platform) and 1.1.6 (airVision 1.x platform) are not vulnerable.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger the buffer overflow by sending an RTSP DESCRIBE request with a long, crafted URI.
*   The overflow can overwrite the return address on the stack.
*   The provided GDB session shows the overwritten return address (`pc 0x12345678`). It also shows stack corruption (`0x40a7ea70: 0x41414141...`) demonstrating the buffer overflow.
