## Details

Mitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi discovered that PostgreSQL

incorrectly handled certain connection requests containing database names

starting with a dash. A remote attacker could use this flaw to damage or

destroy files within a server's data directory. This issue only applied to

Ubuntu 11.10, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2013-1899](/security/CVE-2013-1899))

Marko Kreen discovered that PostgreSQL incorrectly generated random

numbers. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to possibly guess

another database user's random numbers. ([CVE-2013-1900](/security/CVE-2013-1900))

Noah Misch discovered that PostgreSQL incorrectly handled certain privilege

checks. An unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to possibly interfere

with in-progress backups. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 11.10,

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2013-1901](/security/CVE-2013-1901))

openSUSE Security Update: postgresql91 to version 9.1.9.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2013:0627-1
Rating: important
References: #812525
Cross-References: CVE-2013-1899 CVE-2013-1900 CVE-2013-1901
Affected Products:
openSUSE 12.2
openSUSE 12.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
postgresql was updated to version 9.1.9 (bnc#812525):
\* CVE-2013-1899: Fix insecure parsing of server
command-line switches. A connection request containing
a database name that begins with "-" could be crafted
to damage or destroy files within the server's data
directory, even if the request is eventually rejected.
\* CVE-2013-1900: Reset OpenSSL randomness state in each
postmaster child process. This avoids a scenario
wherein random numbers generated by "contrib/pgcrypto"
functions might be relatively easy for another database
user to guess. The risk is only significant when the
postmaster is configured with ssl = on but most
connections don't use SSL encryption.
\* CVE-2013-1901: Make REPLICATION privilege checks test
current user not authenticated user. An unprivileged
database user could exploit this mistake to call
pg\_start\_backup() or pg\_stop\_backup(), thus possibly
interfering with creation of routine backups.
\* See the release notes for the rest of the changes:
<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/release-9-1-9.html>

# PostgreSQL 9.2.4, 9.1.9, 9.0.13 and 8.4.17 released

Posted on **2013-04-04** by PostgreSQL Global Development Group

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released a security update to all current versions of the PostgreSQL database system, including versions 9.2.4, 9.1.9, 9.0.13, and 8.4.17. This update fixes a high-exposure security vulnerability in versions 9.0 and later. All users of the affected versions are strongly urged to apply the update *immediately*.

A major security issue fixed in this release, [CVE-2013-1899](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1899), makes it possible for a connection request containing a database name that begins with "-" to be crafted that can damage or destroy files within a server's data directory. Anyone with access to the port the PostgreSQL server listens on can initiate this request. This issue was discovered by Mitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi of NTT Open Source Software Center.

Two lesser security fixes are also included in this release: [CVE-2013-1900](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1900), wherein random numbers generated by contrib/pgcrypto functions may be easy for another database user to guess, and [CVE-2013-1901](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1901), which mistakenly allows an unprivileged user to run commands that could interfere with in-progress backups. Finally, this release fixes two security issues with the graphical installers for Linux and Mac OS X: insecure passing of superuser passwords to a script, [CVE-2013-1903](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1903) and the use of predictable filenames in /tmp [CVE-2013-1902](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1902). Marko Kreen, Noah Misch and Stefan Kaltenbrunner reported these issues, respectively.

We are grateful for each developer's efforts in making PostgreSQL more secure.

This release also corrects several errors in management of GiST indexes. After installing this update, it is advisable to REINDEX any GiST indexes that meet one or more of the conditions described below.

This update release also contains fixes for many minor issues discovered and patched by the PostgreSQL community in the last two months, including:

* Fix GiST indexes to not use "fuzzy" geometric comparisons for box, polygon, circle, and point columns
* Fix bugs in contrib/btree\_gist for GiST indexes on text, bytea, bit, and numeric columns
* Fix bugs in page splitting code for multi-column GiST indexes
* Fix buffer leak in WAL replay causing "incorrect local pin count" errors
* Ensure crash recovery before entering archive recovery during unclean shutdown when recovery.conf is present
* Avoid deleting not-yet-archived WAL files during crash recovery
* Fix race condition in DELETE RETURNING
* Fix possible planner crash after adding columns to a view depending on another view
* Eliminate memory leaks in PL/Perl's spi\_prepare() function
* Fix pg\_dumpall to handle database names containing "=" correctly
* Avoid crash in pg\_dump when an incorrect connection string is given
* Ignore invalid indexes in pg\_dump and pg\_upgrade
* Include only the current server version's subdirectory when backing up a tablespace with pg\_basebackup
* Add a server version check in pg\_basebackup and pg\_receivexlog
* Fix contrib/dblink to handle inconsistent settings of DateStyle or IntervalStyle safely
* Fix contrib/pg\_trgm's similarity() function to return zero for trigram-less strings
* Enable building PostgreSQL with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
* Update time zone data files for DST law changes in Chile, Haiti, Morocco, Paraguay, and some Russian areas

As always, update releases only require installation of packages and a database system restart. You do not need to dump/restore or use pg\_upgrade for this update release. Users who have skipped multiple update releases may need to perform additional, post-update steps; see the Release Notes for details.

# E.21. Release 9.2.4

**Release date:** 2013-04-04

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.2.3. For
information about new features in the 9.2 major release, see
[Section E.25](release-9-2.html).

## E.21.1. Migration to Version 9.2.4

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.2.X.

However, this release corrects several errors in management
of GiST indexes. After installing this update, it is advisable
to REINDEX any GiST indexes that meet
one or more of the conditions described below.

Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than
9.2.2, see [Section E.23](release-9-2-2.html).

## E.21.2. Changes

* Fix insecure parsing of server command-line switches
  (Mitsumasa Kondo, Kyotaro Horiguchi)

  A connection request containing a database name that
  begins with "-" could be crafted to damage or
  destroy files within the server's data directory, even if
  the request is eventually rejected. (CVE-2013-1899)
* Reset OpenSSL randomness state in each postmaster child
  process (Marko Kreen)

  This avoids a scenario wherein random numbers generated
  by contrib/pgcrypto functions
  might be relatively easy for another database user to
  guess. The risk is only significant when the postmaster is
  configured with ssl = on but most connections don't use SSL
  encryption. (CVE-2013-1900)
* Make REPLICATION privilege checks test current user not
  authenticated user (Noah Misch)

  An unprivileged database user could exploit this mistake
  to call `pg_start_backup()` or
  `pg_stop_backup()`, thus
  possibly interfering with creation of routine backups.
  (CVE-2013-1901)
* Fix GiST indexes to not use "fuzzy" geometric comparisons when it's not
  appropriate to do so (Alexander Korotkov)

  The core geometric types perform comparisons using
  "fuzzy" equality, but
  `gist_box_same` must do exact
  comparisons, else GiST indexes using it might become
  inconsistent. After installing this update, users should
  REINDEX any GiST indexes on
  box, polygon,
  circle, or point columns, since all of these use
  `gist_box_same`.
* Fix erroneous range-union and penalty logic in GiST
  indexes that use contrib/btree\_gist for variable-width data
  types, that is text, bytea, bit, and
  numeric columns (Tom Lane)

  These errors could result in inconsistent indexes in
  which some keys that are present would not be found by
  searches, and also in useless index bloat. Users are
  advised to REINDEX such indexes
  after installing this update.
* Fix bugs in GiST page splitting code for multi-column
  indexes (Tom Lane)

  These errors could result in inconsistent indexes in
  which some keys that are present would not be found by
  searches, and also in indexes that are unnecessarily
  inefficient to search. Users are advised to REINDEX multi-column GiST indexes after
  installing this update.
* Fix `gist_point_consistent`
  to handle fuzziness consistently (Alexander Korotkov)

  Index scans on GiST indexes on point columns would sometimes yield results
  different from a sequential scan, because `gist_point_consistent` disagreed with the
  underlying operator code about whether to do comparisons
  exactly or fuzzily.
* Fix buffer leak in WAL replay (Heikki Linnakangas)

  This bug could result in "incorrect
  local pin count" errors during replay, making
  recovery impossible.
* Ensure we do crash recovery before entering archive
  recovery, if the database was not stopped cleanly and a
  recovery.conf file is present
  (Heikki Linnakangas, Kyotaro Horiguchi, Mitsumasa
  Kondo)

  This is needed to ensure that the database is consistent
  in certain scenarios, such as initializing a standby server
  with a filesystem snapshot from a running server.
* Avoid deleting not-yet-archived WAL files during crash
  recovery (Heikki Linnakangas, Fujii Masao)
* Fix race condition in DELETE
  RETURNING (Tom Lane)

  Under the right circumstances, DELETE RETURNING could attempt to fetch data
  from a shared buffer that the current process no longer has
  any pin on. If some other process changed the buffer
  meanwhile, this would lead to garbage RETURNING output, or even a crash.
* Fix infinite-loop risk in regular expression compilation
  (Tom Lane, Don Porter)
* Fix potential null-pointer dereference in regular
  expression compilation (Tom Lane)
* Fix `to_char()` to use
  ASCII-only case-folding rules where appropriate (Tom
  Lane)

  This fixes misbehavior of some template patterns that
  should be locale-independent, but mishandled "I" and
  "i" in
  Turkish locales.
* Fix unwanted rejection of timestamp 1999-12-31 24:00:00 (Tom Lane)
* Fix SQL-language functions to be safely usable as
  support functions for range types (Tom Lane)
* Fix logic error when a single transaction does
  UNLISTEN then LISTEN (Tom Lane)

  The session wound up not listening for notify events at
  all, though it surely should listen in this case.
* Fix possible planner crash after columns have been added
  to a view that's depended on by another view (Tom Lane)
* Fix performance issue in EXPLAIN
  (ANALYZE, TIMING OFF) (Pavel Stehule)
* Remove useless "picksplit doesn't
  support secondary split" log messages (Josh Hansen,
  Tom Lane)

  This message seems to have been added in expectation of
  code that was never written, and probably never will be,
  since GiST's default handling of secondary splits is
  actually pretty good. So stop nagging end users about
  it.
* Remove vestigial secondary-split support in `gist_box_picksplit()` (Tom Lane)

  Not only was this implementation of secondary-split not
  better than the default implementation, it's actually
  worse. So remove it and let the default code path handle
  the case.
* Fix possible failure to send a session's last few
  transaction commit/abort counts to the statistics collector
  (Tom Lane)
* Eliminate memory leaks in PL/Perl's `spi_prepare()` function (Alex Hunsaker,
  Tom Lane)
* Fix pg\_dumpall to
  handle database names containing "=" correctly
  (Heikki Linnakangas)
* Avoid crash in pg\_dump
  when an incorrect connection string is given (Heikki
  Linnakangas)
* Ignore invalid indexes in pg\_dump and pg\_upgrade (Michael Paquier, Bruce
  Momjian)

  Dumping invalid indexes can cause problems at restore
  time, for example if the reason the index creation failed
  was because it tried to enforce a uniqueness condition not
  satisfied by the table's data. Also, if the index creation
  is in fact still in progress, it seems reasonable to
  consider it to be an uncommitted DDL change, which
  pg\_dump wouldn't be
  expected to dump anyway. pg\_upgrade now also skips invalid
  indexes rather than failing.
* In pg\_basebackup,
  include only the current server version's subdirectory when
  backing up a tablespace (Heikki Linnakangas)
* Add a server version check in pg\_basebackup and pg\_receivexlog, so they fail cleanly
  with version combinations that won't work (Heikki
  Linnakangas)
* Fix contrib/dblink to handle
  inconsistent settings of DateStyle
  or IntervalStyle safely (Daniel
  Farina, Tom Lane)

  Previously, if the remote server had different settings
  of these parameters, ambiguous dates might be read
  incorrectly. This fix ensures that datetime and interval
  columns fetched by a dblink query
  will be interpreted correctly. Note however that
  inconsistent settings are still risky, since literal values
  appearing in SQL commands sent to the remote server might
  be interpreted differently than they would be locally.
* Fix contrib/pg\_trgm's
  `similarity()` function to
  return zero for trigram-less strings (Tom Lane)

  Previously it returned NaN due
  to internal division by zero.
* Enable building PostgreSQL with Microsoft Visual
  Studio 2012 (Brar Piening, Noah Misch)
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2013b for DST law
  changes in Chile, Haiti, Morocco, Paraguay, and some
  Russian areas. Also, historical zone data corrections for
  numerous places.

  Also, update the time zone abbreviation files for recent
  changes in Russia and elsewhere: CHOT, GET,
  IRKT, KGT, KRAT,
  MAGT, MAWT, MSK,
  NOVT, OMST, TKT,
  VLAT, WST, YAKT,
  YEKT now follow their current
  meanings, and VOLT
  (Europe/Volgograd) and MIST
  (Antarctica/Macquarie) are added to the default
  abbreviations list.

CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1899 CVE-2013-1900 CVE-2013-1901
Debian Bug     : 704479

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in PostgreSQL database server.

CVE-2013-1899

    Mitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi of NTT Open Source Software Center
    discovered that it was possible for a connection request containing a
    database name that begins with "-" to be crafted that can damage or destroy
    files within a server's data directory. Anyone with access to the port the
    PostgreSQL server listens on can initiate this request.

CVE-2013-1900

    Random numbers generated by contrib/pgcrypto functions may be easy for
    another database user to guess.

CVE-2013-1901

    An unprivileged user could run commands that could interfere with
    in-progress backups

For the stable distribution (squeeze), postgresql-9.1 is not available.
DSA-2657-1 has been released for CVE-2013-1900 affecting posgresql-8.4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1.9-0wheezy1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.1 packages.

# E.16. Release 9.1.9

> **Release Date:** 2013-04-04

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.1.8. For
information about new features in the 9.1 major release, see
[Section E.25](release-9-1.html).

## E.16.1. Migration to Version 9.1.9

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.1.X.

However, this release corrects several errors in management
of GiST indexes. After installing this update, it is advisable
to REINDEX any GiST indexes that meet
one or more of the conditions described below.

Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than
9.1.6, see [Section E.19](release-9-1-6.html).

## E.16.2. Changes

* Fix insecure parsing of server command-line switches
  (Mitsumasa Kondo, Kyotaro Horiguchi)

  A connection request containing a database name that
  begins with "-" could be crafted to damage or
  destroy files within the server's data directory, even if
  the request is eventually rejected. (CVE-2013-1899)
* Reset OpenSSL randomness state in each postmaster child
  process (Marko Kreen)

  This avoids a scenario wherein random numbers generated
  by contrib/pgcrypto functions
  might be relatively easy for another database user to
  guess. The risk is only significant when the postmaster is
  configured with ssl = on but most connections don't use SSL
  encryption. (CVE-2013-1900)
* Make REPLICATION privilege checks test current user not
  authenticated user (Noah Misch)

  An unprivileged database user could exploit this mistake
  to call `pg_start_backup()` or
  `pg_stop_backup()`, thus
  possibly interfering with creation of routine backups.
  (CVE-2013-1901)
* Fix GiST indexes to not use "fuzzy" geometric comparisons when it's not
  appropriate to do so (Alexander Korotkov)

  The core geometric types perform comparisons using
  "fuzzy" equality, but
  `gist_box_same` must do exact
  comparisons, else GiST indexes using it might become
  inconsistent. After installing this update, users should
  REINDEX any GiST indexes on
  box, polygon,
  circle, or point columns, since all of these use
  `gist_box_same`.
* Fix erroneous range-union and penalty logic in GiST
  indexes that use contrib/btree\_gist for variable-width data
  types, that is text, bytea, bit, and
  numeric columns (Tom Lane)

  These errors could result in inconsistent indexes in
  which some keys that are present would not be found by
  searches, and also in useless index bloat. Users are
  advised to REINDEX such indexes
  after installing this update.
* Fix bugs in GiST page splitting code for multi-column
  indexes (Tom Lane)

  These errors could result in inconsistent indexes in
  which some keys that are present would not be found by
  searches, and also in indexes that are unnecessarily
  inefficient to search. Users are advised to REINDEX multi-column GiST indexes after
  installing this update.
* Fix `gist_point_consistent`
  to handle fuzziness consistently (Alexander Korotkov)

  Index scans on GiST indexes on point columns would sometimes yield results
  different from a sequential scan, because `gist_point_consistent` disagreed with the
  underlying operator code about whether to do comparisons
  exactly or fuzzily.
* Fix buffer leak in WAL replay (Heikki Linnakangas)

  This bug could result in "incorrect
  local pin count" errors during replay, making
  recovery impossible.
* Fix race condition in DELETE
  RETURNING (Tom Lane)

  Under the right circumstances, DELETE RETURNING could attempt to fetch data
  from a shared buffer that the current process no longer has
  any pin on. If some other process changed the buffer
  meanwhile, this would lead to garbage RETURNING output, or even a crash.
* Fix infinite-loop risk in regular expression compilation
  (Tom Lane, Don Porter)
* Fix potential null-pointer dereference in regular
  expression compilation (Tom Lane)
* Fix `to_char()` to use
  ASCII-only case-folding rules where appropriate (Tom
  Lane)

  This fixes misbehavior of some template patterns that
  should be locale-independent, but mishandled "I" and
  "i" in
  Turkish locales.
* Fix unwanted rejection of timestamp 1999-12-31 24:00:00 (Tom Lane)
* Fix logic error when a single transaction does
  UNLISTEN then LISTEN (Tom Lane)

  The session wound up not listening for notify events at
  all, though it surely should listen in this case.
* Fix possible planner crash after columns have been added
  to a view that's depended on by another view (Tom Lane)
* Remove useless "picksplit doesn't
  support secondary split" log messages (Josh Hansen,
  Tom Lane)

  This message seems to have been added in expectation of
  code that was never written, and probably never will be,
  since GiST's default handling of secondary splits is
  actually pretty good. So stop nagging end users about
  it.
* Fix possible failure to send a session's last few
  transaction commit/abort counts to the statistics collector
  (Tom Lane)
* Eliminate memory leaks in PL/Perl's `spi_prepare()` function (Alex Hunsaker,
  Tom Lane)
* Fix pg\_dumpall to
  handle database names containing "=" correctly
  (Heikki Linnakangas)
* Avoid crash in pg\_dump
  when an incorrect connection string is given (Heikki
  Linnakangas)
* Ignore invalid indexes in pg\_dump and pg\_upgrade (Michael Paquier, Bruce
  Momjian)

  Dumping invalid indexes can cause problems at restore
  time, for example if the reason the index creation failed
  was because it tried to enforce a uniqueness condition not
  satisfied by the table's data. Also, if the index creation
  is in fact still in progress, it seems reasonable to
  consider it to be an uncommitted DDL change, which
  pg\_dump wouldn't be
  expected to dump anyway. pg\_upgrade now also skips invalid
  indexes rather than failing.
* In pg\_basebackup,
  include only the current server version's subdirectory when
  backing up a tablespace (Heikki Linnakangas)
* Add a server version check in pg\_basebackup and pg\_receivexlog, so they fail cleanly
  with version combinations that won't work (Heikki
  Linnakangas)
* Fix contrib/pg\_trgm's
  `similarity()` function to
  return zero for trigram-less strings (Tom Lane)

  Previously it returned NaN due
  to internal division by zero.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2013b for DST law
  changes in Chile, Haiti, Morocco, Paraguay, and some
  Russian areas. Also, historical zone data corrections for
  numerous places.

  Also, update the time zone abbreviation files for recent
  changes in Russia and elsewhere: CHOT, GET,
  IRKT, KGT, KRAT,
  MAGT, MAWT, MSK,
  NOVT, OMST, TKT,
  VLAT, WST, YAKT,
  YEKT now follow their current
  meanings, and VOLT
  (Europe/Volgograd) and MIST
  (Antarctica/Macquarie) are added to the default
  abbreviations list.

# E.11. Release 9.0.13

> **Release Date:** 2013-04-04

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.0.12. For
information about new features in the 9.0 major release, see
[Section E.24](release-9-0.html).

## E.11.1. Migration to Version 9.0.13

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.0.X.

However, this release corrects several errors in management
of GiST indexes. After installing this update, it is advisable
to REINDEX any GiST indexes that meet
one or more of the conditions described below.

Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than
9.0.6, see [Section E.18](release-9-0-6.html).

## E.11.2. Changes

* Fix insecure parsing of server command-line switches
  (Mitsumasa Kondo, Kyotaro Horiguchi)

  A connection request containing a database name that
  begins with "-" could be crafted to damage or
  destroy files within the server's data directory, even if
  the request is eventually rejected. (CVE-2013-1899)
* Reset OpenSSL randomness state in each postmaster child
  process (Marko Kreen)

  This avoids a scenario wherein random numbers generated
  by contrib/pgcrypto functions
  might be relatively easy for another database user to
  guess. The risk is only significant when the postmaster is
  configured with ssl = on but most connections don't use SSL
  encryption. (CVE-2013-1900)
* Fix GiST indexes to not use "fuzzy" geometric comparisons when it's not
  appropriate to do so (Alexander Korotkov)

  The core geometric types perform comparisons using
  "fuzzy" equality, but
  `gist_box_same` must do exact
  comparisons, else GiST indexes using it might become
  inconsistent. After installing this update, users should
  REINDEX any GiST indexes on
  box, polygon,
  circle, or point columns, since all of these use
  `gist_box_same`.
* Fix erroneous range-union and penalty logic in GiST
  indexes that use contrib/btree\_gist for variable-width data
  types, that is text, bytea, bit, and
  numeric columns (Tom Lane)

  These errors could result in inconsistent indexes in
  which some keys that are present would not be found by
  searches, and also in useless index bloat. Users are
  advised to REINDEX such indexes
  after installing this update.
* Fix bugs in GiST page splitting code for multi-column
  indexes (Tom Lane)

  These errors could result in inconsistent indexes in
  which some keys that are present would not be found by
  searches, and also in indexes that are unnecessarily
  inefficient to search. Users are advised to REINDEX multi-column GiST indexes after
  installing this update.
* Fix `gist_point_consistent`
  to handle fuzziness consistently (Alexander Korotkov)

  Index scans on GiST indexes on point columns would sometimes yield results
  different from a sequential scan, because `gist_point_consistent` disagreed with the
  underlying operator code about whether to do comparisons
  exactly or fuzzily.
* Fix buffer leak in WAL replay (Heikki Linnakangas)

  This bug could result in "incorrect
  local pin count" errors during replay, making
  recovery impossible.
* Fix race condition in DELETE
  RETURNING (Tom Lane)

  Under the right circumstances, DELETE RETURNING could attempt to fetch data
  from a shared buffer that the current process no longer has
  any pin on. If some other process changed the buffer
  meanwhile, this would lead to garbage RETURNING output, or even a crash.
* Fix infinite-loop risk in regular expression compilation
  (Tom Lane, Don Porter)
* Fix potential null-pointer dereference in regular
  expression compilation (Tom Lane)
* Fix `to_char()` to use
  ASCII-only case-folding rules where appropriate (Tom
  Lane)

  This fixes misbehavior of some template patterns that
  should be locale-independent, but mishandled "I" and
  "i" in
  Turkish locales.
* Fix unwanted rejection of timestamp 1999-12-31 24:00:00 (Tom Lane)
* Fix logic error when a single transaction does
  UNLISTEN then LISTEN (Tom Lane)

  The session wound up not listening for notify events at
  all, though it surely should listen in this case.
* Remove useless "picksplit doesn't
  support secondary split" log messages (Josh Hansen,
  Tom Lane)

  This message seems to have been added in expectation of
  code that was never written, and probably never will be,
  since GiST's default handling of secondary splits is
  actually pretty good. So stop nagging end users about
  it.
* Fix possible failure to send a session's last few
  transaction commit/abort counts to the statistics collector
  (Tom Lane)
* Eliminate memory leaks in PL/Perl's `spi_prepare()` function (Alex Hunsaker,
  Tom Lane)
* Fix pg\_dumpall to
  handle database names containing "=" correctly
  (Heikki Linnakangas)
* Avoid crash in pg\_dump
  when an incorrect connection string is given (Heikki
  Linnakangas)
* Ignore invalid indexes in pg\_dump and pg\_upgrade (Michael Paquier, Bruce
  Momjian)

  Dumping invalid indexes can cause problems at restore
  time, for example if the reason the index creation failed
  was because it tried to enforce a uniqueness condition not
  satisfied by the table's data. Also, if the index creation
  is in fact still in progress, it seems reasonable to
  consider it to be an uncommitted DDL change, which
  pg\_dump wouldn't be
  expected to dump anyway. pg\_upgrade now also skips invalid
  indexes rather than failing.
* Fix contrib/pg\_trgm's
  `similarity()` function to
  return zero for trigram-less strings (Tom Lane)

  Previously it returned NaN due
  to internal division by zero.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2013b for DST law
  changes in Chile, Haiti, Morocco, Paraguay, and some
  Russian areas. Also, historical zone data corrections for
  numerous places.

  Also, update the time zone abbreviation files for recent
  changes in Russia and elsewhere: CHOT, GET,
  IRKT, KGT, KRAT,
  MAGT, MAWT, MSK,
  NOVT, OMST, TKT,
  VLAT, WST, YAKT,
  YEKT now follow their current
  meanings, and VOLT
  (Europe/Volgograd) and MIST
  (Antarctica/Macquarie) are added to the default
  abbreviations list.

# 2013-04-04 Security Release FAQ

The following versions make up this release:

* v9.2.4
* v9.1.9
* v9.0.13
* v8.4.17

While this FAQ covers the 2013-04-04 PostgreSQL Security Update in general,
most of its contents focus on the primary security vulnerability patched in the
release, [CVE-2013-1899](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1899).

## Are there any known exploits "in the wild" for this vulnerability?

There were no known exploits at the time of release.

## Who is particularly vulnerable because of this issue?

Any system that allows unrestricted access to the PostgreSQL network port,
such as users running PostgreSQL on a public cloud, is especially vulnerable.
Users whose servers are only accessible on protected internal networks, or who
have effective firewalling or other network access restrictions, are less
vulnerable.

This is a good general rule for database security: do not allow port access
to the database server from untrusted networks unless it is absolutely
necessary. This is as true, or more true, of other database systems as it is of
PostgreSQL.

## What is the nature of the vulnerability?

The vulnerability allows users to use a command-line switch for a PostgreSQL
connection intended for single-user recovery mode while PostgreSQL is running in
normal, multiuser mode. This can be used to harm the server.

## What potential exploits are enabled by this vulnerability?

1. Persistent Denial of Service: an unauthenticated attacker may use this
   vulnerability to cause PostgreSQL error messages to be appended to targeted
   files in the PostgreSQL data directory on the server. Files corrupted in
   this way may cause the database server to crash, and to refuse to restart.
   The database server can be fixed either by editing the files and removing
   the garbage text, or restoring from backup.
2. Configuration Setting Privilege Escalation: in the event that an attacker
   has a legitimate login on the database server, and the server is configured
   such that this user name and the database name are identical (e.g. user
   *web*, database *web*), then this vulnerability may be used to
   temporarily set one configuration variable with the privileges of the
   superuser.
3. Arbitrary Code Execution: if the attacker meets all of the qualifications
   under 2 above, and has the ability to save files to the filesystem as well
   (even to the *tmp* directory), then they can use the vulnerability to
   load and execute arbitrary C code. SELinux will prevent this specific
   type of exploit.

## Which major versions of PostgreSQL are affected?

Versions 9.0, 9.1 and 9.2.

Users of version 8.4 are not affected. Users of version 8.3 and earlier are
not affected by this issue, but are vulnerable to other unpatched security
vulnerabilities, since those versions are EOL.

## How can users protect themselves?

* Download the update release and update all of your servers as soon as
  possible.
* Ensure that PostgreSQL is not open to connections from untrusted networks.
* Audit your database users to be certain that all logins require proper
  credentials, and that the only logins which exist are legitimate and in
  current use.

Use of advanced security frameworks, such as SELinux with PostgreSQL's
SEPostgres extension, also lessen or eliminate the exposure and potential damage
from PostgreSQL security vulnerabilities.

## Who was given access to the information about the vulnerability?

Specifics about the vulnerability were first disclosed to our security team.

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) has had, for several years, a
policy granting engineers who build PostgreSQL binary packages to be distributed
to the public (such as RPMs and Windows installers) early access to be able to
release information and code so that packages can be ready on the official
release date. This applied to both minor and major releases. Given the
increasing prevalence of PostgreSQL-as-a-Service (PGaaS) as a distribution
mechanism, we are revising this policy to accommodate the case of the cloud
providers. The new policy is still being edited and should be available soon.

## When was the vulnerability discovered?

This vulnerability was first reported to the PostgreSQL Global Development
Group (PGDG) security team on March 12, 2013.

We filed for the CVE, with the assistance of the Red Hat security team, on
March 27.

## Who discovered the vulnerability?

Mitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi of NTT Open Source Software Center
while conducting a security audit. NTT is a longtime contributor to PostgreSQL.

## How was the vulnerability reported?

Kondo-san and Horiguchi-san sent email to security@postgresql.org.

## As reported by TechCrunch and Hacker News, some entities including cloud platform provider Heroku were given early access. Why did this occur?

Heroku was given access to updated source code which patched the
vulnerability at the same time as other packagers. Because Heroku was especially
vulnerable, the PostgreSQL Core Team worked with them -- to secure their
infrastructure and to use their deployment as a test-bed for the security
patches. This helped to verify that the security update did not break any
application functionality. Heroku has a history both of working closely with
community developers, and of testing experimental features in their PostgreSQL
service.

## Who was given access to the code before the official release?

We have two teams that communicate on private lists hosted on the PGDG
infrastructure. Both teams had access to the source code prior to the release of
any packages for analyzing the security patch and then creating packages for
distributing PostgreSQL binaries. These are our Security Team and our Packagers
List. In both cases, these groups had early access in order to participate in
patching the security hole.

## How can end-users with large deployments or security-sensitive applications obtain early access security information?

At this time, the PostgreSQL project does not provide users who are not
directly involved in patching security vulnerabilities or packaging PostgreSQL
for other users early access to security information, patches, or code. It is
possible that at some time in the future we may be in a position to offer such
access, but we are not able to now.

## Was taking the repository private while this security discussion was ongoing the proper thing to do?

Given the severity of the vulnerability, the PostgreSQL Core team deliberated
and determined the security risk posed by having the source code for the fix
available before the packages were made available outweighed the publicâs
interest in having immediate access.

Normal procedure for sharing information about security releases is to send
an announcement our developer mailing list, pgsql-hackers@lists.postgresql.org, a week
before a new release. Tom Lane did this. Then, due to the severity of the
security vulnerability, we also sent an announcement to
pgsql-announce@postgresql.org and to our RSS News feed on our website homepage.
We did this because we wanted to give DBAs sufficient time to plan for a
maintenance window to upgrade.

The timing of the announcements and the release was based on the availability
of volunteer packagers and release managers to conduct the release.

## How is the PostgreSQL project organized?

PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) is a volunteer-run, global
organisation. We have a six-person core team, a number of Major Contributors and
several mailing lists that make up the centralized portion of our community.
[See here for details
about contributors](/community/contributors/).

## How are new members added to the Security Team or Packagers?

Membership in both groups is maintained by the Core Team.

## How often does PostgreSQL find new security vulnerabilities?

We find zero to seven minor security issues a year. This is the first
security issue of this magnitude since 2006: the "backslash escape encoding
issue", which affected MySQL and a few other database systems as well.

## How was the vulnerability introduced?

It was created as a side effect of a refactoring effort to make establishing
new connections to a PostgreSQL server faster, and the associated code more
maintainable.

## Who discovers vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL?

We are fortunate to have a large pool of security engineers who test
PostgreSQL regularly and responsibly report security issues so that they can be
fixed. This includes:
