```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The mod_dav_svn module in Subversion uses excessive amounts of memory when a large number of properties are set or deleted on a node (file or directory). This is due to how Apache httpd and Subversion handle memory pooling, where memory isn't immediately released after a request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory management",
       "DoS vulnerability in mod_dav_svn."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, authenticated attacker could cause a denial of service by exhausting available memory on the server, making the Subversion service unavailable.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker with write access to the Subversion repository can trigger this vulnerability by repeatedly setting or deleting a large number of properties on a node.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires write access to the Subversion repository, which typically means they need to be authenticated."
  }
