{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the way GIMP performed loading of certain XWD image dumps.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow when allocating memory for the color map using `g_new` in GIMP's XWD plugin.",
     "Lack of validation for `l_colormap_entries` value from the image header."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XWD image file that, when processed, could lead to gimp XWD plug-in crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the gimp executable.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "A remote attacker can provide a specially crafted XWD format image file.",
    "The user must open the malicious XWD file with GIMP."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to get the user to open a specially crafted XWD image file."
