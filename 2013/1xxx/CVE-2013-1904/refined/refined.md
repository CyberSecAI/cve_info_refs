Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1904:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `save-pref` command within Roundcube Webmail. The `save_pref.inc` script allows modification of session variables via user-supplied input, specifically the `_name` and `_value` parameters. The script then saves these values to the user's session and configuration. By manipulating the `_name` and `_value` parameters, an attacker could inject arbitrary values, including file paths, which are then used in subsequent includes/processing, allowing local file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The core vulnerability is LFI. Attackers can include local files through the `save-pref` action.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The `save_pref.inc` script does not properly validate user input for the `_name` and `_value` parameters, allowing arbitrary strings to be processed.
*   **Session Variable Manipulation:** The ability to manipulate session variables directly from user input allows attackers to alter application behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server accessible by the user running Roundcube Webmail, which could include sensitive configuration files, database credentials, and potentially other sensitive information.
*   **Full Mail Access:** By gaining access to the Roundcube configuration file (db.inc.php) which contains database credentials, an attacker can extract session data to then obtain passwords for user's email accounts.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Access to sensitive files and credentials could enable more advanced attacks, including privilege escalation if applicable or gaining access to other applications/services.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the Roundcube web interface. The request must target the `save-pref` action.
*   **Manipulation of Parameters:** The attacker must manipulate the `_name` and `_value` parameters within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Roundcube web interface.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, as the vulnerable code is part of the `save-pref` action, which processes the `_name` and `_value` parameters without proper validation.
*  **Knowledge of Target Server:** The attacker needs to know the path of the files on the target server, at minimum the path to the `db.inc.php` file for extracting database credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Roundcube versions 0.8.5 and 0.9-RC, and fixed in version 0.8.6.
*   The provided patch involves disabling the `save-pref` action, and a proper fix was later released by developers.
