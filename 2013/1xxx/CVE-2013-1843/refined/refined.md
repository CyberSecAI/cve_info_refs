Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1843:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper user input validation in the "access tracking mechanism" of Typo3 CMS. Specifically, the `jumpurl` parameter used for redirection is not validated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Open Redirection:**  The primary weakness is an open redirection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL containing a `jumpurl` parameter that redirects a user to an arbitrary website.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker can leverage this to conduct phishing attacks by redirecting users to a fake login page or a page that hosts malware.
*   **Malware distribution:** Users can be redirected to websites containing malware, leading to infections.
*   **Social engineering:** The vulnerability can be used in social engineering attacks where users are tricked into visiting malicious sites disguised as legitimate pages.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **URL manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URL, particularly the `jumpurl` parameter to point to a malicious destination.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft and distribute URLs containing the malicious `jumpurl` parameter. This could be done through emails, social media posts, or other methods. They do not require prior access to the system.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability might break existing published links that relied on the old behavior of the `jumpurl` parameter.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Typo3 CMS, specifically: 4.5.x, 4.6.x and 4.7.x
*   The fix requires updating Typo3 to the following versions: 4.5.24, 4.6.17, 4.7.9, or later versions.

In summary, CVE-2013-1843 is an open redirection vulnerability in Typo3 CMS that arises from a lack of validation of user input in the access tracking mechanism, allowing attackers to redirect users to arbitrary websites via a crafted URL.
