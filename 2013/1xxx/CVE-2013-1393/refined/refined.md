The CurvyCorners module does not sufficiently filter user-entered text when displaying it, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious code.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient filtering of user-provided input.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to the impersonation of logged-in Drupal users, bypassing access controls, crafting phishing attacks, or browser exploits.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is triggered when displaying user-entered text without proper sanitization.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs a role with the "administer curvycorners" permission to exploit this vulnerability.
