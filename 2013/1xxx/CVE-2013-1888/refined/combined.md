## Description

[![@guettli](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414336?u=74d41e48c03a7a3dd1b9fdac4d6d96c65e5e5275&v=4&size=48)](/guettli)[guettli](https://github.com/guettli)opened [on Nov 15, 2012](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/725#issue-8381771)

Well known temporary file names like /tmp/pip-build are insecure.

eviluser@host:~$ ln -s /home/otheruser/some-directory /tmp/pip-build

otheruser@host:~$ pip install ....

--> pip writes in /home/otheruser/some-directory. The user "otheruser" does not know it.

I tried it with pip 1.2.1 and content was written to /home/otheruser/some-directory.
