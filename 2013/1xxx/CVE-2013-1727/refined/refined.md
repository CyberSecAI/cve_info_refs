**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-1727

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Firefox for Android's handling of file:// URIs and symbolic links. Specifically, when a webpage loaded from the local filesystem using a `file://` URI contains a symbolic link, Firefox incorrectly resolves the link's target when performing same-origin checks. This occurs because the browser was normalizing the path, which dereferenced the symlink, before performing the same-origin check. This allowed a malicious app, that had created a symlink pointing from within Firefox's directory to a location outside the allowed access boundary, to bypass the browser's same-origin policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The core issue is the circumvention of the same-origin policy for local files. Normally, web pages loaded from the `file://` scheme should only be able to access resources within the same directory or its subdirectories. The symbolic link allowed access to files outside this boundary.
- **Incorrect Symbolic Link Handling:** Firefox was not correctly handling symbolic links when determining the origin of a local file. Instead of comparing the original file against the resolved symlink target, it was normalizing the path, thus dereferencing the symlink and effectively comparing the same file against itself, which bypassed the check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By bypassing the same-origin policy, an attacker can potentially inject malicious scripts into a locally loaded webpage.
- **Access to Sensitive Data:** The primary impact is the potential access to locally stored Firefox files, including those containing passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious App Installation:** The attacker must first convince the user to install a malicious Android app.
- **Symbolic Link Creation:** The malicious app creates a symbolic link within Firefox's data directory pointing to sensitive files outside of the allowed boundary, such as profile files.
- **Local File Access:** The malicious app uses intents or other methods to load a specially crafted local HTML file in Firefox that includes the symbolic link.
- **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker, having bypassed the same-origin policy, can then access and exfiltrate the targeted sensitive data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Android App Development/Deployment:** The attacker needs to be able to develop and distribute an Android application.
- **Rooted Device:** While the initial report indicates testing on a rooted device, the core of the vulnerability was in Firefox. It is not explicitly stated that the exploit REQUIRES a rooted device, just that it was tested on one.
- **Ability to write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem**: In order to create the symlink the malicious app has to be able to write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to Firefox for Android, not the desktop version.
- The fix involved modifying the path normalization process to avoid dereferencing the symbolic link during origin checks.
- The security rating was initially `sec-high` but was later lowered to `sec-moderate` because it required prior installation of a malicious application. It was also noted, however, that Firefox was actively helping to bypass the Android security model.
