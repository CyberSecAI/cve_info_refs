The provided content is related to CVE-2013-1711.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass XrayWrappers by using XBL scopes. Specifically, XBL functions could be invoked with non-native JavaScript arguments, allowing content to circumvent the security advantages of XBL scopes. This occurs because privileged code can obtain content JS objects without the expected Xray waivers. When an XBL scope accesses a field off of a bound node with Xray vision, it grabs the underlying JS object without waiving Xray. This behavior is normally not an issue, but the wrapped XBL functions are placed on the content-accessible prototype, and thus can be invoked by content using arbitrary JS objects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Bypass of XrayWrappers: XBL scopes can be manipulated to bypass XrayWrappers from within the Chrome.
-  Exposure of privileged code: Web content can potentially confuse privileged code and weaken invariants.
- Incomplete Xray layer: The Xray layer between chrome and content is incomplete modulo instances of waiving.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
-  Potential for arbitrary code execution due to circumvention of security measures.
-  Weakening of security invariants within the browser.
-  The ability of web content to manipulate privileged code execution in an unintended manner.

**Attack vectors:**
- Invoking XBL functions with non-native JS objects as `this` and arguments.
- Manipulating the prototype chain of content objects.
- Exploiting the lack of consistent Xray waiving when XBL scopes are used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the context of a web page.
- No other special capabilities are explicitly mentioned in the provided content, indicating a standard web-based attack.
