Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Zabbix API's `user.login` method which allows overriding LDAP configuration parameters through the 'cnf' parameter. This bypasses the configured LDAP settings stored in the database, potentially allowing authentication using a different LDAP server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The `user.login` method should not allow arbitrary modification of LDAP configuration parameters.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting custom LDAP configuration parameters, an attacker can bypass the intended authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Zabbix system by manipulating the LDAP authentication parameters.
*   **Data Breach:** Once inside the system, the attacker could potentially access sensitive monitoring data, configuration information, or other resources.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The attacker could potentially move laterally within the network based on the access gained.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious API request to the `user.login` method, including a 'cnf' parameter with custom LDAP server details.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Zabbix API endpoint.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the API endpoint and the parameters to exploit the issue.
*   **LDAP Server Access (optional but recommended):** To successfully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker ideally needs a malicious or controlled LDAP server.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects all Zabbix versions starting from 1.8.1.
*   The issue was reported by Pavels Jelisejevs.
*   Patches have been developed and are available in the provided diff files (`ldap_1-8-2.diff`, `ldap_2-0-1.diff`, and `ldap_2-1-0.diff`).
*   The issue was classified as "Blocker" priority due to the severity.

**Summary**

The content clearly demonstrates that CVE-2013-1364 relates to an LDAP authentication bypass in the Zabbix API via a configurable 'cnf' parameter within user login functionality allowing for arbitrary LDAP configuration injection. This allows for unauthorized access to the system.

**Note:** The CVE description is still a placeholder, but the provided content gives sufficient detail about the vulnerability.
