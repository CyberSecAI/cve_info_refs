Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-1179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the SNMP subsystem of Cisco NX-OS software. This vulnerability specifically affects the SNMP and License Manager components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow, triggered when processing a malicious SNMP query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This means they can potentially gain full control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious SNMP query via UDP port 161 to the affected device.
- **SNMP Protocol:**  The attack uses the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device (i.e., possess valid SNMP credentials). For SNMP v1 and v2, the attacker needs the community strings. For SNMP v3, a valid username and password are required.
- **Knowledge of Network Configuration:** The attacker must be able to reach the affected device over the network and target the SNMP service (UDP port 161).
- **SNMP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious SNMP query to trigger the overflow.

**Additional Notes:**

- SNMP is disabled by default on Cisco NX-OS devices.
- The malicious SNMP request could contain a spoofed origin address, as SNMP is primarily UDP-based.
- The vulnerability can be triggered via SNMP over IPv4 and SNMP over IPv6.
- The vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID CSCtx54830.

**Affected Products (from the advisory):**
- Cisco Nexus 7000 Series devices
- Cisco MDS 9000 Multilayer Switch/Director Family devices

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to the recommended software versions as provided in the advisory.
- The advisory also mentions an Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) with instructions to detect and mitigate potential exploitation.
