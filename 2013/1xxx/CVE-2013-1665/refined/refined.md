Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in the XML parser used by several OpenStack components (Cinder, Nova, and Horizon/Django) and Python XML libraries. The vulnerability arises from the parser's improper handling of external entities within XML documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **External Entity Expansion:** The XML parser is vulnerable to external entity expansion attacks. By including external entities in specially crafted XML requests, an attacker can force the parser to connect to external URLs.
-   **Local File Disclosure:** The vulnerability can also allow an attacker to read local files from the server by referencing them as external entities in the crafted XML document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information on the server by reading files accessible to the user running the service.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could lead to a DoS condition, as the parser connecting to external URLs or trying to process large files, could consume excessive CPU, memory, or network bandwidth resources.
-   **System Load:** The connection to external entities can cause a large amount of system load.
-   **Rebound Attacks:** An attacker may utilize the server as a proxy to perform attacks on other systems by abusing the vulnerable XML parsing functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a malicious XML request to the Cinder, Nova or Horizon APIs that are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable service.
-   **Ability to craft XML:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious XML payloads that include external entities.
-   **No authentication is required for DoS:** To cause a denial-of-service using excessive resource consumption, no authentication is required.
-   **Authentication required for local file access:** To access local files, the attacker may need to be authenticated with the service.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is present in the Python XML libraries themselves, not just OpenStack.
-   Patches provided by OpenStack are workarounds.
-   The severity is rated as "moderate" for OpenStack.
-   The fix involves disabling DTD parsing and external entity expansion.
-   Some of the provided data includes links to patches that disable external entities in SAX parser.
-   The vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1665.
