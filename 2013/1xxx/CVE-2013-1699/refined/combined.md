# USN-1890-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

26 June 2013

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

# IDN Display Algorithm

From MozillaWiki

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

This page explains how Firefox decides whether to display a given IDN label (a domain name is made up of one or more labels, separated by dots) in its Unicode (i.e. normal) or Punycode (i.e. gobbledigook) form.

Implementing this plan was covered by [bug 722299](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722299).

## Background

### The Problem

If we just display any possible IDN label, we open ourselves up to [IDN homograph attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack), where one identical-looking domain can spoof another. So we have to have some mechanism to decide which ones to display and which ones to not display, which does not involve comparing the domain in question against every other single domain which exists (which is impossible).

### Previous Algorithm

We updated how Firefox dealt with this in 2012. Our previous algorithm was to display as Unicode all IDN labels within TLDs on our [whitelist](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/tld-idn-policy-list.html), and display as Punycode otherwise. We checked the anti-spoofing policies of a registry before adding their TLD to the whitelist. The TLD operator had to apply directly (they cannot be nominated by another person), and on several occasions we required policy updates or implementation as a condition of getting in.

We also had a character blacklist - characters we will never display under any circumstances. This includes those which could be used to spoof the separators "/" and ".", and invisible characters. This still exists.

### Why We Changed

The old strategy provided pretty good user protection, and it provided consistency -
every Firefox everywhere works the same. However, it meant
that IDNs did not work at all in many TLDs, because the registry (for whatever reason)
had not applied for inclusion, or because we didn't think they had sufficiently
strong protections in place. In addition, ICANN was about to open
a [large number of new TLDs](http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/application-results/strings-1200utc-13jun12-en). So either maintaining a whitelist was going to become
burdensome, or the list was going to become wildly out of date and we would not
be serving our users.

## The New Idea

Instead, we now augment our whitelist with something based on ascertaining whether all the characters in a label
all come from the same script, or are from one of a limited and defined number of allowable combinations. The
hope is that any intra-script near-homographs will be recognisable to people who understand that script.

We retain the whitelist as well, because a) removing it might break
some domains which worked previously, and b) if a registry submits a
good policy, we have the ability to give them more freedom than the default restrictions do.
So an IDN is shown as Unicode if the TLD was on the whitelist or, if not, if it
met the criteria above.

## Algorithm

If a TLD is in the whitelist, we unconditionally display Unicode. If it is not, the following
algorithm applies.

[Unicode Technical Report 39](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Restriction_Level_Detection)
defines a "Moderately Restrictive" profile. It says the following (with edits for clarity, after discussion with the author):

> No characters in the label can be outside of the [Identifier Profile](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Identifier_Characters)
> (defined for us by the IDNA2008 standard,
> [RFC 5892](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5892)).
>
> All characters in each label must be from Common + Inherited + a single script, or from one of the following combinations:
>
> * Common + Inherited + Latin + Han + Hiragana + Katakana; or
> * Common + Inherited + Latin + Han + Bopomofo; or
> * Common + Inherited + Latin + Han + Hangul; or
> * Common + Inherited + Latin + any single other "Recommended" or "Aspirational" script except Cyrillic or Greek

[Unicode Technical Report 39](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Mixed_Script_Detection) gives
a definition for how we detect whether a string is "single script".

Some Common or Inherited characters
are only used in a small number (but more than one) script. Mark Davis writes:
"The Unicode Consortium in U6.1 (due out soon) is adding the property [Script\_Extensions](http://unicode.org/Public/6.1.0/ucd/ScriptExtensions.txt),
to provide data about characters which are only used in a few (but more than one) script.
The sample code in #39 should be updated to include that, so handling such cases."
This data is now available, but not yet in the Firefox platform ([bug 844106](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=844106)). In the mean time, Common and Inherited
characters are permitted without restriction.

We also implement additional checks, as suggested by TR #39 sections 5.3 and 5.4:

* Display as Punycode labels which use more than one numbering system
* Display as Punycode labels which contain both simplified-only and traditional-only Chinese characters -- [bug 857481](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=857481)
* Display as Punycode labels which have sequences of the same nonspacing mark

### Possible Issues and Open Questions

The following issues are still open, but were not considered important enough to block initial implementation.

Further suggestions from TR #39:

* Check to see that all the characters are in the sets of exemplar characters for at least one language in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository. [XXX What does this mean? -- Gerv]

Also:

* Should we document our character hard-blacklist as part of this exercise? It's already visible in the prefs. Are any characters in it legal in IDNA2008 anyway? We should review it to make sure we aren't disallowing characters now allowed by IDNA 2008.
* Do we want to allow the user to choose between multiple "restriction levels", or have a hidden pref? There are significant downsides to allowing this...
* Do we ever want to display errors other than just by using Punycode? I suggest not...
* Should we add Armenian to the list of scripts which cannot mix with Latin?

### Downsides

This system permits whole-script confusables
(All-Latin "scope.tld" vs all-Cyrillic "ѕсоре.tld"). However, so do the
solutions of the other browsers, and it has not proved to be a
significant problem so far. If there is a problem, every browser is equally affected.

Our response to this issue is that in the end, it is up to registries
to make sure that their customers
cannot rip each other off. Browsers can put some technical restrictions in place,
but we are not in a position to do this job for them while still maintaining
a level playing field for non-Latin scripts on the web. The registries are the
only people in a position to implement the proper checking here. For our part,
we want to make sure we don't treat non-Latin scripts as second-class citizens.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-61

## Homograph domain spoofing in .com, .net and .name

Announced
June 25, 2013
Reporter
3ric Johanson
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 22
* SeaMonkey 2.19

### Description

Security researcher **3ric Johanson** reported in discussions
with **Richard Newman** and **Holt Sorenson** that
Verisign's prevention measures for homograph attacks using Internationalized
Domain Names (IDN) were insufficiently rigorous, and this led to a limited
possibility for domain spoofing in Firefox.

IDN allows non-English speakers to use domains in their local language. Many
supported characters are similar or identical to others in English, allowing for
the potential spoofing of domain names and for phishing attacks when not
blocked. In consultation with Verisign, Mozilla had added .com, .net, and .name
top-level domains to its IDN whitelist, allowing for IDN use in those top-level
domains without restrictions. However, it became clear that a number of
historical dangerous registrations continued to be valid.

This issue has been fixed by removing the .com, .net, and .name top-level
domains from the IDN whitelist, and supplementing the whitelist implementation
with technical restrictions against script-mixing in domain labels. These
restrictions apply to all non-whitelisted top-level domains. More information on
the exact algorithm used can be found [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IDN_Display_Algorithm).

<http://www.shmoo.com/idn/>
Observe that our presentation of both 'evil' and 'good' URIs is identical.
Then compare to Safari (which shows "www.xn--theshmogroup-bgk.com" instead of "www.theshmoogroup.com").
This is probably filed under the wrong component, but worth filing than not at all!

If ya'll are trying to block chars based on a blacklist, I wish you the best of luck with that \*very complex\* task. Is there a table of homograph-attack based chars in unicode somewhere?

There are some details from the original bug here: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=279099](/show_bug.cgi?id=279099 "RESOLVED FIXED - Protect against homograph attacks (spoofing using punycode IDNs)")

|  | [Gervase Markham [:gerv]](/user_profile?user_id=9911)  Assignee |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=840882#c8)• 12 years ago |
|  | |

The situation is as follows:
Since the registration of www.xn--theshmogroup-bgk.com, Verisign has adopted more strict spoofing-related registration policies. You can find them here:
<http://www.verisigninc.com/en_US/products-and-services/domain-name-services/value-added-products/idn-domain-names/idn-code-points/registration-rules/index.xhtml>
In particular, www.xn--theshmogroup-bgk.com would no longer be permitted to be registered because it contains characters from both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts, which are not both together in any of the character tables linked from that page. (And if there is no applicable table, then no script mixing is permitted at all.)
We decided that we were not going to ask Verisign to go and revoke the registrations of legacy domains which combined characters in this way.
Due to the upcoming massive expansion of the root namespace, a whitelist-based approach is no longer scalable. So, we are moving to a new mechanism for determining whether or not to display a given IDN. Details of how it works, and the rationale behind it, can be found here:
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/IDN_Display_Algorithm>
That's [bug 722299](/show_bug.cgi?id=722299 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement new IDN Unicode display algorithm"), and the next step is a security review, which will happen soon.
If that algorithm was implemented and was the only algorithm in place, the www.xn--theshmogroup-bgk.com URL would again display as Punycode. (Currently, the plan is to leave the whitelist in place for backward-compatibility reasons, so www.xn--theshmogroup-bgk.com would still display as now. However, as noted above, further registrations of this type of domain name are not possible.)
We are certainly not going to add cyrillic-o to the IDN character blacklist; that suggestion misunderstands the purpose of the blacklist. That blacklist is designed to prevent the use of characters which spoof separators and other protocol characters (".", "/" etc.) and prevents their use anywhere in the domain name, not just in labels which are registered directly with registries. (Once we start restricting permitted characters to those allowed by IDNA2008, this list will get a lot shorter. That's [bug 479520](/show_bug.cgi?id=479520 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement IDNA2008 and Unicode UTS #46").)

I am still looking into this. The fact is that all of the other browsers correctly detect something is wrong with the test URLs. It sounds like Mozilla got strong armed by verisign at the cost of customer security.

Er, what do you think Verisign "strong-armed" us with? What hold do they have over us, exactly?
If you object to our course of action, you will need to explain what you would do. Maintain the whitelist in the face of thousands of new TLDs? Require the revocation of an unknown number of domains registered (in most cases!) in good faith, and currently in use by their owners?
If there's still a security hole here, then go and pull the same trick by registering a new spoofing domain. If you can do that, then I'll agree there's a problem (but I'll blame Verisign for it, not us - as we should have done first time round).

I don't have any insight into what relationship you have with Verisign. You said "Verisign have emailed me to ask that .com, .net and .name be added to the whitelist." in [bug #770877](/show_bug.cgi?id=770877 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add .com, .net, .name to IDN TLD whitelist").
Here's my understanding of the history of IDN:

- 2005: I register a bogus paypal.com url which is silently accepted by most major browsers. RFC authors have no comment. thx, hoffman.

- 2005 to present: new standards slowly get drafted to better filter IDNs at the time of registration.
- Present: Thousands (hundreds?) of bogus registrations have been done in the past 10 years.

- Present: Verisign decides to not apply the new rules to existing registrations, and not even review them.
So at this point you have a 800 gorilla telling you to adopt something which will have a negative effect on a majority of your customers.
What would I do? I would not adopt standards like this, or adopt them with tooling in place which can help protect my customers. As 99% of mozilla customers will only encounter Cyrillic chars/domains as part of a attack, it seems shortsighted to expose them to such risk without a warning dialog box of some kind.
If my browser loads and renders a url which is in violation of the standards, (even it it shouldn't exist based on the registration rules) I would expect it to WARN ME, not just SILENTLY OWN ME.
I will do some testing of how (in)effective their registration filtering is in the next week or so. I suspect you can still register domain names via 3rd parties which don't meet their standards. But I still expect my browser to protect me, regardless of the results of those tests.
Mozilla is the only browser that fails this \*\*\*\* bogus IDN. This is a real shame, as it's my daily ride...

That's fair comment. My discussions with Verisign were mostly by email.

Do you have evidence for that assertion?

IDNA2008 doesn't in itself directly tackle the homograph problem (and is not designed to). See <http://www.unicode.org/faq/idn.html#26> It does reduce the list of acceptable characters by removing e.g. much punctuation, which helps, but is by no means sufficient.

Any suggestion that Verisign leaned on Mozilla in some way is incorrect. We applied the same criteria to them which we applied to other applicants - stricter, in fact, because in view of the historical problem (although what you did would have worked just as fine in .org or .somethingelse) we had a public discussion to see if anyone had particular concerns.

There are many reasons why that's a bad idea; if you were paying any attention to the years of discussion which followed what happened in 2005, you would know some of them. A quick run-down of ones which come immediately to mind:
- The goal here is to make all scripts and languages on the web (and thereby the people who use them) first-class citizens; having warning dialogs for some scripts does not meet that goal
- And no, you can't base it on the browser UI language to decide whether to alert; many, many people use the en-US build even if they don't speak English or don't speak it well
- Warning dialogs are terrible UI and get dismissed and ignored

Fundamentally, it's not possible for a browser to determine with certainty if a given domain name is confusable with another one. You can try certain proxies for determining if it is, but all of them are fallible in nasty ways. There needs to be human decision involved - which is why registries need to have sensible anti-spoofing homograph policies. Mozilla has been requiring this for IDN enablement since 2005, and in doing so has probably done more to prevent users seeing IDN spoofing problems than anyone else. However, the period of time for which that is feasible is coming to an end, and so the registries (all 2000+ of them, as there soon will be) need to take responsibility for not letting customer A shaft customer B.

That should not be so; if you discover that it is, then I will take it up with Verisign immediately.

Once the new script mixing code is in place, it'll fail again.

> Please supply functional instructions for now to disable idn.
1. Open about:config
2. type "idn." into the filter field
3. double-click on "network.IDN.whitelist.com" to toggle it false
To disable IDN more globally you could instead toggle the pref "network.IDN\_show\_punycode" from false to true.
There is another pref that may \_look\_ like what you want, but if you set "network.enableIDN" to false then non-ascii URLs will simply fail to load, disenfranchising many legitimate sites around the world. If you're going to suggest Americans don't need to see IDN at least tell them the show\_punycode pref rather than how to erect their own Great Firewall of Xenophobia.

We should probably remove that pref. It's confusingly named, and when you switch it, it breaks the web. [Bug 842282](/show_bug.cgi?id=842282 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove network.enableIDN pref") filed.

Not so, as you yourself pointed out above in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=840882#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - Homograph attack prevention is incomplete"). Or do we plan to revert the last few additions to the whitelist when checking in [bug 722299](/show_bug.cgi?id=722299 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement new IDN Unicode display algorithm")?

That's a course of action I'm seriously considering (or perhaps some other criteria for trimming the whitelist once the code goes in); I want to hear (shareable) answers to my questions sent to my Verisign contact first.

A couple of days ago, my contact at Verisign told me the following, by phone:
\* As of November 2012, there are approximately 2100 domain names in .com and .net which are IDNA2008-invalid. (He doesn't expect there to be many at all in .name.) This is not the same as the number which might be invalid under the current registration rules, because the current rules specify more than just IDNA2008-compatibility. In particular, there are table-based character restrictions.
\* In late September 2012, as part of the process of applying for inclusion in Mozilla, Verisign contacted all its registrars who had registered a domain name which is IDNA2008-invalid. It asked (not required) them to contact the registrant to ask (not require) them to give up the domain and replace it with a valid one. This process did not include domains which are IDNA2008-valid but which do not match a character table. One example of such a domain is the TSG test domain.
It seems to me that this procedure is insufficiently rigorous for us to be sure that any existing dangerous domains have been dealt with. Many dangerous domains will not have been caught by this process and, even if they were, the owner of one could simply refuse to give it up. Therefore, I think that we should take the following actions:
0) We should get the new script-mixing-checking code ([bug 722299](/show_bug.cgi?id=722299 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement new IDN Unicode display algorithm")) reviewed and checked in as quickly as possible. If we don't have this, removing a TLD from the whitelist will cause display breakage for a lot of valid domains.
1) We should investigate the possibility of forward-porting it to Aurora, at least. Given that it is additive to the existing whitelist, there is no possibility of breaking the display of domains, except in the case where we remove a TLD from the whitelist.
2) Once the new code is checked in, we should immediately remove from the whitelist any TLDs who have been added since the inclusion criteria changed (1 Feb 2012), and who have not been operating anti-spoofing measures for the entirety of the time they have been issuing IDNs, and who have not pursued a policy of compulsory de-registration of names which are now disallowed.
This list happens to be:
.com
.net
.name
This is [bug 843739](/show_bug.cgi?id=843739 "RESOLVED FIXED - back out bug 770877 (take .com, .net, and .name off the IDN whitelist)"). This will deal with the legacy problem, and mean that TSG's test domain and any other risky legacy domains will no longer work. We reserve the right to remove other TLDs from the whitelist where we find their procedures are insufficiently rigorous.
Dan would also like to remove the whitelist entirely. I am not opposed to that, but I think we need to do more research on the impact of doing so.

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
