Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1170:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Cisco Prime Network Control System (NCS) appliances running software versions prior to 1.1.2 contain a database user account created with default credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Default Credentials (CWE-255):** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a database user account with default, easily guessable credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Configuration Modification:** An attacker could use the default credentials to modify the application's configuration settings.
*   **Service Disruption:** Exploitation could lead to disruption of services provided by the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Low Access Complexity (AC:L):** Exploiting the vulnerability does not require special conditions, making it easily exploitable.
*   **No Authentication Required (Au:N):** An attacker does not need to authenticate prior to exploiting the vulnerability, they can connect directly to the database and use the default credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Cisco Prime NCS appliance.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to know or guess the default database user account credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco Prime NCS versions prior to 1.1.2.
*   Cisco Prime NCS provides converged access and user management across wired and wireless networks and delivers lifecycle management of Cisco wireless LAN infrastructure.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves removing the default credentials during installation in version 1.1.2 and above.
*   There are no workarounds for the vulnerability, requiring an upgrade to a fixed software version.
*   The vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCtz30468 and CSCub54624.
*   The CVSS base score is 7.5 and the temporal score is 6.2 which indicates that it is considered a high severity vulnerability.
