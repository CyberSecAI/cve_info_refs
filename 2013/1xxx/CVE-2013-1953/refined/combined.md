| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=951257#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-04-11 20:46:39 UTC  ``` A buffer overflow flaw was reported in autotrace's input_bmp_reader() function.  When autotrace is compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE, this is caught and turned into a simple denial of service.  As reported:  In input-bmp.c, the input_bmp_reader() function creates a buffer on the  stack:  91 unsigned char buffer[64];  Later on  169 else if (Bitmap_File_Head.biSize <= 64) /* Probably OS/2 2.x */ 170 { 171 if (!ReadOK (fd, buffer, Bitmap_File_Head.biSize - 4))  We control Bitmap_File_Head.biSize. A value of 0 meets the <=64  requirements, and 0 - 4 should result in almost 4294967295 bytes being  read into the buffer.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=951257#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-04-12 05:05:00 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Murray McAllister of Red Hat Security Response Team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=951257#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-04-16 12:00:52 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2013-1953](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1953) has been assigned to this issue:   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/04/16/3>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=951257#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-04-16 12:03:15 UTC  ``` Created autotrace tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 952668](show_bug.cgi?id=952668 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1953 autotrace: buffer overflow when parsing BMP files [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=951257#c5)  Jaroslav Škarvada    2013-06-28 08:26:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 766451](attachment.cgi?id=766451&action=diff "Proposed fix sent upstream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=766451&action=edit "Proposed fix sent upstream") Proposed fix sent upstream   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=951257#c6)  Fedora Update System    2013-07-09 01:40:38 UTC  ``` autotrace-0.31.1-34.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.
