Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `input_bmp_reader()` function of the `autotrace` software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `input_bmp_reader()` function allocates a fixed-size buffer of 64 bytes on the stack: `unsigned char buffer[64];`.
- The code reads data into this buffer based on the value of `Bitmap_File_Head.biSize`, which is controlled by the attacker. Specifically, the vulnerable code block is:
```c
else if (Bitmap_File_Head.biSize <= 64) /* Probably OS/2 2.x */
{
  if (!ReadOK (fd, buffer, Bitmap_File_Head.biSize - 4))
```
- If `Bitmap_File_Head.biSize` is set to 0, the read operation will try to read `0 - 4 = -4` bytes, which when interpreted as an unsigned number becomes a very large number causing the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When `autotrace` is compiled with `FORTIFY_SOURCE`, the buffer overflow is detected, and the program terminates, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). However, without `FORTIFY_SOURCE`, this buffer overflow could lead to more severe consequences, including arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious BMP file where the `biSize` field in the header is set to 0 or a very small value, triggering the overflow when `autotrace` processes the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted BMP file to `autotrace`. This could happen if a user opens such a file with `autotrace`, or if the application is processing files in an automated way. The attacker needs no special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was also present in GIMP but was accidentally fixed. Similar code is also found in sam2p.
- Red Hat Bugzilla Bug 951257 tracks this issue, and it's marked as "CLOSED WONTFIX"
- Fedora was affected and patches were released.
- A patch for the issue was proposed and sent upstream.
