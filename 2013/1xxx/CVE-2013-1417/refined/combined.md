Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------
Build documentation is in doc/html/build/index.html or
doc/pdf/build.pdf.
The installation guide is in doc/html/admin/install.html or
doc/pdf/install.pdf.
If you are attempting to build under Windows, please see the
src/windows/README file.
Reporting Bugs
--------------
Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program. The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).
If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.
You may view bug reports by visiting
http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/
and logging in as "guest" with password "guest".
DES transition
--------------
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is widely recognized as weak. The
krb5-1.7 release contains measures to encourage sites to migrate away
from using single-DES cryptosystems. Among these is a configuration
variable that enables "weak" enctypes, which defaults to "false"
beginning with krb5-1.8.

------------------------------------
\* Fix a KDC null pointer dereference [CVE-2013-1417] that could affect
realms with an uncommon configuration.
\* Fix a KDC null pointer dereference [CVE-2013-1418] that could affect
KDCs that serve multiple realms.

Additional background information on these changes may be found at
http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Release\_1.11
and
http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Category:Release\_1.11\_projects
Code quality:
\* Improve ASN.1 support code, making it table-driven for decoding as
well as encoding
\* Refactor parts of KDC
Developer experience:
\* Documentation consolidation
\* Add a new API krb5\_kt\_have\_content() to determine whether a keytab
exists and contains any entries.
\* Add a new API krb5\_cccol\_have\_content() to determine whether the
ccache collection contains any credentials.
\* Add a new API krb5\_kt\_client\_default() to resolve the default client
keytab.
\* Add new APIs gss\_export\_cred and gss\_import\_cred to serialize and
unserialize GSSAPI credentials.
\* Add a krb5\_get\_init\_creds\_opt\_set\_in\_ccache() option.
\* Add get\_cc\_config() and set\_cc\_config() clpreauth callbacks for
getting string attribute values from an in\_ccache and storing them
in an out\_ccache, respectively.
\* Add a plugin interface for GSSAPI interposer mechanisms.
\* Add an optional responder callback to the krb5\_get\_init\_creds
functions. The responder callback can consider and answer all
preauth-related questions at once, and can process more complicated
questions than the prompter.
\* Add a method to the clpreauth interface to allow modules to supply
response items for consideration by the responder callback.
\* Projects/Password\_response\_item
\* Add GSSAPI extensions to allow callers to specify credential store
locations when acquiring or storing credentials
\* Add a new API krb5\_kt\_client\_default() to resolve the default client
keytab.
Administrator experience:
\* Documentation consolidation
\* Add parameter expansion for default\_keytab\_name and
default\_client\_keytab\_name profile variables.
\* Add new default\_ccache\_name profile variable to override the
built-in default credential cache name.
\* Add configure-time support for changing the built-in ccache and
keytab names.
\* Add krb5-config options for displaying the built-in ccache and
keytab names.
\* In the default build, use the system's built-in ccache and keytab
names if they can be discovered using krb5-config.
\* Add support for a "default client keytab". Its location is
determined by the KRB5\_CLIENT\_KTNAME environment variable, the
default\_client\_keytab profile relation, or a hardcoded path (TBD).
\* GSSAPI initiator applications can now acquire credentials
automatically from the default client keytab, if one is available.
\* Add client support for FAST OTP (RFC 6560)
End-user experience:
\* Documentation consolidation
\* Store metadata in the ccache about how a credential was acquired, to
improve the user's experience when reacquiring
\* Projects/Extensible\_Policy
Performance:
\* Improve KDC lookaside cache performance
Protocol evolution:
\* Add client support for FAST OTP (RFC 6560)
\* Build Camellia encryption support by default

## Description

do\_tgs\_req.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.11 before 1.11.4, when a single-component realm name is used, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a TGS-REQ request that triggers an attempted cross-realm referral for a host-based service principal.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1030743#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-15 04:03:44 UTC  ``` From the upstream commit [1]:  An authenticated remote client can cause a KDC to crash by making a valid TGS-REQ to a KDC serving a realm with a single-component name. The process_tgs_req() function dereferences a null pointer because an unusual failure condition causes a helper function to return success.  While attempting to provide cross-realm referrals for host-based service principals, the find_referral_tgs() function could return a TGS principal for a zero-length realm name (indicating that the hostname in the service principal has no known realm associated with it).  Subsequently, the find_alternate_tgs() function would attempt to construct a path to this empty-string realm, and return success along with a null pointer in its output parameter.  This happens because krb5_walk_realm_tree() returns a list of length one when it attempts to construct a transit path between a single-component realm and the empty-string realm.  This list causes a loop in find_alternate_tgs() to iterate over zero elements, resulting in the unexpected output of a null pointer, which process_tgs_req() proceeds to dereference because there is no error condition.  Add an error condition to find_referral_tgs() when krb5_get_host_realm() returns an empty realm name.  Also add an error condition to find_alternate_tgs() to handle the length-one output from krb5_walk_realm_tree().  The vulnerable configuration is not likely to arise in practice. (Realm names that have a single component are likely to be test realms.)  Releases prior to krb5-1.11 are not vulnerable.  [1] <https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/4c023ba43c16396f0d199e2df1cfa59b88b62acc>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1030743#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-15 04:05:42 UTC  ``` This only affects Fedora 19 as Fedora 18 ships with an older version (pre 1.11.x).   Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of krb5 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1030743#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-15 04:06:47 UTC  ```  Created krb5 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-19 [[bug 1030744](show_bug.cgi?id=1030744 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1417 krb5: KDC null deref due to referrals [fedora-19]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1030743#c4)  Fedora Update System    2013-11-18 21:07:46 UTC  ``` krb5-1.11.3-32.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1030743#c5)  Fedora Update System    2013-12-03 10:37:29 UTC  ``` krb5-1.11.3-13.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

KDC null deref due to referrals [[CVE-2013-1417](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wfgh-cf33-x6c3 "CVE-2013-1417")]

```
An authenticated remote client can cause a KDC to crash by making a
valid TGS-REQ to a KDC serving a realm with a single-component name.
The process_tgs_req() function dereferences a null pointer because an
unusual failure condition causes a helper function to return success.

While attempting to provide cross-realm referrals for host-based
service principals, the find_referral_tgs() function could return a
TGS principal for a zero-length realm name (indicating that the
hostname in the service principal has no known realm associated with
it).

Subsequently, the find_alternate_tgs() function would attempt to
construct a path to this empty-string realm, and return success along
with a null pointer in its output parameter.  This happens because
krb5_walk_realm_tree() returns a list of length one when it attempts
to construct a transit path between a single-component realm and the
empty-string realm.  This list causes a loop in find_alternate_tgs()
to iterate over zero elements, resulting in the unexpected output of a
null pointer, which process_tgs_req() proceeds to dereference because
there is no error condition.

Add an error condition to find_referral_tgs() when
krb5_get_host_realm() returns an empty realm name.  Also add an error
condition to find_alternate_tgs() to handle the length-one output from
krb5_walk_realm_tree().

The vulnerable configuration is not likely to arise in practice.
(Realm names that have a single component are likely to be test
realms.)  Releases prior to krb5-1.11 are not vulnerable.

Thanks to Sol Jerome for reporting this problem.
