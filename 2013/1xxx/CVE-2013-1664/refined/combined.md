### Bug Description

Jonathan Murray from NCC Group reported that you can DoS keystone servers using XML entities in Keystone requests.

[ Joshua Harlow from Yahoo! independently reported the same issue plaguing Nova (using minidom). ]

POST /v2.0/tokens HTTP/1.1

content-type: application/xml

<!DOCTYPE foo [

<!ENTITY a "AAAA lots of As AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvAAAAAAAAAA" >

<!ENTITY b "&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;" >

<!ENTITY c "&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;" >

]>

<auth>

<tenantName>&c;</tenantName>

<passwordCredentials>

<username>&c;</username>

<username>&c;</username>

<username>&c;</username>

<username>&c;</username>

<password>&c;</password>

<somethingElse>&c;</somethingElse>

<somethingElse1>&c;</somethingElse1>

<somethingElse2>&c;</somethingElse2>

</passwordCredentials>

</auth>

In that precise case it might be an issue with the XML library we use, although it sounds generally safer to disable parsing ENTITY blocks entirely if we can.

Looks like we could pass an etree.XMLParser with resolve\_entities=False to etree.fromstring. Thoughts ?

I wrote a 4KB request similar to the above that took about 10 minutes to consume > 1 GB server memory.

Thierry's suggestion fixes the DoS vulnerability, but then the same request will still return a 500 as the subsequent code doesn't know how to deal with XML Entities.

The attached patch completely ignores XML entities, comments, and processing instructions -- the sample request above now results in a quick 401 Unauthorized, as expected.

Awesome, Dolph! keystone-core please +1 the proposed patches.

Anyone with spare cycles to check which OTHER openstack projects are affected by the same issue ?

lxml is used in cinder, glance, nova and oslo. If affected I'd rather do them all in one go.

========

Title: Information leak and Denial of Service using XML entities

Reporter: Jonathan Murray (NCC Group)

Products: Keystone

Affects: All versions

Description:

Jonathan Murray from NCC Group reported a vulnerability in the parsing of XML requests in Keystone. By using entities in XML requests, an unauthenticated attacker may crash the Keystone API server, resulting in a denial of service. Authenticated attackers may also leverage XML entities to read the content of a local file on the Keystone API server.

=========

Ramdom questions: there is no way of disabling XML requests completely, right ?

Since essex, there is definitely a way to disable XML. We opt to translate XML<-->JSON in middleware so that the application itself only has to speak JSON.

It's included by keystone.conf.sample, but you can remove the keystone.middleware:XmlBodyMiddleware from your application pipelines to completely disable XML support.

I think the description is accurate, but you could be more specific, I suppose. Instead of:

> an unauthenticated attacker may crash the Keystone API server, resulting in a denial of service.

... change to:

> an unauthenticated attacker may consume excessive resources on the Keystone API server, resulting in a denial of service and potentially a crash.

I'm running similar requests on Fedora and I can't seem to reproduce this. I'm wondering if the underlying version of python-lxml is also part of what is causing the problems.

[root@nova1 ~]# rpm -qi python-lxml

Name : python-lxml

Version : 2.3.3

Which version are you guys using?

ttx:

I tested this today with Nova using a similar XML request (lots of entity expansions) and cause the same exploit. Essentially the request took forever and pegged the CPU on the machine.

We are going to need a different fix in Nova though because minidom is actually the XML call we use there:

dom = minidom.parseString(body)

Both Cinder and Quantum will have similar issues due to the fact that they use minidom.parseString as well. So whatever we do to fix minidom in Nova should work there as well.

From what I can tell Glance is clean though.

----

I'm looking into a fix for the minidom issue... shall I post the patches into this ticket?

It also looks like this may affect libraries other than minidom. The python-dev team (Christian Heimes) is working on a patch. I would imagine we could get a copy of that patch if we contact them.

This example causes the expat library to turn off entity expansion.

Looking at the c code there is an odd section that this causes to run.

void XMLCALL

XML\_SetDefaultHandler(XML\_Parser parser,

                      XML\_DefaultHandler handler)

{

  defaultHandler = handler;

  defaultExpandInternalEntities = XML\_FALSE;

}

Basically be setting the default handler to anything it will cause expansion to stop.

Normal xml documents seem to flow through just fine.

We could just monkey-patch the previous SafeExpatParser over the ExpatParser and all minidom calls should proceed without expansion, thats one way (or people can be forced to use this parser, wherever a parse occurs).

This fix is a little different, just by causing the C function to be activated (and then restoring the previous handler) will accomplish the same goal (odd stuff....)

@Doug: I'm not sure this should be considered a Python vulnerability, unless there is no way of disabling parsing of extensions in minidom. You could argue that the default should be safer, or that documentation should be clearer...

Who do you recommend we talk to at this point ? Security team ? Christian (email?) ?

@Thierry, Based on the informal conversation I had with Jesse Noller yesterday I definitely recommend contacting the security team. Given that they are working on some sort of patch already, they may have done analysis that tells them this is an issue with the stdlib. At the very least the example cases uncovered by this bug report could give them more tests for that patch. If it turns out the solution is better runtime configuration, we may be able to influence their default settings or the API for configuring the parser.

In any case, Jesse strongly encouraged us to talk to them. I would do it, but it would be better for someone with stronger knowledge of the issue to have that conversation.

So a little of how I traced this down.

- Figured out what exactly the minidom parseString was doing when it created a parser (when none was provided).

  - This seemed to then go into the code @ <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/xml/dom/minidom.py?revision=75305&view=markup#l1917>

  - Note that it seems to jump into 2 different DOM impls depending on if a parser is provided or not so first I tried to see if I could

    monkey-patch out the parser it was 'creating' when no parser was selected, basically by trying to patch out the function @

    <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/xml/dom/expatbuilder.py?revision=50941&view=markup#l932>

  - This is how I then noticed that <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/xml/dom/expatbuilder.py?revision=50941&view=markup#l155>

    is what is actually creating the underlying parser (so I was trying to then adjust settings in that underlying parser that would

    make it work like we expected). This is where I realized that self.\_parser.SetParamEntityParsing(expat.XML\_PARAM\_ENTITY\_PARSING\_NEVER)

    isn't actually doing anything, I didn't dive to much into the C code to figure out exactly why this call isn't actually changing anything

    but from initial dive I found <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/expat/xmlparse.c?view=markup#l2215> which seems to be the

    entity expansion/reference code, note from that code there is logic around 'XML\_ERROR\_RECURSIVE\_ENTITY\_REF;' but this doesn't stop the

    case we are seeing that actually isn't recursive. This code then eventually calls <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/expat/xmlparse.c?view=markup#l4665>

    which then starts the whole 'doContent()' function over again.

  - So then I was looking back at that C code @ line <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/expat/xmlparse.c?view=markup#l2225>

    and was like it seems to be checking 'else if (defaultHandler)' and then stopping entity expansion right there if said handler actually

    exists, which I was like well thats odd. So then I started seeing about replacing this default handler (which apparently does not exist

    on said parsers unless set). This is how I then started looking at <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/expat/xmlparse.c?revision=77680&view=markup#l1271>

    and seeing if I could just set any handler on this parser to stop it from doing what it was doing, so this is how I discovered that setting any

    default handler will cause 'defaultExpandInternalEntities = XML\_TRUE;' to be called, which is then how i stumbled upon

    <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/expat/xmlparse.c?view=markup#l2257> and this resulted in me messing with the default handler to see what I could

    set (anything actually) to turn off entity expansion.

@harlowja: Thanks for the info.

@ttx: I've had similar luck in trying to get minidom to stop parsing XML entities. Nothing obvious seems to work... What Josh posted in fix.py definately stops entity expansion. This approach definately falls into the "work around" category but given the lack of a better solution I'd say we go with it for now. If we get a better solution from the Python security team we can drop it in as a replacement too. I'm going to post some Nova patches which use this approach for Grizzly (above), Folsom, and Essex this afternoon.

I also tried tracking down a little of what the 3 enums were doing @ <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/expat/expat.h?revision=47033&view=markup#l853> but didn't go to far, I tried seeing if somehow those enums weren't getting mapped correctly (they should be 0, 1, 2 in typical c compilers) but that didn't change anything.

Some points these affect:

<http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/expat/xmlparse.c?revision=77680&view=markup#l1409>

The only real place this seems used:

<http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/expat/xmlparse.c?revision=77680&view=markup#l3328>

Note that its not used in the actual doContent function, <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/expat/xmlparse.c?revision=77680&view=markup#l2139> but I might have missed something.

Hello,

I'm a Python core developer and member of the Python Security Response Team. I have found the vulnerability in Python's standard library XML parser and libexpat a couple of months ago. I have been working on a patch for a while but the patch is not ready yet. The libexpat and stdlib's XML parser are vulnerable to three kinds of XML attacks related to inline DTDs and ENTITY.

A quick and dirty workaround is to reject all XML data that contain the strings '<!ENTITY' and its utf-16-be, utf-16-le and utf-32 variants. That may generate false positive hits in CDATA sections but the likelihood is very small. Your code should also limit the maximum length of the input string and make sure it's not vulnerable to gzip bombs.

I'm going to read this thread now ...

Two quicks comments.

1) It's sufficient and a little bit faster to write:

class ExpatParserNoEntity(ExpatParser):

    def reset(self):

        ExpatParser.reset(self)

        self.\_parser.DefaultHandler = None

None disables the feature completely

2) You should definitely disable entity expansion in LXML. Although libxml2 protects from excessive exponential expansion it's still vulnerable to quadratic blowup. I'm in contact with a libxml2 developer.

I compared your patches with my patch for Python's standard library. Your approach seems to work well but I'm not sure if it intercepts all possible attacks. When you overwrite DefaultHandler you don't get any error messages when an entity occurs in the XML document.

I like to suggest a different approach. You can either reject all XML documents with an inline DTD (SOAP does it) or you can disallow entity declarations:

class ProtectedExpatParser(ExpatParser):

    def \_\_init\_\_(self, forbid\_dtd=True, forbid\_entities=True,

                 \*args, \*\*kwargs):

        # Python 2.x old style class

        ExpatParser.\_\_init\_\_(self, \*args, \*\*kwargs)

        self.forbid\_dtd = forbid\_dtd

        self.forbid\_entities = forbid\_entities

def start\_doctype\_decl(self, name, sysid, pubid, has\_internal\_subset):

        raise ValueError("Inline DTD forbidden")

def entity\_decl(self, entityName, is\_parameter\_entity, value, base, systemId, publicId, notationName):

        raise ValueError("<!ENTITY> forbidden")

def unparsed\_entity\_decl(self, name, base, sysid, pubid, notation\_name):

        # expat 1.2

        raise ValueError("<!ENTITY> forbidden")

def reset(self):

        ExpatParser.reset(self)

        if self.forbid\_dtd:

            self.\_parser.StartDoctypeDeclHandler = self.start\_doctype\_decl

        if self.forbid\_entities:

            self.\_parser.EntityDeclHandler = self.entity\_decl

            self.\_parser.UnparsedEntityDeclHandler = self.unparsed\_entity\_decl

With this parser errors and attacks aren't ignored silently.

Your fix for LXML may contain a flaw, too. LXML used to have an issue when parser is shared by multiple threads. I don't know if your are using threads nor if LXML still has a problem with shared parser instances. At work we are using a thread local storage to have a parser context for each thread.

raise ValueError("Inline DTD forbidden")
def entity\_decl(self, entityName, is\_parameter\_entity, value, base, systemId, publicId, notationName):

if self.forbid\_dtd:
self.\_parser.StartDoctypeDeclHandler = self.start\_doctype\_decl

self.\_parser.UnparsedEntityDeclHandler = self.unparsed\_entity\_decl

Christian:

Thanks for having a look at this. ProtectedExpatParser looks good to me, is self documenting, and I like that it doesn't silently ignore things as well. Thanks for this.

ttx: The incoming Nova patches use the new ProtectedExpatParser implementation...

ttx: Okay. Cinder patches are attached.

Also, I looked again and although Quantum calls minidom.parse... once in wsgi.py it doesn't appear to be used. Note: We will certainly need the etree fix to be added once this hits: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/19998/13/quantum/wsgi.py> (upstream branch under review to add XML support for the Quantum V2 API).

I think olso can wait till after we disclose this right?

@Dan: Thx for the updated patches. Agree that Oslo can be fixed after disclosure.

@Christian: Thx for reaching out, still busy traveling back from FOSDEM and will be fully up to speed again starting Wednesday. I'm handling the disclosure process for this bug and I was wondering if we (OpenStack) can proceed in responsible disclosure or if you wanted to coordinate the python stdlib security fix(es) with ours. I see some urgency in the fact that this issue was independently reported to us 4 times over the last two weeks, which means there is research/pentest activity around this. How far are you from public disclosure on your side ?

LXML still suggests a parser pool for threaded applications.

<http://lxml.de/element_classes.html>

To avoid interfering with other modules, however, it is usually a better idea to use a dedicated parser for each module (or a parser pool when using threads) and then register the required lookup scheme only for this parser.

Here is some example code from our code at work. We are using a custom Element class and thread local storage for parser instances.

import threading

from lxml import etree

class RestrictedElement(etree.ElementBase):

    \_\_slots\_\_ = ()

    # blacklist = (etree.\_Element, etree.\_ProcessingInstruction, etree.\_Comment)

    blacklist = etree.\_Element

def \_\_iter\_\_(self):

        blacklist = self.blacklist

        for child in super(RestrictedElement, self).\_\_iter\_\_():

            if isinstance(child, blacklist):

                continue

            yield child

def iterchildren(self, tag=None, reversed=False):

        blacklist = self.blacklist

        children = super(RestrictedElement, self).iterchildren(tag=tag,

                                                               reversed=reversed)

        for child in children:

            if isinstance(child, blacklist):

                continue

            yield child

# you may need to overwrite getchildren, find, findall and more if you use them

class ParserTLS(threading.local):

    parser\_cfg = {

        'resolve\_entities': False,

        'remove\_comments': True,

        'remove\_pis': True,

    }

@property

    def parser(self):

        parser = getattr(self, "\_parser", None)

        if parser is None:

            parser = etree.XMLParser(\*\*self.parser\_cfg)

            lookup = etree.ElementDefaultClassLookup(element=RestrictedElement)

            parser.set\_element\_class\_lookup(lookup)

            self.\_parser = parser

        return parser

if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_":

    tls = ParserTLS()

    tree = etree.parse("test.xml", parser=tls.parser)

    print tree.getroot().text

    print list(tree.getroot().iterchildren())

@Thierry:

I'll ask on the PSRT list. My patch for expat won't be ready until Wednesday but we can release the restricted expat parsers classes for etree, sax and minidom as hotfixes. I'm waiting for some code review now. I also need to get back to the libxml2 guys ASAP.

@Christian: let me explain our disclosure system to see how we can align.

We push the patches to a set of downstream stakeholders (think distros) so that they can coordinate their own updates with ours. That restricted disclosure window usually lasts 3-5 business days, and then we push the patches publicly. So it would be great to come up with a common "public date" and then we can align our responsible disclosure process to that. For example if we agree we can go public Tuesday next week, I can send patches to the distros wednesday. Let me know what public date sounds doable for the Python side.

Please see proposed description:

-------------

Title: Information leak and Denial of Service using XML entities

Reporter: Jonathan Murray (NCC Group), Joshua Harlow (Yahoo!)

Products: Keystone, Nova, Cinder

Affects: All versions

Description:

Jonathan Murray from NCC Group and Joshua Harlow from Yahoo! independently reported a vulnerability in the parsing of XML requests in Keystone. By using entities in XML requests, an unauthenticated attacker may consume excessive resources on the Keystone, Nova or Cinder API servers, resulting in a denial of service and potentially a crash. Authenticated attackers may also leverage XML entities to read the content of a local file on the Keystone API server. This only affects servers with XML support enabled.

Quantum Grizzly is now affected (since yesterday) so patch should be ported to it... however it should not block security fix since it only affects version under development.

Have you taken care of lxml, too? I just noticed that lxml always resolves and loads external entities with file:// URLs. An attacker can possibly load and retrieve all (XML) files that the service is allowed to access.

Example:

external\_file.xml

==============

<!DOCTYPE external [

<!ENTITY ee SYSTEM "file:///PATH/TO/simple.xml">

]>

<root>&ee;</root>

simple.xml

=========

<!-- comment -->

<root>

   <element key='value'>text</element>

   <element>text</element>tail

   <empty-element/>

</root>

>>> from lxml import etree

>>> tree = etree.parse("external\_file.xml")

>>> print(etree.tostring(tree))

<root><!-- comment -->

<root>

   <element key="value">text</element>

   <element>text</element>tail

   <empty-element/>

</root>

commit 59933249054bf71ec963585198583fe78050c9d6

Author: Dan Prince <email address hidden>

Date: Fri Feb 1 17:04:27 2013 -0500

Add a safe\_minidom\_parse\_string function.

Adds a new utils.safe\_minidom\_parse\_string function and

    updates external API facing Nova modules to use it.

    This ensures we have safe defaults on our incoming API XML parsing.

Internally safe\_minidom\_parse\_string uses a ProtectedExpatParser

    class to disable DTDs and entities from being parsed when using

    minidom.

Fixes LP [Bug #1100282](/bugs/1100282).

commit 1f716e3effe1ad6eeb042a11f06a5c89498a34b8

Author: Davanum Srinivas <email address hidden>

Date: Tue Feb 26 15:43:50 2013 -0500

Prevent DoS through XML entity expansion

Add a ProtectedXMLParser that overrides the

    doctype declaration handler. The handler simply

    throws an exception and prevents any further

    parsing of the incoming xml.

Fixes LP [Bug #1100282](/bugs/1100282)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=910224#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-12 04:00:02 UTC  ```  Thierry Carrez (thierry) reports:  Title: Information leak and Denial of Service using XML entities Reporter: Jonathan Murray (NCC Group), Joshua Harlow (Yahoo!), Stuart Stent Products: Keystone, Nova, Cinder Affects: All versions  Description: Jonathan Murray from NCC Group, Joshua Harlow from Yahoo! and Stuart Stent independently reported a vulnerability in the parsing of XML requests in Keystone, Nova and Cinder. By using entities in XML requests, an unauthenticated attacker may consume excessive resources on the Keystone, Nova or Cinder API servers, resulting in a denial of service and potentially a crash. This only affects servers with XML  support enabled.  Proposed patches: See attached patches for current development tree (Grizzly) and the Folsom and Essex series for each of the affected projects. Unless a flaw is discovered in them, these proposed patches will be merged to master, stable/folsom and stable/essex branches on the public disclosure date.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=910224#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-12 04:01:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 696367](attachment.cgi?id=696367&action=diff "nova-essex-CVE-2013-0280.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=696367&action=edit "nova-essex-CVE-2013-0280.patch") nova-essex-CVE-2013-0280.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=910224#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-12 04:01:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 696368](attachment.cgi?id=696368&action=diff "nova-folsom-CVE-2013-0280.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=696368&action=edit "nova-folsom-CVE-2013-0280.patch") nova-folsom-CVE-2013-0280.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=910224#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-12 04:02:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 696369](attachment.cgi?id=696369&action=diff "nova-grizzly-CVE-2013-0280.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=696369&action=edit "nova-grizzly-CVE-2013-0280.patch") nova-grizzly-CVE-2013-0280.patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=910224#c7)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-19 19:05:18 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-announce/2013-February/000078.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=910224#c8)  Alan Pevec    2013-02-19 23:16:39 UTC  ``` NB: use [CVE-2013-1664](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1664), [CVE-2013-1665](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1665) for OpenStack (see [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=910221#c7](show_bug.cgi?id=910221#c7 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2013-1664 CVE-2013-1665 OpenStack keystone: XML entity parsing"))   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=910224#c10)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-20 05:10:12 UTC  ``` See [bug 912400](show_bug.cgi?id=912400 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-0338 libxml2: CPU consumption DoS when performing string substitutions during entities expansion") which was filed for CVE-2013-166[45].

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=912982#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-20 05:47:04 UTC  ``` Christian Heimes <christian> reports:  Entity declarations can contain more than just text for replacement. They can  also point to external resources by public identifiers or system identifiers.  System identifiers are standard URIs. When the URI is a URL (e.g. a http://  locator) some parsers download the resource from the remote location and embed  them into the XML document verbatim.  Using External entity expansion opens the door to plenty of exploits. An attacker can abuse a vulnerable XML library and application to rebound and forward network  requests with the IP address of the server. It highly depends on the parser and  the application what kind of exploit is possible. For example:  * An attacker can circumvent firewalls and gain access to restricted resources as  all the requests are made from an internal and trustworthy IP address, not from  the outside. * An attacker can abuse a service to attack, spy on or DoS your servers but also  third party services. The attack is disguised with the IP address of the server  and the attacker is able to utilize the high bandwidth of a big machine. * An attacker can exhaust additional resources on the machine, e.g. with requests  to a service that doesn't respond or responds with very large files. * An attacker may gain knowledge, when, how often and from which IP address a XML  document is accessed. * An attacker could send mail from inside your network if the URL handler  supports smtp:// URIs.  External reference: <http://blog.python.org/2013/02/announcing-defusedxml-fixes-for-xml.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=912982#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-05 21:01:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack Folsom for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0596 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0596.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=912982#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-21 18:12:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack Folsom for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0670 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0670.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=912982#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-21 18:13:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack Folsom for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0658 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0658.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=912982#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-21 18:16:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack Folsom for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0657 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0657.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=912982#c12)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-08-03 06:21:17 UTC  ``` Python’s interfaces for processing XML are grouped in the xml module, which is a part of the python package. The XML modules are not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data, and such data should not be directly parsed via python's xml modules.  This is clearly documented at: <https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.html> <https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.html#xml-vulnerabilities>  Python upstream suggests the use of "defusedxml" packages, but they break backward compatibility.   Statement:  This issue affects the versions of python as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=914759#c0)  Russell Bryant    2013-02-22 17:08:32 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The openstack-nova package was recently updated to have a nova-dist.conf file that includes distribution default values for configuration options.  Nova services read both /etc/nova/nova.conf and /usr/share/nova/nova-dist.conf.  Nova also includes a binary called nova-dhcpbridge.  This is executed by dnsmasq.  The configuration file that nova-dhcpbridge uses is passed to it via an environment variable.  The environment variable is populated with the value of the dhcpbridge_flagfile nova configuration option.  The problem is that only one configuration file can be specified in this option.  We need to support two.  My thoughts on fixing this ...  1) Convert the dhcpbridge_flagfile option to a MultiStrOpt, which allows a list of values.  2) Update our nova-dist.conf to set this option with both /usr/share/nova/nova-dist.conf and /etc/nova/nova.conf.  3) Update bin/nova-dhcpbridge to be able to handle receiving multiple configuration files in the FLAGFILE env var.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=914759#c1)  Russell Bryant    2013-02-22 17:10:26 UTC  ``` I think the code changes (not the nova-dist.conf update) make sense to submit for master upstream.  It probably won't make sense to backport to stable/folsom upstream, so we'll have to carry it as a patch.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=914759#c6)  Kashyap Chamarthy    2013-03-20 07:18:47 UTC  ``` VERIFIED.   1] Version info: #-------------# $ cat /etc/redhat-release ; arch Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.4 (Santiago) x86_64 #-------------#   Verification info: =================  2] grep the nova-dist.conf file, it's updated with both the values used by dhcpbridge_flagfile ( because now, it's converted to use a MultiStrOpt, so it takes multiple values)  #-------------# $ sudo grep dhcpbridge_flagfile /usr/share/nova/nova-dist.conf  dhcpbridge_flagfile = /usr/share/nova/nova-dist.conf dhcpbridge_flagfile = /etc/nova/nova.conf #-------------#   3] Relevant code fragment from the patch referenced.  3.1] For the MultiStrOpt: #-------------# . .     cfg.MultiStrOpt('dhcpbridge_flagfile',                default='[/etc/nova/nova-dhcpbridge.conf]',                help='location of flagfile for dhcpbridge'), . . #-------------#  3.2] bin/nova-dhcpbridge indicating the ability to take multiple values via flagfile env var: #-------------# . .

Message-ID: <5123C761.50105@redhat.com>
Date: Tue, 19 Feb 2013 11:41:37 -0700
From: Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com>

Subject: REJECT CVE-2013-0278, CVE-2013-0279 and CVE-2013-0280

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

- From Thierry Carrez:
====
After discussion with the Python security team and Kurt, we'll use the
following common CVEs:

CVE-2013-1664 Unrestricted entity expansion induces DoS
vulnerabilities in Python XML libraries (XML bomb)
^ affects Keystone, Cinder, Nova

CVE-2013-1665 External entity expansion in Python XML libraries
inflicts potential security flaws and DoS vulnerabilities
^ affects Keystone

The vulnerabilities are actually in those Python libraries, they are
just being worked around in OpenStack patches. The description will be
updated to clarify this (see below).
====

As you can see from the advisories:

<http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q1/338>
CVE: CVE-2013-1664, CVE-2013-1665

They were correctly referenced in the OpenStack advisories, however
the CVE's did get used elsewhere:

<http://blog.python.org/2013/02/announcing-defusedxml-fixes-for-xml.html>

CVE-2013-0278
    OpenStack Keystone
CVE-2013-0279
    Cinder
CVE-2013-0280
    Nova

So please REJECT CVE-2013-0278, CVE-2013-0279 and CVE-2013-0280 and
use CVE-2013-1664, CVE-2013-1665 as appropriate instead to identify
these issues. Sorry for the confusion.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=910222#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-12 03:58:07 UTC  ```  Thierry Carrez (thierry) reports:  Title: Information leak and Denial of Service using XML entities Reporter: Jonathan Murray (NCC Group), Joshua Harlow (Yahoo!), Stuart Stent Products: Keystone, Nova, Cinder Affects: All versions  Description: Jonathan Murray from NCC Group, Joshua Harlow from Yahoo! and Stuart Stent independently reported a vulnerability in the parsing of XML requests in Keystone, Nova and Cinder. By using entities in XML requests, an unauthenticated attacker may consume excessive resources on the Keystone, Nova or Cinder API servers, resulting in a denial of service and potentially a crash. This only affects servers with XML  support enabled.  Proposed patches: See attached patches for current development tree (Grizzly) and the Folsom and Essex series for each of the affected projects. Unless a flaw is discovered in them, these proposed patches will be merged to master, stable/folsom and stable/essex branches on the public disclosure date.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=910222#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-12 03:58:43 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 696353](attachment.cgi?id=696353&action=diff "cinder-folsom-CVE-2013-0279.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=696353&action=edit "cinder-folsom-CVE-2013-0279.patch") cinder-folsom-CVE-2013-0279.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=910222#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-12 03:58:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 696354](attachment.cgi?id=696354&action=diff "cinder-grizzly-CVE-2013-0279.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=696354&action=edit "cinder-grizzly-CVE-2013-0279.patch") cinder-grizzly-CVE-2013-0279.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=910222#c4)  Alan Pevec    2013-02-19 23:11:28 UTC  ``` Published today <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-announce/2013-February/000078.html> NB: use [CVE-2013-1664](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1664), [CVE-2013-1665](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1665) for OpenStack (see [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=910221#c7](show_bug.cgi?id=910221#c7 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2013-1664 CVE-2013-1665 OpenStack keystone: XML entity parsing"))   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=910222#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-21 18:13:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack Folsom for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0658 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0658.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=913042#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-20 09:31:17 UTC  ```  James Bennett of Django reports:  Django's form library includes tools for generating formsets -- multiple instances of a single form, to be submitted simultaneously (e.g., for mass editing/updating of similar objects). Formsets allow a parameter, max_num, specifying the maximum number of individual forms which may be displayed. A hidden input in the formset then specifies the number of forms being submitted.  Django accepts the submitted hidden value, and attempts to instantiate that many form objects. Sufficiently large values will result in extreme memory consumption; values exceeding sys.maxint will, in this case, result in an HTTP 500 response (due to an uncaught OverflowError from the over-large value). In the former case, the result is an effective denial-of-service attack. In the latter, an attacker can cause arbitrary server errors.  To resolve this, Django will now supply a (suitably large) default value for the maximum number of forms, which will be used when max_num is not supplied. Application developers can still manually specify max_num to suit the needs of their applications, but absent this the default value -- 1000 -- will ensure that attackers cannot cause overflow errors or excessive memory consumption.

| ``` I did a rough merge with current “default” (3.5 pre-release) branch so that I can have a closer look at this issue; see xmlbomb_20150518.patch for the result. There are some bits with Argument Clinit that need perfecting:  * Unsure how to convert the ElementTree.XMLParser.__init__() signature (varied depending on XML_BOMB_PROTECTION compile-time flag) to Argument Clinic. So I just hard-coded it as if XML_BOMB_PROTECTION is always enabled. Why do we have to have a variable signature in the first place?  * New pyexpat functions need porting to Argument Clinic. ``` | | | |

| ``` I started looking at the lower Expat-level changes. Here are some thoughts, in the order that I thought them. :) But the end result is to investigate a different approach to disable entities in existing versions of Expat.  Currently, it looks like max_entity_indirections = 0 is a special value meaning no limit. I think it would be better to use some other value such as None for this, and then 0 could disable all entity expansion (other than pre-defined entities like &amp; &#xNNNN; etc).  What is the benefit of having the indirection limit? I would have thought the entity expansion (character) limit on its own would already be effective at preventing nested expansion attacks like “billion laughs”. Even if the entity expanded to an empty string, all of the intermediate entity references are still included in the character count.  I wonder if it would make more sense to have a total character limit instead, which would include the characters from custom entity expansions as already counted by the patch, but also count characters directly from the XML body. Why would you want to avoid 8 million characters from entity expansion, but allow 8 million characters of plain XML (or gzipped XML)? (I am not an XML expert, so I could be missing something obvious here.)  Now I have discovered that it seems you can build Python to use an external Expat library, which won’t be affected by Christian’s fix (correct me if I am wrong). I think we should find a different solution that will also work with existing external Expat versions. Maybe setting EntityDeclHandler to raise an error would be good enough:  >>> from xml.parsers import expat >>> bomb = '<!DOCTYPE bomb [\n<!ENTITY a "" >\n<!ENTITY b "' + '&a;' * 1000 + '" >\n<!ENTITY c "' + '&b;' * 1000 + '" >\n]>\n<bomb a="' + '&c;' * 10 + '" />\n' >>> p = expat.ParserCreate() >>> p.Parse(bomb, True)  # Noticeable delay (DOS) while parsing 1 >>> p = expat.ParserCreate() >>> def handler(*so_much_argh): ...     raise ValueError("Entity handling disabled") ...  >>> p.EntityDeclHandler = handler >>> p.Parse(bomb, True)  # Instant failure (no DOS) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "/build/python/src/Python-3.4.3/Modules/pyexpat.c", line 494, in EntityDecl   File "<stdin>", line 2, in handler ValueError: Entity handling disabled  This solution has been suggested and implemented elsewhere: * <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1000109#c1> * [http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/apr-dev/200906.mbox/%3C20090602162934.GA28360@redhat.com%3E](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/apr-dev/200906.mbox/%3C20090602162934.GA28360%40redhat.com%3E) (though I suspect the SetDefaultHandler option there is not sufficient) ``` | | | |

| ``` I have opened [Issue 24238](issue24238 "[open] Avoid entity expansion attacks in Element Tree") with a patch for Element Tree that uses my EntityDeclHandler technique, instead of patching Expat. I would be interested in other people’s thoughts on the approach. ``` | | | |

| ``` This issue didn't get much attention in 5 years. The XML documentation starts with a big red warning: <https://docs.python.org/dev/library/xml.html>  The warning is present in 2.7 and 3.4 as well: <https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/xml.html> <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/xml.html>  It seems like XML is getting less popular because of JSON becoming more popular (JSON obviously comes with its own set of security issues). It seems like less core developers care about XML.  I suggest to:  * close [bpo-17318](issue17318 "[closed] xml.sax and xml.dom fetch DTDs by default") as a duplicate of this issue ([bpo-17239](issue17239 "[open] XML vulnerabilities in Python")) * close [bpo-24238](issue24238 "[open] Avoid entity expansion attacks in Element Tree") * close this issue  We just have to accept that core developers have limited availability and that documenting security issues is an acceptable tradeoff. I don't see any value of keeping these 3 issues open. ``` | | | |

I don't see any reason to wait on another group to "release" it when we need to manually apply the update to our own repo anyway.  My policy is upstream fix: first, get a change merged upstream.  If we start with a downstream patch:  * only Windows and macOS will get the fix * upstream may require changes making the change incompatible, for example change the default limits * I would prefer to keep [Modules/expat/](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/expat/) as close as possible to the upstream  Python is vulnerable for years, it's not like there is an urgency to fix it. ``` | | | |

| ``` There's also the view that it'll be easier to justify upstreaming a patch if it's been released and tested in a separate app. We require that all the time for Python patches, so why should we expect other projects to be different?  We're totally entitled to only release it for those platforms, because we are responsible for libexpat on those (we could vendor it for all of them? Or switch to platform-supported libraries for macOS and Windows?)  Who normally updates the vendored libexpat? I'd rather let them make the call on how far to diverge from upstream, since it'll be up to them to roll the changes forward or revert them in favour of upstream. I doubt different defaults will be an issue, especially since they aren't configurable anyway. ``` | | | |

| ``` > * only Windows and macOS will get the fix  [Modules/expat](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/expat) can be used on all platforms. A downstream patch is only a problem for platforms that compile Python with "./configure --with-system-expat".  The security fixes for entity expansion blowup and external entity loading are backwards incompatible fixes. Technically they also violate XML standards. In practice the vast majority of users will never run into the issue, because external entities are scarcely used. The expat parser is a non-validating XML parser, so DTDs aren't useful at all. I'd rather break a handful of users than to keep the majority of users vulnerable.  To fix billion laughs and quadratic blowup once and for all, we also have to break backwards compatibility and require expat >= 2.3.0. For now the modules still work with old versions of expat. IMO it's fine. Vendors either have to update their libraries or use our copy of expat.  Ultimately it's Benjamin's, Larry's, and Ned's decision. They are release managers. ``` | | | |

[bpo-30694](issue30694 "[closed] Update embedded copy of expat to 2.2.1") (expat 2.2.1):  * I wrote a script to rebuild [Modules/expat/](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/expat/) from the upstream code * I had to manually keep our old pyexpatns.h file since it's a downstream change * Then you have to add againt #include "pyexpatns.h" in [Modules/expat/expat_external.h](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/expat/expat_external.h) * It broke buildbots: [bpo-29591](issue29591 "[closed] expat 2.2.0: Various security vulnerabilities in bundled expat (CVE-2016-0718 and CVE-2016-4472)") * The change introduced a compilation warning: [bpo-30797](issue30797 "[closed] ./pyconfig.h:1438:0: warning: '_GNU_SOURCE' redefined [enabled by default]")  [bpo-30947](issue30947 "[closed] Update embeded copy of libexpat from 2.2.1 to 2.2.3") (expat 2.2.3):  * "If libexpat is upgraded in Python 2.7, the new [Modules/expat/loadlibrary.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/expat/loadlibrary.c) should also be added to [PC/VS9.0/](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/PC/VS9.0/) project files, as I did for PCbuild." * "Expat 2.2.3 has a bug: see [bpo-31170](issue31170 "[closed] Update to expat 2.2.4 (expat: utf8_toUtf8 cannot properly handle exhausting buffer)") :-(" * etc.  There are different issues:  * We have some small downstream changes * We still support VS 2008 for Python 2.7 whereas upstream doesn't care of this old legacy compiler * Each release introduces its own set of bugs :-D * Each release comes with its own set of new warnings...  At least for me, each update was painful. It's also painful to have to make the same change in all supported branches (2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, master). ``` | | | |

Subject: [OSSA 2013-004] Information leak and Denial of Service using XML
 entities (CVE-2013-1664, CVE-2013-1665)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-004
CVE: CVE-2013-1664, CVE-2013-1665
Date: February 19, 2013
Title: Information leak and Denial of Service using XML entities
Reporter: Jonathan Murray (NCC Group), Joshua Harlow (Yahoo!), Stuart
Stent
Products: Keystone, Nova, Cinder (see note)
Affects: All versions

Description:
Jonathan Murray from NCC Group, Joshua Harlow from Yahoo! and Stuart
Stent independently reported a vulnerabilities in the parsing of XML
requests in Python XML libraries used in Keystone, Nova and Cinder. By
using entities in XML requests, an unauthenticated attacker may consume
excessive resources on the Keystone, Nova or Cinder API servers,
resulting in a denial of service and potentially a crash
(CVE-2013-1664). Authenticated attackers may also leverage XML entities
to read the content of a local file on the Keystone API server
(CVE-2013-1665). This only affects servers with XML support enabled.

Note:
The vulnerabilities are actually in the various affected Python XML
libraries, but we provide OpenStack patches working around the issues.

Grizzly (development branch) fixes:
Nova: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22309/>
Cinder: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22310/>
Keystone: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22315/>

Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-004
CVE: CVE-2013-1664, CVE-2013-1665
Date: February 19, 2013
Title: Information leak and Denial of Service using XML entities
Reporter: Jonathan Murray (NCC Group), Joshua Harlow (Yahoo!), Stuart
Stent
Products: Keystone, Nova, Cinder (see note)
Affects: All versions

Description:
Jonathan Murray from NCC Group, Joshua Harlow from Yahoo! and Stuart
Stent independently reported a vulnerabilities in the parsing of XML
requests in Python XML libraries used in Keystone, Nova and Cinder. By
using entities in XML requests, an unauthenticated attacker may consume
excessive resources on the Keystone, Nova or Cinder API servers,
resulting in a denial of service and potentially a crash
(CVE-2013-1664). Authenticated attackers may also leverage XML entities
to read the content of a local file on the Keystone API server
(CVE-2013-1665). This only affects servers with XML support enabled.

Note:
The vulnerabilities are actually in the various affected Python XML
libraries, but we provide OpenStack patches working around the issues.

Grizzly (development branch) fixes:
Nova: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22309/>
Cinder: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22310/>
Keystone: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22315/>

Folsom fixes:
Nova: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22312/>
Cinder: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22311/>
Keystone: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22314/>

# USN-1757-1: Django vulnerabilities

7 March 2013

Several security issues were fixed in Django.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

James Kettle discovered that Django did not properly filter the Host HTTP

header when processing certain requests. An attacker could exploit this to

generate and display arbitrary URLs to users. Although this issue had been

previously addressed in USN-1632-1, this update adds additional hardening

measures to host header validation. This update also adds a new

ALLOWED\_HOSTS setting that can be set to a list of acceptable values for

headers. ([CVE-2012-4520](/security/CVE-2012-4520))

Orange Tsai discovered that Django incorrectly performed permission checks

when displaying the history view in the admin interface. An administrator

could use this flaw to view the history of any object, regardless of

intended permissions. ([CVE-2013-0305](/security/CVE-2013-0305))

It was discovered that Django incorrectly handled a large number of forms

when generating formsets. An attacker could use this flaw to cause Django

to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-0306](/security/CVE-2013-0306))

It was discovered that Django incorrectly deserialized XML. An attacker

could use this flaw to perform entity-expansion and external-entity/DTD

attacks. This updated modified Django behaviour to no longer allow DTDs,

perform entity expansion, or fetch external entities/DTDs. ([CVE-2013-1664](/security/CVE-2013-1664),

[CVE-2013-1665](/security/CVE-2013-1665))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django)
  -
  [1.4.1-2ubuntu0.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django/1.4.1-2ubuntu0.3)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django)
  -
  [1.3.1-4ubuntu1.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django/1.3.1-4ubuntu1.6)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django)
  -
  [1.3-2ubuntu1.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django/1.3-2ubuntu1.6)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=913808#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-22 06:47:58 UTC  ``` Christian Heimes <christian> reports:  Entity declarations can contain more than just text for replacement.   billion laughs / exponential entity expansion  The Billion Laughs attack -- also known as exponential entity expansion --  uses multiple levels of nested entities. The original example uses 9 levels of  10 expansions in each level to expand the string lol to a string of 3 * 10 9  bytes, hence the name "billion laughs". The resulting string occupies 3 GB  (2.79 GiB) of memory; intermediate strings require additional memory. Because  most parsers don't cache the intermediate step for every expansion it is  repeated over and over again. It increases the CPU load even more.  An XML document of just a few hundred bytes can disrupt all services on a  machine within seconds.  quadratic blowup entity expansion  A quadratic blowup attack is similar to a Billion Laughs attack; it abuses  entity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities it repeats one large entity  with a couple of ten thousand chars over and over again. The attack isn't as  efficient as the exponential case but it avoids triggering countermeasures of  parsers against heavily nested entities. Some parsers limit the depth and  breadth of a single entity but not the total amount of expanded text  throughout an entire XML document.  A medium-sized XML document with a couple of hundred kilobytes can require a  couple of hundred MB to several GB of memory. When the attack is combined with  some level of nested expansion an attacker is able to achieve a higher ratio  of success.

The XML modules are not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data, and such data should not be directly parsed via python's xml modules.  This is clearly documented at: <https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.html> <https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.html#xml-vulnerabilities>  Python upstream suggests the use of "defusedxml" packages, but they break backward compatibility.   Statement:  This issue affects the versions of python as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.   ``` |  |

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0658)

## Topic

Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix two security issues and add one
enhancement are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-cinder packages provide OpenStack Volume (code name Cinder),
which provides services to manage and access block storage volumes for use
by virtual machine instances.

A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
parser used by Cinder. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
specially-crafted request to a Cinder API, causing Cinder to consume an
excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Cinder. If a remote attacker
sent a specially-crafted request to a Cinder API, it could cause Cinder to
connect to external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or
allow an attacker to read files on the Cinder server that are accessible
to the user running Cinder. (CVE-2013-1665)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* This update implements a Cinder driver that allows Red Hat Storage to be

used as a back-end for Cinder volumes. To use this driver,
"volume\_driver = cinder.volume.glusterfs.GlusterfsDriver" and the
"glusterfs\_shares\_config" option must be set in "/etc/cinder/cinder.conf",
and the RHSA-2013:0657 openstack-nova update must also be installed. Note
that there is no volume snapshot or clone support when using this driver.
(BZ#892686)

All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which fix these issues and add this enhancement. After installing
the updated packages, the Cinder running services will be restarted
automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0657)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues, several bugs,
and add an enhancement are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (code name Nova),
which provides services for provisioning, managing, and using virtual
machine instances.

A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
parser used by Nova. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
specially-crafted request to a Nova API, causing Nova to consume an
excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Nova. If a remote attacker
sent a specially-crafted request to a Nova API, it could cause Nova to
connect to external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or
allow an attacker to read files on the Nova server that are accessible to
the user running Nova. (CVE-2013-1665)

This update also fixes several bugs. The following are noteworthy changes:

* In single node, all-in-one environments where all services (such as

Nova, Glance, and Keystone) are installed and run on a single system, after
a host reboot, some instances may have automatically started again, but
soon after, automatically shut down. "Instance shutdown by itself. Calling
the stop API" messages were logged to Nova logs (in "/var/log/nova/") in
these cases. (BZ#890512)

* In environments using Quantum, after creating a network with two

subnets, removing an IP address (using "nova remove-fixed-ip"), and then
adding a fixed address (using "nova add-fixed-ip"), resulted in the
virtual machine having two IP addresses. (BZ#908373)

* Prior to this update, after converting a downloaded image to raw, the

original, downloaded image (a large .part file) was not removed. After
installing this update, the following three options must be configured in
"/etc/nova/nova.conf" to correctly resolve this issue:

remove\_unused\_base\_images=true
remove\_unused\_resized\_minimum\_age\_seconds=60
remove\_unused\_original\_minimum\_age\_seconds=60

(BZ#911103)

Additionally, this update adds the following enhancement:

* The RHSA-2013:0658 openstack-cinder update implemented a Cinder driver

that allows Red Hat Storage to be used as a back-end for Cinder volumes.
This update adds a libvirt connector to Nova, which is a requirement for
using the new Cinder driver. Note that you must manually install the
glusterfs and glusterfs-fuse packages on the Nova nodes.

Additionally, when running Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) in Enforcing
mode, the latest selinux-policy packages provided by RHBA-2013:0618 must be
installed, otherwise denials will be logged when attempting to mount Red
Hat Storage volumes. (BZ#912384)

All users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add this enhancement. After
installing the updated packages, the Nova running services will be
restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Topic

Updated Django packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Django web framework is used by Horizon, the OpenStack Dashboard, which
is a web interface for managing OpenStack services.

A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
parser used by Django. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
specially-crafted request to an Horizon API, causing Horizon to consume an
excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Django. If a remote attacker
sent a specially-crafted request to an Horizon API, it could cause Horizon
to connect to external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or
allow an attacker to read files on the Horizon server that are accessible
to the user running Horizon. (CVE-2013-1665)

It was found that the history view in the bundled administrative web
interface in Django did not perform permission checks. An authenticated
user who can access the web interface could use this flaw to view the
changes to objects and data they would otherwise not have access to.
(CVE-2013-0305)

A flaw was found in the way Django handled formsets. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to submit a large number of forms, causing excessive
memory consumption. Note: The current version of OpenStack in Red Hat
OpenStack Folsom does not expose this vulnerability. (CVE-2013-0306)

This update also includes two hardening fixes to help protect against XML
entity and HTTP Host header poisoning attacks. (BZ#913039, BZ#913037)

All users of Horizon are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which resolve these issues. After installing the updated packages, the
httpd daemon must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for the update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

### Announcing defusedxml, Fixes for XML Security Issues

*The following post was created on behalf of CPython contributor Christian Heimes using a subset of details found [here](https://bitbucket.org/tiran/defusedxml).*

Christian Heimes announces the release of his [defusedxml](https://bitbucket.org/tiran/defusedxml) and [defusedexpat](https://bitbucket.org/tiran/defusedexpat) packages to address XML-related security issues which were reported to security@python.org over the last several months. Throughout the development of the patches, the security team has coordinated with other open source projects in order to make this announcement at 1500 UTC on Tuesday February 19.

Details will follow once releases of CPython have been organized.

***Note: this post will be updated with more details as they switch from being private to publicly available, including links to the public bug reports on [http://bugs.python.org](http://bugs.python.org/).***

defusedxml on PyPI: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedxml>

defusedexpat on PyPI: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedexpat>

"XML vulnerabilities" on bug tracker: <http://bugs.python.org/issue17239>
## [Synopsis](https://bitbucket.org/PSF/defusedxml/#id2)

The results of an attack on a vulnerable XML library can be fairly dramatic. With just a few hundred **Bytes** of XML data an attacker can occupy several **Gigabytes** of memory within **seconds**. An attacker can also keep CPUs busy for a long time with a small to medium size request. Under some circumstances it is even possible to access local files on your server, to circumvent a firewall, or to abuse services to rebound attacks to third parties.
The attacks use and abuse less common features of XML and its parsers. The majority of developers are unacquainted with features such as processing instructions and entity expansions that XML inherited from SGML. At best they know about <!DOCTYPE> from experience with HTML but they are not aware that a document type definition (DTD) can generate an HTTP request or load a file from the file system.
None of the issues is new. They have been known for a long time. Billion laughs was first reported in 2003. Nevertheless some XML libraries and applications are still vulnerable and even heavy users of XML are surprised by these features. It's hard to say whom to blame for the situation. It's too short sighted to shift all blame on XML parsers and XML libraries for using insecure default settings. After all they properly implement XML specifications. Application developers must not rely that a library is always configured for security and potential harmful data by default.
##

## [Attack vectors](https://bitbucket.org/PSF/defusedxml#id3)

### [billion laughs / exponential entity expansion](https://bitbucket.org/PSF/defusedxml#id4)

The [Billion Laughs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs) attack -- also known as exponential entity expansion -- uses multiple levels of nested entities. The original example uses 9 levels of 10 expansions in each level to expand the string lol to a string of 3 \* 10 9 bytes, hence the name "billion laughs". The resulting string occupies 3 GB (2.79 GiB) of memory; intermediate strings require additional memory. Because most parsers don't cache the intermediate step for every expansion it is repeated over and over again. It increases the CPU load even more.
An XML document of just a few hundred bytes can disrupt all services on a machine within seconds.
Example XML:
```
<!DOCTYPE xmlbomb [
<!ENTITY a "1234567890" >
<!ENTITY b "&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;">
<!ENTITY c "&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;">
<!ENTITY d "&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;">
]>
<bomb>&d;</bomb>

```

### [quadratic blowup entity expansion](https://bitbucket.org/PSF/defusedxml#id5)

A quadratic blowup attack is similar to a [Billion Laughs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs) attack; it abuses entity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities it repeats one large entity with a couple of ten thousand chars over and over again. The attack isn't as efficient as the exponential case but it avoids triggering countermeasures of parsers against heavily nested entities. Some parsers limit the depth and breadth of a single entity but not the total amount of expanded text throughout an entire XML document.
A medium-sized XML document with a couple of hundred kilobytes can require a couple of hundred MB to several GB of memory. When the attack is combined with some level of nested expansion an attacker is able to achieve a higher ratio of success.
```
<!DOCTYPE bomb [
<!ENTITY a "xxxxxxx... a couple of ten thousand chars">
]>
<bomb>&a;&a;&a;... repeat</bomb>

```

### [external entity expansion (remote)](https://bitbucket.org/PSF/defusedxml#id6)

Entity declarations can contain more than just text for replacement. They can also point to external resources by public identifiers or system identifiers. System identifiers are standard URIs. When the URI is a URL (e.g. a http:// locator) some parsers download the resource from the remote location and embed them into the XML document verbatim.
Simple example of a parsed external entity:
```
<!DOCTYPE external [
<!ENTITY ee SYSTEM "http://www.python.org/some.xml">
]>
<root>&ee;</root>

```
The case of parsed external entities works only for valid XML content. The XML standard also supports unparsed external entities with a NData declaration.
External entity expansion opens the door to plenty of exploits. An attacker can abuse a vulnerable XML library and application to rebound and forward network requests with the IP address of the server. It highly depends on the parser and the application what kind of exploit is possible. For example:

* An attacker can circumvent firewalls and gain access to restricted resources as all the requests are made from an internal and trustworthy IP address, not from the outside.
* An attacker can abuse a service to attack, spy on or DoS your servers but also third party services. The attack is disguised with the IP address of the server and the attacker is able to utilize the high bandwidth of a big machine.
* An attacker can exhaust additional resources on the machine, e.g. with requests to a service that doesn't respond or responds with very large files.
* An attacker may gain knowledge, when, how often and from which IP address a XML document is accessed.
* An attacker could send mail from inside your network if the URL handler supports smtp:// URIs.

### [external entity expansion (local file)](https://bitbucket.org/PSF/defusedxml#id7)

External entities with references to local files are a sub-case of external entity expansion. It's listed as an extra attack because it deserves extra attention. Some XML libraries such as lxml disable network access by default but still allow entity expansion with local file access by default. Local files are either referenced with a file:// URL or by a file path (either relative or absolute).
An attacker may be able to access and download all files that can be read by the application process. This may include critical configuration files, too.
```
<!DOCTYPE external [
<!ENTITY ee SYSTEM "file:///PATH/TO/simple.xml">
]>
<root>&ee;</root>
```

1. Lxml is protected against billion laughs attacks and doesn't do network lookups by default.
2. libxml2 and lxml are not directly vulnerable to gzip decompression bombs but they don't protect you against them either.
3. xml.etree doesn't expand entities and raises a ParserError when an entity occurs.
4. minidom doesn't expand entities and simply returns the unexpanded entity verbatim.
5. genshi.input of genshi 0.6 doesn't support entity expansion and raises a ParserError when an entity occurs.
6. Library has (limited) XInclude support but requires an additional step to process inclusion.
7. These are features but they may introduce exploitable holes

## [How to avoid XML vulnerabilities](https://bitbucket.org/PSF/defusedxml#id24)

### [Best practices](https://bitbucket.org/PSF/defusedxml#id25)

* Don't allow DTDs
* Don't expand entities
* Don't resolve externals
* Limit parse depth
* Limit total input size
* Limit parse time
* Favor a SAX or iterparse-like parser for potential large data
* Validate and properly quote arguments to XSL transformations and XPath queries
* Don't use XPath expression from untrusted sources
* Don't apply XSL transformations that come untrusted sources

The error when running it manually is just a shell quoting issue AFAICT.  The original error from nova was failing to connect to the database, which is due to nova-dhcpbridge not reading /etc/nova/nova.conf.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=916241#c4)  Russell Bryant    2013-02-27 19:14:59 UTC  ``` Note that my previous comment about what should go in nova-dist.conf was wrong.  It's       dhcpbridge_flagfile=/usr/share/nova/nova-dist.conf      dhcpbridge_flagfile=/etc/nova/nova.conf   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=916241#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-21 18:17:12 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
