  "CVE-2013-1664": {
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) parser used by Cinder, Nova and Keystone. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to a Cinder/Nova/Keystone API, causing Cinder/Nova/Keystone to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory. This vulnerability is due to unrestricted entity expansion in Python XML libraries.",
    "vulnerability": "Unrestricted XML entity expansion",
    "impact": "Denial of service, excessive resource consumption, potentially a crash",
    "attack_vector": "Sending specially crafted XML request to affected API endpoints.",
    "required_capabilities": "Unauthenticated attacker can trigger the DoS. Authenticated attacker can also leverage this for information leak.",
     "details": "The vulnerability arises from the way XML parsers handle entity definitions within a Document Type Definition (DTD). When processing XML requests with specially crafted nested or large entities, the parser expands these entities recursively, leading to excessive memory and CPU usage, causing denial of service. An authenticated attacker may also leverage XML entities to read the content of a local file on the Keystone API server, if XML support is enabled."
