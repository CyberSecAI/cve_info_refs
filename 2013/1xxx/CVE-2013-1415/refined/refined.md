Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1415:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `pkinit_check_kdc_pkid` function within the PKINIT implementation of MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5). Specifically, the function doesn't properly handle errors that occur during the extraction of fields from an X.509 certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is a NULL pointer dereference. When the extraction of certificate fields fails, the code does not properly handle the error, leading to a dereference of a NULL pointer during cleanup.
*   **Error Handling:** Inadequate error handling during X.509 certificate processing. The code does not check for a null return from the `d2i_PKCS7_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL` function before dereferencing it in the `cleanup` block.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit leads to a crash of the Key Distribution Center (KDC) daemon. This effectively disrupts Kerberos services, preventing users from authenticating and accessing network resources relying on it.
*   **KDC Process Crash:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to crash the KDC process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed KRB5_PADATA_PK_AS_REQ:** The attacker sends a crafted AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) packet that includes malformed PKINIT data.
*   **Specifically, an X.509 certificate with missing or invalid data that is processed by the  `d2i_PKCS7_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL` function.**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the KDC.
*   **Valid PKINIT Certificate (or Observed Authentication) or Anonymous PKINIT:** An attacker would need either a valid PKINIT certificate, have observed a successful PKINIT authentication, or the target KDC should allow anonymous PKINIT authentication to trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Understanding of Kerberos/PKINIT:** The attacker would need to have knowledge of the Kerberos protocol and PKINIT extension.
*   **Crafting of Malformed Requests:** Requires the ability to craft malformed KRB5_PADATA_PK_AS_REQ requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) versions before 1.10.4 and 1.11.x before 1.11.1.
*   The fix involves avoiding dereferencing a null pointer during cleanup when processing fails.
*   The fix was introduced in commit `f249555301940c6df3a2cdda13b56b5674eebc2e`.
