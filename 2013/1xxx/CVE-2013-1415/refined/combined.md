How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[list
of fixed bugs](http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/NoAuth/krb5-1.10/fixed-1.10.7.html) tracked in our RT bugtracking system.
## DES transition

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is widely recognized as
weak. The krb5-1.7 release contains measures to encourage sites
to migrate away from using single-DES cryptosystems. Among
these is a configuration variable that enables "weak" enctypes,
which now defaults to "false" beginning with krb5-1.8.
## Major changes in krb5-1.10.7 (2013-11-06)

This is a bugfix release. The krb5-1.10 release series is in
maintenance, and for new deployments, installers should prefer the
krb5-1.11 release series or later.

* Fix a KDC locking issue that could lead to the KDC process
  holding a persistent lock, preventing administrative actions
  such as password changes.* Fix a number of bugs related to KDC master key rollover.* Fix a KDC null pointer dereference [CVE-2013-1418] that
      could affect KDCs that serve multiple realms.

## Major changes in krb5-1.10.6 (2013-06-05)

This is a bugfix release. The krb5-1.10 release series is in
maintenance, and for new deployments, installers should prefer
the krb5-1.11 release series or later.

* Fix a UDP ping-pong vulnerability in the kpasswd (password
  changing) service. [CVE-2002-2443]* Improve interoperability with some Windows native PKINIT
    clients.

## Major changes in krb5-1.10.5 (2013-04-17)

This is a bugfix release. The krb5-1.10 release series is in
maintenance, and for new deployments, installers should prefer the
krb5-1.11 release series or later.

* Fix KDC null pointer dereference in TGS-REQ handling
  [CVE-2013-1416]* Incremental propagation could erroneously act as if a
    slave's database were current after the slave received a full
    dump that failed to load.

## Major changes in 1.10.4 (2013-03-01)

This is a bugfix release.

* Fix null PKINIT pointer dereference vulnerabilities
  [CVE-2012-1016, CVE-2013-1415]* Prevent the KDC from returning a host-based service
    principal referral to the local realm.

## Major changes in 1.10.3 (2012-08-08)

This is a bugfix release.

* Fix KDC uninitialized pointer vulnerabilities that could
  lead to a denial of service [CVE-2012-1014] or remote code
  execution [CVE-2012-1015].* Correctly use default\_tgs\_enctypes instead of
    default\_tkt\_enctypes for TGS requests.

## Major changes in 1.10.2 (2012-05-31)

This is a bugfix release.

* Fix an interop issue with Windows Server 2008 R2 Read-Only Domain
  Controllers.* Update a workaround for a glibc bug that would cause DNS PTR
    queries to occur even when rdns = false.* Fix a kadmind denial of service issue (null pointer
      dereference), which could only be triggered by an
      administrator with the "create" privilege. [CVE-2012-1013]

## Major changes in 1.10.1 (2012-03-08)

This is a bugfix release.

* Fix access controls for KDB string attributes
  [CVE-2012-1012]* Make the ASN.1 encoding of key version numbers interoperate
    with Windows Read-Only Domain Controllers* Avoid generating spurious password expiry warnings in cases
      where the KDC sends an account expiry time without a password
      expiry time.

## Major changes in 1.10 (2012-01-27)

Code quality:

* Fix MITKRB5-SA-2011-006 and MITKRB5-SA-2011-007 KDC
  denial of service vulnerabilities [CVE-2011-1527
  CVE-2011-1528 CVE-2011-1529 CVE-2011-1530].* Update the Fortuna implementation to more accurately
    implement the description in *Cryptography Engineering*,
    and make it the default PRNG.* Add an alternative PRNG that relies on the OS native
      PRNG.

Developer experience:

* Add the ability for GSSAPI servers to use any keytab key
  for a specified service, if the server specifies a
  host-based name with no hostname component.* In the build system, identify the source files needed for
    per-message processing within a kernel and ensure that they remain
    independent.* Allow rd\_safe and rd\_priv to ignore the remote address.* Rework KDC and kadmind networking code to use an event loop
        architecture.* Add a plugin interface for providing configuration information.

Administrator experience:

* Add more complete support for renaming principals.* Add the profile variable ignore\_acceptor\_hostname in libdefaults. If
    set, GSSAPI will ignore the hostname component of acceptor names
    supplied by the server, allowing any keytab key matching the service
    to be used.* Add support for string attributes on principal entries.* Allow password changes to work over NATs.

End-user experience:

* Add the DIR credential cache type, which can hold a collection of
  credential caches.* Enhance kinit, klist, and kdestroy to support credential cache
    collections if the cache type supports it.* Add the kswitch command, which changes the selected default cache
      within a collection.* Add heuristic support for choosing client credentials based on the
        service realm.* Add support for $HOME/.k5identity, which allows credential choice
          based on configured rules.* Add support for localization. (No translations are provided in this
            release, but the infrastructure is present for redistributors to
            supply them.)

Protocol evolution:

* Make PKINIT work with FAST in the client library.

# Kerberos 5 Release 1.11.6

* [Announcement](#announcement)* [README file](README-1.11.6.txt)* [Known Bugs](http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/NoAuth/krb5-1.11/bugs-1.11.6.html)* [Documentation](doc/index.html)* [Retrieving](#fetching)

## Kerberos 5 Release 1.11.6 is now available

The MIT Kerberos Team announces the availability of the
krb5-1.11.6 release. The [detached PGP
signature](krb5-1.11.6.sig) is available without going through the download
page, if you wish to verify the authenticity of a distribution
you have obtained elsewhere.

Please see the [README file](README-1.11.6.txt) for a
more complete list of changes.

You may also see the current full
[list
of fixed bugs](http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/NoAuth/krb5-1.11/fixed-1.11.6.html) tracked in our RT bugtracking system.
## DES transition

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is widely recognized as
weak. The krb5-1.7 release contains measures to encourage sites
to migrate away from using single-DES cryptosystems. Among
these is a configuration variable that enables "weak" enctypes,
which now defaults to "false" beginning with krb5-1.8.
## Major changes in 1.11.6 (2015-02-24)

This is a bugfix release. The krb5-1.11 release series has
reached the end of its maintenance period, and krb5-1.11.6 is
the last planned release in the krb5-1.11 series. For new
deployments, installers should prefer the krb5-1.13 release
series or later.

* Work around a gcc optimizer bug that could cause DB2 KDC
  database operations to spin in an infinite loop* Fix a backward compatibility problem with the LDAP KDB
    schema that could prevent krb5-1.11 and later from decoding
    entries created by krb5-1.6.* Handle certain invalid RFC 1964 GSS tokens correctly to
      avoid invalid memory reference vulnerabilities.
      [CVE-2014-4341 CVE-2014-4342]* Fix memory management vulnerabilities in GSSAPI SPNEGO.
        [CVE-2014-4343 CVE-2014-4344]* Fix buffer overflow vulnerability in LDAP KDB back end.
          [CVE-2014-4345]* Fix multiple vulnerabilities in the LDAP KDC back end.
            [CVE-2014-5354 CVE-2014-5353]* Fix multiple kadmind vulnerabilities, some of which are
              based in the gssrpc library. [CVE-2014-5352 CVE-2014-9421
              CVE-2014-9422 CVE-2014-9423]

## Major changes in 1.11.5 (2014-01-21)

* Make KDC log service principal names more consistently during some
  error conditions, instead of "<unknown server>"* Fix some GSSAPI bugs.* Improve documentation.

## Major changes in 1.11.4 (2013-11-04)

* Fix a KDC null pointer dereference [CVE-2013-1417] that
  could affect realms with an uncommon configuration.* Fix a KDC null pointer dereference [CVE-2013-1418] that
    could affect KDCs that serve multiple realms.* Fix a number of bugs related to KDC master key rollover.

## Major changes in 1.11.3 (2013-06-03)

* Fix a UDP ping-pong vulnerability in the kpasswd (password
  changing) service. [CVE-2002-2443]* Improve interoperability with some Windows native PKINIT
    clients.

## Major changes in 1.11.2 (2013-04-11)

* Incremental propagation could erroneously act as if a
  slave's database were current after the slave received a full
  dump that failed to load.* gss\_import\_sec\_context incorrectly set internal state that
    identifies whether an imported context is from an interposer
    mechanism or from the underlying mechanism.

## Major changes in 1.11.1 (2013-02-21)

* Restore capability for multi-hop SAM-2 preauth exchanges,
  which krb5-1.11 had inadvertently removed.* Fix a null pointer dereference in the KDC PKINIT code
    [CVE-2013-1415].

## Major changes in 1.11 (2012-12-17)

Code quality:

* Improve ASN.1 support code, making it table-driven for
  decoding as well as encoding* Refactor parts of KDC

Developer experience:

* Documentation consolidation* Add a new API krb5\_kt\_have\_content() to determine whether a keytab
    exists and contains any entries.* Add a new API krb5\_cccol\_have\_content() to determine whether the
      ccache collection contains any credentials.* Add a new API krb5\_kt\_client\_default() to resolve the default client
        keytab.* Add new APIs gss\_export\_cred and gss\_import\_cred to serialize and
          unserialize GSSAPI credentials.* Add a krb5\_get\_init\_creds\_opt\_set\_in\_ccache() option.* Add get\_cc\_config() and set\_cc\_config() clpreauth callbacks for
              getting string attribute values from an in\_ccache and storing them
              in an out\_ccache, respectively.* Add a plugin interface for GSSAPI interposer mechanisms.* Add an optional responder callback to the krb5\_get\_init\_creds
                  functions. The responder callback can consider and answer all
                  preauth-related questions at once, and can process more complicated
                  questions than the prompter.* Add a method to the clpreauth interface to allow modules to supply
                    response items for consideration by the responder callback.* Projects/Password\_response\_item* Add GSSAPI extensions to allow callers to specify credential store
                        locations when acquiring or storing credentials* Add a new API krb5\_kt\_client\_default() to resolve the default client
                          keytab.

Administrator experience:

* Documentation consolidation* Add parameter expansion for default\_keytab\_name and
    default\_client\_keytab\_name profile variables.* Add new default\_ccache\_name profile variable to override the
      built-in default credential cache name.* Add configure-time support for changing the built-in ccache and
        keytab names.* Add krb5-config options for displaying the built-in ccache and
          keytab names.* In the default build, use the system's built-in ccache and keytab
            names if they can be discovered using krb5-config.* Add support for a "default client keytab". Its location is
              determined by the KRB5\_CLIENT\_KTNAME environment variable, the
              default\_client\_keytab profile relation, or a hardcoded path (TBD).* GSSAPI initiator applications can now acquire credentials
                automatically from the default client keytab, if one is available.* Add client support for FAST OTP (RFC 6560)

End-user experience:

* Documentation consolidation* Store metadata in the ccache about how a credential was acquired, to
    improve the user's experience when reacquiring* Projects/Extensible\_Policy

Performance:

* Improve KDC lookaside cache performance

Protocol evolution:

* Add client support for FAST OTP (RFC 6560)* Build Camellia encryption support by default

## Description

The pkinit\_check\_kdc\_pkid function in plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit\_crypto\_openssl.c in the PKINIT implementation in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.10.4 and 1.11.x before 1.11.1 does not properly handle errors during extraction of fields from an X.509 certificate, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a malformed KRB5\_PADATA\_PK\_AS\_REQ AS-REQ request.

PKINIT null pointer deref [[CVE-2013-1415](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gvc4-pvfx-8p8m "CVE-2013-1415")]

Don't dereference a null pointer when cleaning up.

The KDC plugin for PKINIT can dereference a null pointer when a
malformed packet causes processing to terminate early, leading to
a crash of the KDC process.  An attacker would need to have a valid
PKINIT certificate or have observed a successful PKINIT authentication,
or an unauthenticated attacker could execute the attack if anonymous
PKINIT is enabled.
