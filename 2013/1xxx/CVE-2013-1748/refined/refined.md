Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2013-1748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the Simple PHP Address Book application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, password hashes (md5), and email addresses.
- The attacker can potentially modify or delete data in the database.
- By using SQL injection, an attacker can bypass normal access controls to the database, and could escalate privileges if the database user has elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via the following pages/parameters:
   - `/view.php?id=` : The `id` parameter is vulnerable, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code directly into the query.
   - `/edit.php` : Several fields on this page are vulnerable to SQL injection.
   - `/import.php` : The import function is also vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically via CSV import.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to have a general understanding of SQL and SQL injection techniques.
- No authentication is needed to exploit the `view.php` vulnerability. The `edit.php` and `import.php` vulnerabilities are available to authenticated users.

**Detailed Vulnerability Information:**
-   **/view.php?id=** : The `id` parameter is vulnerable. The injection vector `/view.php?id=-1' union select '1','2','3','4',(select username from users limit 1),(select md5_pass from users limit 1),(select email from users limit 1),'8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15','16','17','18','19','20','21','22','23','24','25','26','27','28','29','30','31','32','33','34','35','36','37','38','39','40','41` demonstrates how to extract the username, md5 password and email of the first user from the database.

-   **/edit.php** and **/import.php**:  These pages have multiple input fields susceptible to SQL injection. The provided injection vector `'+(select ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT md5_pass from users limit 1), 1)))+'` can be used to extract the ASCII value of the first character of the first user's password hash, which can be used to enumerate the password. The `/import.php` page can be attacked by injecting SQL in a CSV file and importing it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the vendor was unresponsive.
- The original vulnerability report also includes a separate vulnerability, CVE-2013-1749 (Cross-Site Scripting).
- A comment suggests that CVE-2013-1748 might be a duplicate of CVE-2008-2565, indicating the vulnerability might be a long-standing issue in the project.
