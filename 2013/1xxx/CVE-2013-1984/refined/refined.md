{
  "CVE-2013-1984": {
    "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in libXi could lead to memory corruption. The functions affected are: XGetDeviceControl(), XGetFeedbackControl(), XGetDeviceDontPropagateList(), XGetDeviceMotionEvents(), XIGetProperty(), XIGetSelectedEvents(), XGetDeviceProperties(), and XListInputDevices().",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflows when calculating memory allocation sizes based on data received from the X server, leading to insufficient buffer allocation and subsequent memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Insufficient buffer allocation",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could cause applications to crash, leading to a denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code by triggering these overflows.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending crafted responses from the X server that include large values for items, events, or axes, an attacker can cause the client library to allocate insufficient memory.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the X server to send specially crafted responses to a vulnerable client application. This could be a local user who has access to a virtual X server or an attacker who has compromised an X server and is able to send malformed data to a client."
