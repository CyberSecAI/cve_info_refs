Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1575:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an infinite or large loop within the R3 dissector of Wireshark. This occurs when processing a malformed or crafted R3 packet, leading to excessive CPU consumption. This is part of a larger issue, `wnpa-sec-2013-01`, that affects multiple dissectors with similar looping issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite/Large Loop:** The vulnerability stems from the dissector not properly handling certain malformed packet structures, causing an infinite or very large loop within the dissector code. This results in the program becoming unresponsive due to excessive CPU usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition. By sending a specially crafted R3 packet (or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file), an attacker can cause Wireshark to enter an infinite loop. This consumes excessive CPU resources, rendering Wireshark unresponsive and effectively preventing it from being used.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject malformed R3 packets onto the network. If a vulnerable Wireshark instance is capturing traffic on that network, it will try to dissect these packets and enter the infinite loop.
*   **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker can send a capture file containing malformed R3 packets to a user, and upon opening it with vulnerable Wireshark, the same issue occurs.
*  **Packet inspection:** If a user is examining malicious packets with Wireshark, this can also trigger the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Malformed Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to send malformed R3 packets to a network that is being monitored by Wireshark. This could be accomplished if the attacker is on the same network segment or has the ability to inject network traffic.
*   **Ability to Distribute Malicious Capture Files:** Alternatively, the attacker could simply send a malicious capture file to a user who uses Wireshark to examine the file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This CVE is part of a larger group of vulnerabilities (wnpa-sec-2013-01) affecting various dissectors.
*   The vulnerability is resolved in Wireshark versions 1.8.5 and 1.6.13.
