Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2013-1290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way SharePoint Server enforces access controls on specific SharePoint Lists. By default, SharePoint applies incorrect access controls to these lists, leading to potential information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Rights:** SharePoint Server fails to properly restrict access to SharePoint lists, allowing unauthorized users to potentially view list items. This is due to an issue with the default access control settings applied to these lists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain access to documents and list items they should not have access to. This unauthorized access could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack requires the attacker to know the address or location of a specific SharePoint list.
*   The attacker must also authenticate to the SharePoint site where the list is maintained.
*   Exploitation is more likely to occur on "My Sites" created using the legacy user interface mode in SharePoint Server 2013 installations upgraded from SharePoint Server 2010. New My Sites from clean installs are not vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid Active Directory credentials to be authenticated as a SharePoint user.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker must know the specific address/location of a vulnerable SharePoint list.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need to be able to access the SharePoint site.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Mitigation:** Although not a fix, setting the permissions for usersâ€™ personal document libraries to explicitly deny access to "NT Authenticated\All users" and stopping the inheritance of permissions can mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Workaround:** Setting the permissions for users' personal document libraries to explicitly deny access to "NT Authenticated\All users" and set the permissions on each personal library to "Stop Inheriting Permissions" is a workaround but not a fix.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released.
*   Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability when the security bulletin was released.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by correcting the default access controls applied to SharePoint lists.
* The security update 2737969 requires prior installation of the Project Server 2013 cumulative update (2768001).
