Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1920:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Xen manages event channel tracking tables when the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled and the hypervisor is under memory pressure. Specifically, it's due to an incorrect order of operations when extending the per-domain event channel tracking table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The incorrect ordering of operations can leave a pointer to freed memory in the event channel tracking table.
- **Memory Corruption:** This use-after-free condition can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Event Injection:** A malicious guest kernel could inject arbitrary events into the hypervisor.
- **Hypervisor State Corruption:**  The freed memory could be reallocated for different use. Subsequent operations on this now-corrupted pointer will likely lead to the hypervisor state corruption.
- **Code Execution:** It is possible that the above impacts could lead to code execution on the hypervisor.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious guest kernel could escalate its privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious guest kernel.
- The hypervisor must be under memory pressure
- Xen Security Module (XSM) must be enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have control of a guest kernel.
- The guest must be running in a vulnerable Xen environment.
- The attacker does not need to be a privileged user inside the guest OS.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects Xen versions 3.2 and later when XSM is enabled.
- Configurations without XSM or with a dummy module are not affected.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "moderate" or "important" rating by different vendors.
- Patches were released to fix this issue.
- The openwall mailing list message also mentions that this vulnerability is related to XSA-47.
