…l_console_drivers

This patch corrects a buffer overflow in kernels from 3.0 to 3.4 when calling
log_prefix() function from call_console_drivers().

This bug existed in previous releases but has been revealed with commit
[162a7e7](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/162a7e7500f9664636e649ba59defe541b7c2c60) (2.6.39 => 3.0) that made changes
about how to allocate memory for early printk buffer (use of memblock_alloc).
It disappears with commit [7ff9554](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7ff9554bb578ba02166071d2d487b7fc7d860d62) (3.4 => 3.5)
that does a refactoring of printk buffer management.

In log_prefix(), the access to "p[0]", "p[1]", "p[2]" or
"simple_strtoul(&p[1], &endp, 10)" may cause a buffer overflow as this
function is called from call_console_drivers by passing "&LOG_BUF(cur_index)"
where the index must be masked to do not exceed the buffer's boundary.

The trick is to prepare in call_console_drivers() a buffer with the necessary
data (PRI field of syslog message) to be safely evaluated in log_prefix().

This patch can be applied to stable kernel branches 3.0.y, 3.2.y and 3.4.y.

Without this patch, one can freeze a server running this loop from shell :
  $ export DUMMY=`cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '12345AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWXCVBNazertyuiopqsdfghjklmwxcvbn' | head -c255`
  $ while true do ; echo $DUMMY > /dev/kmsg ; done

The "server freeze" depends on where memblock_alloc does allocate printk buffer :
if the buffer overflow is inside another kernel allocation the problem may not
be revealed, else the server may hangs up.

that does a refactoring of printk buffer management.
In log\_prefix(), the access to "p[0]", "p[1]", "p[2]" or
"simple\_strtoul(&p[1], &endp, 10)" may cause a buffer overflow as this
function is called from call\_console\_drivers by passing "&LOG\_BUF(cur\_index)"
where the index must be masked to do not exceed the buffer's boundary.
The trick is to prepare in call\_console\_drivers() a buffer with the necessary
data (PRI field of syslog message) to be safely evaluated in log\_prefix().
This patch can be applied to stable kernel branches 3.0.y, 3.2.y and 3.4.y.
Without this patch, one can freeze a server running this loop from shell :
$ export DUMMY=`cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '12345AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWXCVBNazertyuiopqsdfghjklmwxcvbn' | head -c255`
$ while true do ; echo $DUMMY > /dev/kmsg ; done
The "server freeze" depends on where memblock\_alloc does allocate printk buffer :
if the buffer overflow is inside another kernel allocation the problem may not
be revealed, else the server may hangs up.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-02-22 19:46:08 UTC  ``` From $URL :  Description A vulnerability has been reported in Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users  to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).  The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the "call_console_drivers()" function  (kernel/printk.c) when stripping log prefixes. This can be exploited to cause the system to stop  responding via specially crafted shell commands.  The vulnerability is reported in versions prior to 3.0.66, 3.2.38, and 3.4.33.   Solution Update to version 3.0.66, 3.2.38, or 3.4.33.  Provided and/or discovered by Alexandre Simon  Original Advisory Kernel.org: <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/ChangeLog-3.0.66> <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/ChangeLog-3.2.38> <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/ChangeLog-3.4.33> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-04-04 18:34:23 UTC  ``` There are no longer any 2.x or <3.4 kernels available in the repository with the exception of sys-kernel/xbox-sources which is unsupported by security. ``` |  |

An update that solves 13 vulnerabilities and has 35 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The kernel was updated to Linux kernel 3.0.80, fixing
various bugs and security issues.
Following security issues were fixed: CVE-2013-0160:
Timing side channel on attacks were possible on /dev/ptmx
that could allow local attackers to predict keypresses like
e.g. passwords. This has been fixed again by updating
accessed/modified time on the pty devices in resolution of
8 seconds, so that idle time detection can still work.
CVE-2013-3222: The vcc\_recvmsg function in
net/atm/common.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain length variable, which allowed local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3223: The ax25\_recvmsg function in
net/ax25/af\_ax25.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain data structure, which allowed local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3224: The bt\_sock\_recvmsg function in
net/bluetooth/af\_bluetooth.c in the Linux kernel did not
properly initialize a certain length variable, which
allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel stack memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom
system call.
CVE-2013-3225: The rfcomm\_sock\_recvmsg function in
net/bluetooth/rfcomm/sock.c in the Linux kernel did not
initialize a certain length variable, which allowed local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3227: The caif\_seqpkt\_recvmsg function in
net/caif/caif\_socket.c in the Linux kernel did not
initialize a certain length variable, which allowed local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3228: The irda\_recvmsg\_dgram function in
net/irda/af\_irda.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain length variable, which allowed local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3229: The iucv\_sock\_recvmsg function in
net/iucv/af\_iucv.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain length variable, which allowed local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3231: The llc\_ui\_recvmsg function in
net/llc/af\_llc.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain length variable, which allowed local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3232: The nr\_recvmsg function in
net/netrom/af\_netrom.c in the Linux kernel did not
initialize a certain data structure, which allowed local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3234: The rose\_recvmsg function in
net/rose/af\_rose.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain data structure, which allowed local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3235: net/tipc/socket.c in the Linux kernel did
not initialize a certain data structure and a certain
length variable, which allowed local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3076: The crypto API in the Linux kernel did
not initialize certain length variables, which allowed
local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call,
related to the hash\_recvmsg function in crypto/algif\_hash.c
and the skcipher\_recvmsg function in
crypto/algif\_skcipher.c.
CVE-2013-1979: The scm\_set\_cred function in
include/net/scm.h in the Linux kernel used incorrect uid
and gid values during credentials passing, which allowed
local users to gain privileges via a crafted application.
A kernel information leak via tkill/tgkill was fixed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=916075#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-02-27 08:40:38 UTC  ``` Description of the problem: A buffer overrun flaw was found in kernels from 3.0 to 3.4 when calling log_prefix() function from call_console_drivers().      In log_prefix(), the access to "p[1]", "p[2]" or "simple_strtoul(&p[1], &endp, 10)" may cause a buffer overflow as this function is called from call_console_drivers by passing "&LOG_BUF(cur_index)" where the index must be masked to do not exceed the buffer's boundary.  A local user able to write to /dev/kmsg could use this flaw to crash the system.  Note: /dev/kmsg is root writable only (at least on RHEL/Fedora), but it still might cause issues in restricted root environments.  References: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/458780> <https://secunia.com/advisories/52366/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=916075#c1)  Petr Matousek    2013-02-27 08:44:43 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=916075#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-06 19:26:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2013:0566 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0566.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
