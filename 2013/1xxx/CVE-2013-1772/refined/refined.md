Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1772:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `log_prefix()` function within the Linux kernel's printk functionality. This function is called from `call_console_drivers()`.
*   The issue arises because `log_prefix()` accesses parts of the kernel log buffer (specifically `p[0]`, `p[1]`, `p[2]`, or `simple_strtoul(&p[1], &endp, 10)`) without proper bounds checking.
*   The `call_console_drivers()` function passes `&LOG_BUF(cur_index)` to `log_prefix()`, where `cur_index` is an index into the kernel's log buffer. If `cur_index` is not properly masked to stay within the buffer boundaries, `log_prefix()` can read out of bounds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a classic buffer overflow, where a function attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory. This can lead to reading sensitive kernel memory, or cause a crash.
*   **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The `log_prefix()` function does not validate that the provided pointer `p` is within the bounds of the allocated kernel log buffer before accessing `p[0]`, `p[1]`, `p[2]`, or calling `simple_strtoul(&p[1], &endp, 10)`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. An attacker can trigger the overflow, leading to a system freeze or crash (kernel panic).
*   **Potential Information Leak:** In some scenarios, the buffer overflow may allow reading kernel memory, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*   **System Instability:** The memory corruption caused by the overflow can lead to unpredictable system behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local User:** The attack vector is a local user who has the ability to write to the `/dev/kmsg` device.
*   **Crafted Shell Commands:** The vulnerability is triggered by writing specially crafted data to `/dev/kmsg`. An example is provided:
    ```bash
    export DUMMY=`cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '12345AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWXCVBNazertyuiopqsdfghjklmwxcvbn' | head -c255`
    while true do ; echo $DUMMY > /dev/kmsg ; done
    ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Write Access to `/dev/kmsg`:** The attacker must have write privileges to the `/dev/kmsg` device. This is typically limited to the root user, but it could be exploited in restricted root environments.
*   **Ability to Execute Commands:** The attacker must be able to execute shell commands on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Linux kernels from 3.0 to 3.4.
*   The bug was introduced with commit `162a7e7500f9664636e649ba59defe541b7c2c60` (2.6.39 => 3.0).
*   It was fixed with commit `7ff9554bb578ba02166071d2d487b7fc7d860d62` (3.4 => 3.5).
*   The provided patch corrects the issue by preparing a buffer with the necessary syslog priority (PRI) data before passing it to `log_prefix()`. This prevents out-of-bounds access by masking the `cur_index` in `call_console_drivers`.
*   The likelihood of a "server freeze" depends on where the memory is allocated by `memblock_alloc`; if the overflow occurs in unused memory, the issue may not be revealed.
