Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2013-1796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow within the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel.
*   Specifically, the `kvm_set_msr_common` function in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.c` fails to properly validate the alignment of the `time_page` address when handling the `MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME` operation.
*   The guest OS is able to set the Guest Physical Address (GPA) of the time_page, and if this address is not 32-byte aligned then KVM will write to an incorrect page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow. KVM uses `memcpy` to write data to a memory page with an offset controlled by the guest OS. This offset was not correctly validated, enabling writes to arbitrary pages.
*   **Missing Input Validation:** The lack of proper input validation on the `time_page` alignment allows a malicious guest to control the memory region being written to by the hypervisor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Host Kernel Memory Corruption:** A malicious guest OS could leverage this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary memory in the host kernel.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** This memory corruption can lead to a crash of the host operating system.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** By corrupting host kernel memory, a malicious guest could potentially escalate privileges on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest OS Control:** The attacker requires control of a guest operating system running under KVM.
*   **MSR Access:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the `MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME` machine state register within the guest OS.
*   **Crafted GPA:** A malicious guest OS would need to specify an incorrect, non-32-byte aligned GPA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Guest User:** The attacker needs to have a privileged user account within the guest OS. This is typically root or an account with similar capabilities.
*   **KVM Environment:** The attacker must be executing within a virtualized environment using KVM.
*   **Malicious Intent:** The attacker must be actively trying to exploit the vulnerability, since legitimate guests will not trigger this.

**Additional details from the content (Beyond the CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel through version 3.8.4.
*   The issue was discovered and reported by Andrew Honig of Google.
*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure the address is 32-byte aligned.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 was not affected because it did not provide support for the KVM subsystem.
*   Multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux and related products were affected, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, MRG, and RHEV-H. Patches were made available in errata updates such as RHSA-2013:0744, RHSA-2013:0746, RHSA-2013:0727, RHSA-2013:0928, RHSA-2013:1026.
*   openSUSE 11.4 and 12.1 were affected and fixed via security updates.
*   Ubuntu was affected and fixed via USNs USN-1805-1, USN-1808-1, USN-1809-1, USN-1812-1 and USN-1813-1
*   Upstream fix is available at [https://git.kernel.org/cgit/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?id=c300aa64ddf57d9c5d9c898a64b36877345dd4a9](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?id=c300aa64ddf57d9c5d9c898a64b36877345dd4a9).
