Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Novell ZENworks Control Center (ZCC) web application.
*   Insufficient authentication checks on the `/zenworks/jsp/index.jsp` page allow unauthenticated remote attackers to upload files to the webserver.
*   This is coupled with a directory traversal vulnerability, allowing an attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations within the server's file system, outside of the intended temporary directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication:** The file upload functionality lacks proper authentication, meaning anyone with network access to the ZCC interface can attempt to upload files.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The web application does not properly sanitize the file path provided during upload allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences such as `../` to write files outside the intended directory.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not restrict the type of file that can be uploaded, allowing the upload of malicious executable files (e.g., WAR files containing JSP payloads).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious WAR file and then triggering it through a crafted request, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This allows them to run commands with the privileges of the user running the ZCC server which is typically SYSTEM.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a full system compromise with complete control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible to remote attackers with network connectivity to the ZCC interface, which typically listens on TCP port 443 (HTTPS).
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is carried out through a series of HTTP requests. First, a file is uploaded with a path traversal sequence in the filename. Second, a request is sent to trigger the uploaded malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target server running ZCC. No prior authentication is required.
*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to perform file uploads and to trigger the execution of the uploaded payload.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Novell ZENworks Configuration Management versions 10 SP3 and 11 SP2 and was fixed in ZCM 11.2.4 and ZCM 11.3.
*   The ZDI advisory assigned the identifier ZDI-13-049 to this vulnerability.
*   A Metasploit module was developed to automate the exploitation of this vulnerability.
