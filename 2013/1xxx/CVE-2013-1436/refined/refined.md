Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1436:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `XMonad.Hooks.DynamicLog` module within xmonad-contrib. This module feeds information, including window titles, to external programs like status bars (e.g., xmobar, dzen2). These status bars use a meta-language to format input, allowing for actions upon clicks. The `DynamicLog` module does not properly sanitize the window title, which allows an attacker to inject commands into the title.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands via a crafted window title. The status bar interprets specific tags, like `<action=command>`, within the title, which could be supplied by a malicious website, and executes the injected command when the user clicks the title displayed in the bar.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `DynamicLog` module doesn't sanitize or validate the input (window title), leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the xmonad process. This means the attacker could gain control over the user's session.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary impact, a DoS condition might be triggered if the injected command crashes the system or consumes excessive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious website that sets a specially crafted title for its browser tab or window. This title contains the injected command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through a malicious website.
- **Website Creation:** The attacker needs to control a website or be able to inject malicious content to set the title of a web page
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction, specifically a click on the title bar of the status bar which is displaying the injected content.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of `xmonad-contrib` prior to 0.11.2.
- A patch was developed by Adam Vogt and is available in the xmonad darcs repository.
- The vulnerability was disclosed by Raul Benencia.
- The fix involves sanitizing or validating the window title input in the `DynamicLog` module.
- Affected programs include status bars such as xmobar and dzen2
