      "details": "The provided documents mention CVE-2013-1288 as one of several vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-021. \n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer handles the `CTreeNode` object. This occurs when the browser attempts to access a `CTreeNode` object in memory that has already been deleted, possibly corrupting memory and allowing arbitrary code execution.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free vulnerability related to the `CTreeNode` object in Internet Explorer.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the current user has administrative privileges, an attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.\n\nAttack vectors: An attacker could host a specially crafted website that, when viewed through Internet Explorer, would exploit this vulnerability. Attackers may also use compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content to deliver the malicious exploit. The attacker would need to convince the user to visit the malicious website, typically through a link in an email or instant message, or by opening a malicious attachment.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a trusted website. The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the website using Internet Explorer. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability."
