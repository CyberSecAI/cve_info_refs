Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way Network Security Services (NSS) handles padding in TLS/SSL and DTLS protocols when using CBC-mode cipher suites. Specifically, NSS does not adhere to the RFC recommendations regarding MAC checks when dealing with bad padding, instead using the last byte of plaintext to determine the padding length. This timing differences in processing lead to a padding oracle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **TLS CBC Padding Timing Flaw:** NSS is vulnerable to a timing side-channel attack when decrypting TLS/SSL and DTLS records using CBC-mode cipher suites. The vulnerability lies in how NSS processes padding when the padding is malformed.
*   **Improper MAC Check:** Instead of assuming zero-length padding as recommended, NSS uses the last byte of the plaintext to determine how many bytes to remove (even if the bytes are not correctly formatted).
*   **Padding Oracle:** A remote attacker can exploit the timing differences in processing padding to perform plaintext-recovery attacks, effectively using the TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a padding oracle.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can potentially retrieve plaintext from encrypted TLS/SSL or DTLS packets by exploiting the timing differences.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** A successful attack allows a man-in-the-middle to decrypt the traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network connection to a server using TLS/SSL or DTLS.
*   **Timing Analysis:** The attack relies on timing differences in how the server processes the packets to expose the plaintext.
*   **Padding Manipulation:** The attacker sends specially crafted packets with modified padding to trigger timing differences and infer the underlying plaintext.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept or inject network traffic between a client and the vulnerable server.
*   **Timing Precision:** The attacker needs the capability to measure the timing differences in the server's response to different requests.
*   **Multiple Requests:** When TLS is used, a large number of TLS sessions are required (target plaintext must be sent repeatedly). When DTLS is used, a successful attack can be carried out in a single session.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple implementations, including GnuTLS and NSS, deviated from RFC recommendations leading to the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability impacts various products using NSS, as seen in the update lists provided by openSUSE, Red Hat, and VMWare.
*   Fixes involve updating NSS and associated libraries.

**CVE Description (from analyzed content):**

>   It was discovered that NSS leaked timing information when decrypting TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a padding oracle.
