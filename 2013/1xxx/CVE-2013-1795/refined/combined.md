How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

OpenAFS Security Advisory 2013-0002
Topic: Buffer overflow in OpenAFS ptserver
CVE-2013-1795
Issued: 21 Feb 2013
Last Updated: 21 Feb 2013
Affected: OpenAFS servers before version 1.6.2
An attacker can crash an OpenAFS ptserver by sending an IdToName RPC with
a large payload.
SUMMARY
=======
The ptserver accepts a list of unbounded size from the IdToName RPC. The
length of this list is then used to determine the size of a number of other
internal datastructures. If the length is sufficiently large then we may
hit an integer overflow when calculating the size to pass to malloc, and
allocate data structures of insufficient length, allowing heap memory to
be overwritten.
IMPACT
======
An unauthenticated attacker can crash an OpenAFS ptserver
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
All releases of OpenAFS prior to 1.6.2
FIXES
=====
The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade to OpenAFS
1.6.2 or later.
For those sites unable, or unwilling, to upgrade a patch which resolves
this issue is included below. This patch should apply to both OpenAFS
1.6.1 and OpenAFS 1.4.14
The latest stable OpenAFS release is always available from
http://www.openafs.org/release/latest.html
This announcement, and code patches related to it, may be found on the
OpenAFS security advisory page at
http://www.openafs.org/security/
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================
This issue was identified, and the fix provided, by Nickolai Zeldovich
