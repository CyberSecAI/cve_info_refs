Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1795:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `www.debian.org`, `www.openafs.org` and `secunia.com` all explicitly mention CVE-2013-1795 and describe a buffer overflow vulnerability in OpenAFS related to the `ptserver`. Therefore, the content is relevant to this CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is an integer overflow when calculating the size of memory to allocate for internal data structures within the OpenAFS `ptserver`. This happens when processing the list of IDs sent in an `IdToName` RPC call. The length of this list, if excessively large, leads to an integer overflow during the size calculation for memory allocation (malloc), resulting in undersized buffer allocation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. Since the allocated memory is too small, subsequent data copied into the undersized buffer overwrites adjacent heap memory.
    *   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability is triggered by an integer overflow in the memory allocation size calculation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unauthenticated attacker can crash the `ptserver` by sending a malicious `IdToName` RPC request.
    *   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The buffer overflow vulnerability, in theory, could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted by an attacker. This is not explicitly stated in the advisory, but is implied by the nature of memory corruption vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted `IdToName` RPC request over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable OpenAFS server.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all OpenAFS servers prior to version 1.6.2.
*   Patches are available for versions 1.6.1 and 1.4.14.
*   The vulnerability was identified and the fix provided by Nickolai Zeldovich.
