{
  "CVE-2013-1768": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The BrokerFactory functionality in Apache OpenJPA creates local executable JSP files containing logging trace data produced during deserialization of certain crafted OpenJPA objects.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure deserialization of a crafted OpenJPA object leading to arbitrary file creation.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code by creating a serialized object, causing the server to create an executable file, and then leveraging another improperly secured server program to execute the file and gain access to the system.",
       "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker able to supply a serialized instance of the BrokerFactory class, which will be deserialized on a server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to discover an unprotected server program to deliver the malicious serialized object and then discover another unprotected server program to execute the generated malicious file."
    },

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The logging during deserialization of the BrokerFactory class in Apache OpenJPA.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsafe deserialization leading to local file creation of JSP files.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker able to supply a serialized instance of the BrokerFactory class could use this flaw to write an executable file to the server's file system, leading to potential remote code execution.",
       "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted serialized object to the vulnerable server application.",
