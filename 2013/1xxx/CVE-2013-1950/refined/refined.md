```
{
  "Root cause": "A flaw was found in the way libtirpc decoded RPC requests. A specially crafted RPC request could cause libtirpc to attempt to free a buffer provided by an application using the library, even when the buffer was not dynamically allocated.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Invalid pointer free"
  ],
  "Impact": "The vulnerability could cause an application using libtirpc, such as rpcbind, to crash.",
  "Attack vector": "A remote attacker could send a specially crafted Sun RPC request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service, such as rpcbind."
