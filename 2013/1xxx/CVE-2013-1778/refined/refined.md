Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-1778

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The provided content indicates that the "Creative Theme" for Drupal is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The exact mechanism or specific vulnerable code within the theme is not detailed in this content. However, it is highly likely that user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding within the "Creative Theme."

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
* Inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users of the affected Drupal site.
* Steal user session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
* Redirect users to malicious websites.
* Perform actions on behalf of the user.
* Deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious code within a vulnerable part of the theme. This would typically involve supplying a crafted input that is not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* An attacker would need the ability to provide input to the vulnerable part of the theme.
* The attacker would not necessarily need any specific authentication to exploit the XSS, but that depends on the specific vulnerable context in the theme.
* The attacker needs knowledge about the theme's vulnerability, which may be disclosed publicly.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content also mentions multiple other Drupal themes affected by similar XSS vulnerabilities, indicating a systemic problem with how these themes handle user input.
*   The Drupal Security Advisory (SA-CONTRIB-2013-024) is specifically for this vulnerability, and the provided link (http://drupal.org/node/1929474) could have further details.
