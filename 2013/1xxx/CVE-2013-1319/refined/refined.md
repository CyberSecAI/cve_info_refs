Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-1319:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability arises because Microsoft Publisher ignores a returned method value while parsing specially crafted Publisher files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper return value handling: The application does not properly check or handle the return value of a method, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- Full System Control: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install software, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.
- Privilege Escalation: Although not explicitly stated, the potential for privilege escalation is implied because the attacker gains the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specially crafted Publisher files: The primary attack vector is through opening a malicious Publisher file.
- Email: An attacker could send a malicious file as an email attachment, attempting to trick the user into opening it.
- Web-based attacks: Attackers could host malicious Publisher files on compromised websites or via ads. Users are lured to these sites and then convinced to open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create/modify Publisher files: The attacker needs to be able to generate or modify Publisher files to embed the malicious content.
- Social Engineering: Attackers need to rely on social engineering to convince users to open the malicious file, whether through email, websites, or other means.
- No special privileges needed: The attack can be performed remotely without requiring prior access to the victim's system.
