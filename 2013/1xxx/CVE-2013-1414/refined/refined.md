- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because many functions within Fortigate Firewalls are not protected by CSRF tokens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify system settings, firewall policies, or gain complete control over the firewall.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to know the IP address of the Fortigate Firewall and needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious web page that makes the malicious requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the IP address of the vulnerable Fortigate firewall and be able to trick a logged in administrator into visiting a malicious page.
