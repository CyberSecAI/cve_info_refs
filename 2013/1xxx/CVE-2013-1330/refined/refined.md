Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1330:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint Servers not properly validating input, specifically how they handle unassigned workflows. This lack of proper input validation allows for the possibility of malicious code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation.
- Missing Machine Authentication Check (MAC), allowing attackers to send arbitrary content to the target server without proper verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected server.
    - On Exchange Server, code execution occurs in the context of the Outlook Web Access (OWA) service, which runs under the Local System account by default, granting extensive privileges to the attacker.
    - On SharePoint Server, code execution occurs in the context of the W3WP service account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker sends specially crafted content to the target server.
    - For Exchange Server, this could involve sending a specifically crafted email message.
    - For SharePoint Server, this could involve sending a specially crafted URL or other content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the affected server.
- No special privileges are required.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft SharePoint Server.
- The provided documents indicate that Microsoft was aware of the public disclosure of this vulnerability before the release of security updates.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves enabling machine authentication check (MAC) according to best practices.

This vulnerability is rated as "Critical" in the provided documents, highlighting the severity of the risk.
