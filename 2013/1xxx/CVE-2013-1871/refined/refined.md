  "CVE-2013-1871": {
    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Satellite web interface performed sanitization of notes for registered systems. A remote authenticated Red Hat Satellite user could create a malicious note that, when viewed by a victim, could execute arbitrary web script with the privileges of the user viewing that note. Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the Red Hat Satellite web interface. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted link that, when visited by an authenticated Red Hat Satellite user, would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's web interface session.",
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'EditAddress.do' page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary web script execution in the context of the victim's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted URL with malicious JavaScript in the 'type' parameter of the 'EditAddress.do' page."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a logged-in user to visit it. The attacker also needs knowledge of the application's structure to be able to inject in the correct parameter."
