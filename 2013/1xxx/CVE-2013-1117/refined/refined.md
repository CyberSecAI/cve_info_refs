Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-1117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a result of a flaw in the way the Cisco WebEx WRF Player handles exceptions. Specifically, a crafted WRF file can cause corruption in the exception handler, which can lead to a crash or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Exception Handler Corruption:** The primary vulnerability lies in the WRF player's handling of exceptions, where a specially crafted WRF file can corrupt the exception handler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The most likely outcome of exploiting this vulnerability is that the WebEx WRF Player application will crash.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the targeted user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious WRF File:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing users to open a malicious WRF file.
- **Delivery Methods:** This can be achieved through various means, including:
    - **Direct File Provision:** Sending the malicious WRF file directly to users via email or other means.
    - **Malicious Web Pages:** Directing users to a web page that contains or triggers the download of the malicious WRF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious WRF File:** The attacker needs to be able to create or obtain a specially crafted WRF file that triggers the exception handler corruption vulnerability.
- **Delivery Method:** The attacker needs a means to deliver the malicious WRF file to the target user, either through direct file transfer or by hosting it on a malicious web page.
- **User Action:** The user has to be tricked into opening the malicious WRF file using the vulnerable Cisco WebEx WRF Player.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Cisco WebEx WRF Player, not the ARF player.
- The advisory also lists other related vulnerabilities in Cisco WebEx ARF and WRF players (CVE-2013-1115, CVE-2013-1116, CVE-2013-1118 and CVE-2013-1119)
