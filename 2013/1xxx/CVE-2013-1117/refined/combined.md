| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L/E:F/RL:O/RC:U/CR:L/IR:X/AR:L/MAV:L/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:R/MS:U/MC:N/MI:N/MA:N |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: |

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to crash an affected player, and in some cases, could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system of a targeted user.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx WRF Player and the Cisco WebEx ARF Player. The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27 and WBS28), Cisco WebEx 11, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server are affected by at least one of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS28) client builds prior to T28.8 (28.8)   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27) client builds prior to T27LDSP32EP16 (27.32.16)   + Cisco WebEx 11 versions prior to 1.2 SP6 (1.2.6.0) with client builds prior to T28.8 (28.8)   + Cisco WebEx Meetings Server client builds prior to T27L10NSP32\_ORION111To determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the **Support > Downloads** section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under "About Support Center." See "Software Versions and Fixes" for details.      Alternatively, version information of the Cisco WebEx Meeting client can be accessed from within the Cisco WebEx Meeting client. To determine version information of the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Windows and Linux platforms, it can be viewed by choosing **Help > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center** to determine version information of the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Mac platforms, it can be viewed by choosing **Meeting Center > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center**.      The Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.16 is fixed, build 27.32.17 will contain updated software; Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, for example, T27 SP32 EP16. The example shows the server is running client build 27.32.16.      **Note**: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS) meeting services and Cisco WebEx 11 are hosted multimedia conferencing solutions that are managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The Cisco WebEx Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers can host in their private clouds.      The ARF and WRF file formats are used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site, or on the computer of an online meeting attendee.      The Cisco WebEx ARF Player and the Cisco WebEx WRF Player are applications that are used to play back and edit WebEx ARF and WRF recording files (files with .arf and .wrf extensions).      The Cisco WebEx WRF Player and Cisco WebEx ARF Player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for stream playback mode). The Cisco WebEx ARF Player and the Cisco WebEx WRF Player can also be manually installed after downloading the application from <http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html> to play back recording files for offline playback.      The Cisco WebEx ARF player is available for all Cisco WebEx meeting site clients (WBS27, WBS28 and WebEx11) and for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server clients. The Cisco WebEx WRF Player is only available for Cisco WebEx WBS 27 and WBS28 meeting site clients and is not available for the Cisco WebEx 11 or Cisco WebEx Meetings Server clients.      The following table provides the Cisco bug IDs and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers that have been assigned for the vulnerabilities in this advisory:      | ****Title**** | ****CVE ID**** | ****Cisco Bug IDs**** |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Cisco WebEx ARF Player Memory Corruption Vulnerability | CVE-2013-1115 | CSCue74118, CSCub28371, CSCud23401 and CSCud31109 |   | Cisco WebEx ARF Player Heap Corruption Vulnerability | CVE-2013-1116 | CSCue74147 and CSCub28383 |   | Cisco WebEx WRF Player Exception Handler Corruption Vulnerability | CVE-2013-1117 | CSCuc27639 |   | Cisco WebEx WRF Player Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability | CVE-2013-1118 | CSCuc27645 |   | Cisco WebEx WRF Player JPEG DHT Index Memory Corruption Vulnerability | CVE-2013-1119 | CSCuc24503 |         Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause player applications to crash or, in some cases, remote code execution could occur.      To exploit one of these vulnerabilities, the player applications would need to open a malicious ARF or WRF file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file directly to users (for example, by using email), or by directing a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities cannot be triggered by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.  Workarounds  * While there are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities detailed in this advisory, it is possible to remove all WebEx software completely from a system using the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows users) or Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller (for Apple Mac OS X users) available at <http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html>.       Removal of WebEx software from a Linux or UNIX-based system can be accomplished by following the steps in the WebEx knowledge base help article at the following link: [https://support.webex.com/MyAccountWeb/knowledgeBase.do?root=Tools&parent=Knowledge&articleId=WBX28548&txtSearchQuery=uninstall%20linux#](https://support.webex.com/MyAccountWeb/knowledgeBase.do?root=Tools&parent=Knowledge&articleId=WBX28548&txtSearchQuery=uninstall%20linux).  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27 and WBS28) and Cisco WebEx 11 correct the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS28) client builds T28.8 (28.8) or later   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27) client builds 27.32.16 (T27LDSP32EP16) or later   + Cisco WebEx 11 1.2.6.0 (1.2 SP6) builds T28.8 (28.8) or laterClient builds of the Cisco WebEx Business Suite prior to T27 SP32 have reached end of support; to obtain fixed software please upgrade to the latest version.      The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server correct the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:   + Cisco WebEx Meetings Server client builds T27L10NSP32\_ORION111 or laterTo determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the **Support > Downloads** section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under "About Support Center." See "Software Versions and Fixes" for details. The Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.16 is fixed, build 27.32.17 will contain updated software.      The vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx WRF and ARF players. The Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the players are all affected by at least one vulnerability described in this advisory. If the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from <http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html>.      Users can manually verify the installed version of the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player to determine whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities. To do so, an administrator must examine the version numbers of the installed files and determine whether the version of the file contains the fixed code. Detailed instructions on how to verify the version numbers are provided in the following sections.      **Microsoft Windows**      Five dynamic link libraries (DLLs) were updated on the Microsoft Windows platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. These files are in the C:\Program Files\WebEx\Record Playback folder or the C:\Program Files (x86)\Webex\Record Player folder. The version number of a DLL can be obtained by browsing the Record Playback directory in Windows Explorer, right-clicking the filename, and choosing **Properties**. The **Version** or **Details** tab of the **Properties** page provides details on the library version. The following table provides the first fixed version for each DLL. If the installed versions are equal to or greater than the versions provided in the table, the system is not vulnerable.      | **Product** | Client Build | Cisco DLL Filename | DLL File Versions |   | --- | --- | --- | --- |   | WBS27 | 27.32.16 | Atas32\_Lite.dll | 1027,1232,1016,2201 |   | WBS27 | 27.32.16 | atpdmod.dll | 2029.1232.1116.2300 |   | WBS27 | 27.32.16 | atas32.dll | 1027,1232,1016,2200 |   | WBS27 | 27.32.16 | atjpg60.dll | 1027,1232,1016,2200 |   | WBS27 | 27.32.16 | atdl2006.dll | 1027,1232,1016,2200 |   | WBS27 | 27.32.16 | atprtsc.dll | 2029.1232.1116.2300 |   | WBS27 | 27.32.16 | atprtses.dll | 2029.1232.1116.2300 |   | WBS27 | 27.32.16 | nbrpd.dll | 2029.1232.1116.2300 |   | WBS28 | 28.8 | atas32\_lite.dll | 28,0800,0112,1105 |   | WBS28 | 28.8 | atas32.dll | 28,0800,0012,1105 |   | WBS28 | 28.8 | atdl2006.dll | 1028,1208,1100,0500 |   | WBS28 | 28.8 | atjpg60.dll | 2028,1208,1100,500 |   | WBS28 | 28.8 | atpdmod.dll | 2028.1208.1100.2300 |   | WBS28 | 28.8 | atprtsc.dll | 2028.1208.1100.2300 |   | WBS28 | 28.8 | atprtses.dll | 2028.1208.1100.2300 |   | WBS28 | 28.8 | nbrpd.dll | 2028.1208.1100.2300 |   | Cisco WebEx 11 | 28.8 | atas32\_lite.dll | 28,0800,0012,1105 |   | Cisco WebEx 11 | 28.8 | atas32.dll | 28,0800,0012,1105 |   | Cisco WebEx 11 | 28.8 | atdl2006.dll | 1028,1208,1100,0500 |   | Cisco WebEx 11 | 28.8 | atjpg60.dll | 2028,1208,1100,500 |   | Cisco WebEx 11 | 28.8 | atpdmod.dll | 2028.1208.1100.2300 |   | Cisco WebEx 11 | 28.8 | atprtsc.dll | 2028.1208.1100.2300 |   | Cisco WebEx 11 | 28.8 | atprtses.dll | 2028.1208.1100.2300 |   | Cisco WebEx 11 | 28.8 | nbrpd.dll | 2028.1208.1100.2300 |   | Cisco WebEx Meetings Server | T27L10NSP32\_ORION111 | atpdmod.dll | 2029.1332.400.1703 |   | Cisco WebEx Meetings Server | T27L10NSP32\_ORION111 | nbrpd.dll | 2029.1332.400.1703 |   | Cisco WebEx Meetings Server | T27L10NSP32\_ORION111 | pdcvt.dll | 2029.1332.400.1703 |   | Cisco WebEx Meetings Server | T27L10NSP32\_ORION111 | atprtses.dll | 2029.1332.400.1703 |   | Cisco WebEx Meetings Server | T27L10NSP32\_ORION111 | atprtsc.dll | 2029.1332.400.1703 |         **Apple Mac OS X**      Four package bundles were updated on the Apple Mac OS platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.

| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:POC/RL/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |
