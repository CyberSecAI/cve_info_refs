Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-1484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper permission check issues within the Libraries component of OpenJDK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the insufficient permission checks within the OpenJDK Libraries component. This lack of proper checks allows for unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An untrusted Java application or applet can exploit this vulnerability to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This means an attacker could potentially gain access to system resources or perform actions that they normally would not be permitted to do within the Java sandbox.
- Specifically, the Ubuntu advisory states that an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service.
- The Gentoo advisory mentions that exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, sensitive information disclosure, bypassing security policies, or other unspecified impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through untrusted Java applications or applets.
- This could occur via a malicious website hosting a compromised Java applet that a user loads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deploy an untrusted Java application or applet that can reach a vulnerable OpenJDK instance.
- This could mean compromising a web server and injecting a malicious applet, or by getting a user to execute a malicious application directly.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability to craft an exploit that can bypass the inadequate permission checks.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in OpenJDK.
- Multiple sources indicate this vulnerability was fixed in Java 7 Update 15 and Java 6 Update 41.
- The US-CERT advisory emphasizes the risk associated with web browsers using the Java plugin.

In summary, CVE-2013-1484 represents a vulnerability in OpenJDK where improper permission checks allow untrusted Java code to bypass sandbox restrictions, potentially leading to various malicious outcomes including arbitrary code execution and denial of service. The attack vector involves the execution of malicious Java applets or applications.
