  "CVE-2013-1813": {
    "description": "The mdev utility in Busybox 1.21.0 and earlier creates intermediate directories with world-writable permissions when creating device nodes in nested directories, which allows local users to manipulate portions of the /dev directory tree.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `mdev` utility in BusyBox was creating intermediate directories with mode 0777 (world-writable) instead of 0755 when creating device nodes or symlinks in nested subdirectories within /dev, leading to insecure directory permissions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure Permissions",
        "Incorrect directory creation mode"
      ],
       "impact": "A local, unprivileged user could manipulate the /dev directory tree by creating nested directories with world-writable permissions, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access",
        "Manipulation of device nodes or symlinks through mdev"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Ability to execute mdev commands to create nested directories within /dev"
    },
    "affected_systems": [
      "BusyBox versions 1.21.0 and earlier",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6",
      "WAGO 852 Industrial Managed Switch Series",
	   "ZTE mobile Hotspot MS910S",
     "Phoenix Contact TC Router & TC Cloud Client"
    ],
    "remediation": "Apply the patch or upgrade to a fixed version of BusyBox, or upgrade the vulnerable device firmware.",
