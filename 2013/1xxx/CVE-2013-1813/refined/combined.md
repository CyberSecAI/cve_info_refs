Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review of these products
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve all security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.18.5 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

2) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2020-9436)
An authenticated command injection vulnerability can be triggered by issuing a
POST request to the "/cgi-bin/p/adm/cfg" CGI program which is available on the
web interface. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to compromise the
operating system of the device. This issue was found by emulating the firmware
of the device.

3) Embedded Private X.509 Certificate (CVE-2020-9435)
The device contains a hardcoded certificate which can be used to run the web
service. This certificate is used for HTTPS (default server certificate for
web based configuration and management).

Impersonation, man-in-the-middle or passive decryption attacks are possible.
These attacks allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information like
admin credentials and use them in further attacks.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.18.5 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2014-9645 and CVE-2013-1813.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device:

A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created to trigger the
vulnerability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2020-9436)
An authenticated command injection is possible via a crafted POST request.

The configuration upload form in the web-interface can be used to upload an XML
configuration file. The filename of this XML file can be modified with an
interceptor proxy in order to inject system commands. The JavaScript code which
is used to do client-side filtering can be bypassed in this way. Because of
blacklisting of some characters, the ${IFS} command must be used for adding
whitespaces.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor recommends to change the hardware and use a newer product.

SEC Consult recommends to remove the device from productive environments.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hard-coded Administrator Password
The hard-coded administrator password was found in the ZTE mobile hotspot
MS910S firmware version "CN_EUV1.00.01", which is available at.
<http://devicedownload.zte.com.cn/support/product/201701161506340/soft/20170116151106465.zip>

2) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.15.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scalable firmware run-time.

3) Known Backdoor in GoAhead Webserver
An unusual "telnetd" port was identified on an emulated device which led to the
assumption that a backdoor can be opened via the GoAhead web-server.
This conclusion was done because of a blog post from another researcher:
<http://blog.asiantuntijakaveri.fi/2017/03/backdoor-and-root-shell-on-zte-mf286.html>

By partially reverse engineering the binaries of the GoAhead webserver, the
functionality described in the corresponding blog post can be underpinned.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hard-coded Administrator Password
The firmware file (ZTE_MF910SV1.0.1B09.bin) is using the JFFS2 filesystem which
was extracted. The hardcoded password can be found in the /etc/shadow file
within the firmware:

/_DL_MF910S_CN_EUV1.00.01.exe.extracted/Data/version/_ZTE_MF910SV1.0.1B09.bin.extracted/jffs2-root/fs_1/etc/shadow

The file content is shown below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root:$1$$zdlNHiCDxYDfeF4MZL.H3/:10933:0:99999:7:::
Admin:$1$$zdlNHiCDxYDfeF4MZL.H3/:10933:0:99999:7:::
bin::10933:0:99999:7:::
daemon::10933:0:99999:7:::
adm::10933:0:99999:7:::
lp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
sync:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
shutdown:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
halt:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
uucp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
operator:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
nobody::10933:0:99999:7:::
ap71::10933:0:99999:7:::
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both the user "root" and "admin" are using the same weak hardcoded password
"5up".

2) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was crea-
ted to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Known Backdoor in GoAhead Webserver
Starting the telnet daemon on the emulated device leads to a listener on a very
unusual port:
[...]
# telnetd
#netstat -tulen
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4719            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
[...]

Because this seems to be not configured on the system by any file, the BusyBox
binary was inspected.

The pseudocode snippet of BusyBox' telnetd function that was generated by Hex-
Rays ARM Decompiler, indicated that this port was hard-coded:
<snip>
dword_788DC = (int)"/bin/login";
  dword_788E0 = (int)"/etc/issue.net";
  v3 = sub_5DBFC(a2, "f:l:Kip:b:F", &dword_788E0, &dword_788DC, &v76, &v75);
  v4 = v3 & 8;
  v5 = v3;
  if ( !(v3 & 8) && !(v3 & 0x40) )
    sub_64A10(v3 & 8);
  if ( (v5 & 0x48) != 64 )
  {
    openlog((const char *)dword_798DC, 1, 24);
    dword_78630 = 2;
  }
  if ( v5 & 0x10 )
    v6 = sub_64FF8(v76);
  else
    v6 = 4719; <------------------------------------- Port "4719"
  if ( !v4 )
  {
    v2 = sub_65578(v75, v6);
    sub_E394(v2, 1);
    sub_D9B0(v2);
    goto LABEL_13;
  }
  dword_788D8 = (int)sub_1C480(0);
  if ( dword_788D8 )
  {
<snip>

This led to the assumption that the GoAhead webserver was modified like
described in the following blog post:
<http://blog.asiantuntijakaveri.fi/2017/03/backdoor-and-root-shell-on-zte-mf286.html>

Inspecting the GoAhead webserver binary reinforces this assumption. The
pseudocode was generated with Hex-Rays ARM Decompiler, like for the prior
BusyBox binary:
<snip>
int __fastcall sub_21D48(int a1)
{
  int v1; // r5
  const char *v2; // r4

  v1 = a1;
  cfg_get("debug_level");
  v2 = (const char *)sub_17DF0(v1, "change_mode", "");
  cfg_set("login_9527", "1");
  if ( !strcmp("1", v2) )
  {
    cfg_set("change_mode", "1");
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("mode_change 1");
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("2", v2) ) <--- change mode "2"
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("telnetd &"); <--------- telnet daemon started
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("3", v2) )
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("rem_start.sh &");
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("4", v2) )
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("rem_kill.sh &");
  }
  else
  {
    cfg_set("change_mode", "0");
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("mode_change 0");
  }
  return sub_34374(v1, "success");
}
<snip>

Other scripts could also be started via the webserver, like "rem_start.sh".
This script contains the following lines:

#!/bin/sh
if ps|grep remserial
then
echo "remserial is running.."
else
remserial -p 10005 -r 192.168.1.10 -s "115200 raw" /dev/ttyUSB0 &
fi

That means, that a serial console with the speed of 115200 Baud on port 10005
is started.

Subject: busybox mdev creates deep subdirs in /dev with 0777 permissions
Date: Fri, 01 Mar 2013 12:44:36 +0400
```
Package: busybox
Version: 1:1.20.0-7
Severity: important
Tags: security patch upstream fixed-upstream pending

When device node or symlink in /dev should be created inside
2-or-deeper subdirectory (/dev/dir1/dir2.../node), the
intermediate directories are incorrectly created with mode
0777, which is an obvious security issue.

mdev is an alternative for udev, but since udev is used
almost universally, and many packages depend on it, mdev
isn't used often.  Also, subdirs of more than one level
are not common, especially with mdev which, unlike udev,
has limited "language" to construct filenames/symlinks,
so often, when mdev is used, a task of creating device
nodes with complex names is implemented using an external
script instead.  However it is important to fix this to
avoid surprizes.

The issue has been fixed upstream in commit
4609f477c7e043a4f6147dfe6e86b775da2ef784.

## Topic

Updated busybox packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

BusyBox provides a single binary that includes versions of a large number
of system commands, including a shell. This can be very useful for
recovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those
involving broken shared libraries.

It was found that the mdev BusyBox utility could create certain directories
within /dev with world-writable permissions. A local unprivileged user
could use this flaw to manipulate portions of the /dev directory tree.
(CVE-2013-1813)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, due to a too eager string size optimization on the IBM System

z architecture, the "wc" BusyBox command failed after processing standard
input with the following error:

wc: : No such file or directory

This bug was fixed by disabling the string size optimization and the "wc"
command works properly on IBM System z architectures. (BZ#820097)

* Prior to this update, the "mknod" command was unable to create device

nodes with a major or minor number larger than 255. Consequently, the kdump
utility failed to handle such a device. The underlying source code has been
modified, and it is now possible to use the "mknod" command to create
device nodes with a major or minor number larger than 255. (BZ#859817)

* If a network installation from an NFS server was selected, the "mount"

command used the UDP protocol by default. If only TCP mounts were supported
by the server, this led to a failure of the mount command. As a result,
Anaconda could not continue with the installation. This bug is now fixed
and NFS mount operations default to the TCP protocol. (BZ#855832)

All busybox users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:

According to the vendor, the following versions are affected:
* 852-303: <v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: <v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: <v1.1.5.S0

2019-06-07: VDE CERT provides security advisory information from WAGO;
            WAGO releases security patches
2019-06-12: Coordinated release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides patches to their customers at their download page. The
following versions fix the issues:
* 852-303: v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: v1.1.5.S0

According to the vendor, busybox and glibc have been updated and the embedded
private keys are being newly generated upon first boot and after a factory reset.
The root login via Telnet and SSH has been disabled and the admin account is
documented and can be changed by the customer.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the device & SSH server.
