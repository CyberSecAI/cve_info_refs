Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access checks in the "Node Parameter Control" Drupal module. Specifically, the module does not properly verify user permissions before allowing access to view and edit its configuration options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Access Bypass:** The core issue is an access bypass vulnerability. Both anonymous and authenticated users could view and edit the configuration settings of the module, which should be restricted to administrative users.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The module lacks proper checks to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify its configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Configuration Tampering:** Attackers, including anonymous users, can potentially modify the module's settings. This could lead to:
    - Unintended changes to node edit forms.
    - Disclosure of potentially sensitive information.
    - Disrupting the intended functionality of the site.
    - The severity of the vulnerability was marked as "Critical".

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning attackers can exploit it over a network without needing local access to the server.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the web interface of the Drupal site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need only network access to the affected Drupal site.
- **No Prior Authentication (for some impacts):** Both anonymous users and authenticated users can exploit the vulnerability, indicating no special user privileges are required for at least some level of impact.

**Additional Notes:**
- The module maintainer marked the module as unsupported instead of providing a patch.
- The recommended solution is to uninstall the affected module.
- The vulnerability affects all 6.x-1.x versions of the module.
