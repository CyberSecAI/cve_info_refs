  "cve": "CVE-2013-1923",
  "description": "The rpc.gssd daemon in nfs-utils is vulnerable to DNS spoofing. It depends on PTR resolution for GSSAPI authentication. An attacker can redirect a user to the wrong server by manipulating DNS responses, leading to the disclosure of confidential data.",
  "affected_components": [
    "nfs-utils",
    "rpc.gssd"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The rpc.gssd daemon in nfs-utils relies on PTR (reverse DNS) records for GSSAPI authentication. This dependency creates a vulnerability because PTR records can be spoofed by an attacker.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "DNS spoofing",
    "Insecure dependency on PTR records for authentication",
     "Man-in-the-middle attack (potential)"
  ],
   "impact": "An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious server by spoofing PTR records. This allows the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to data or induce the user to trust improper data. For example, if a user mounts a directory from a secure server, and the attacker redirects the user to a public server, any files copied to the mount point would go to the public server. This can lead to a disclosure of confidential data and allow unauthorized modification of data.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "DNS spoofing or poisoning",
    "Man-in-the-middle attack (by intercepting and modifying network traffic)"
   ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
    "Ability to manipulate DNS records",
    "Ability to redirect network traffic"
  ],
  "additional_details": [
        "The vulnerability occurs because the client's rpc.gssd daemon queries PTR records to determine the server's canonical name for GSSAPI authentication. This makes the authentication susceptible to DNS poisoning.",
        "The vulnerability can be mitigated by using the '-N off' flag which prevents reverse DNS lookups.",
        "Setting the IP/host pair in `/etc/hosts` can also prevent DNS spoofing.",
        "The issue can be exploited in a MITM scenario where the attacker redirects the user to a different server by manipulating DNS traffic. This is possible if the forward name of the server is reasonable but the PTR record is different or missing.",
        "The vulnerability can lead to a user inadvertently mounting a different server than the intended one, allowing the attacker to intercept or modify data."
