you use the "-N off" switch and rely on reverse resolution I guess.
(about to send patch that fixes -N as Jeff asked).

I'll look.

It's a MITM setting.

Suppose you have 2 servers:

secure.server.name where you store confidential documents
public.server.name where everyone have access for reading (and you can
write)

If you mount -t nfs secure.server.name/export and rely on PTR records
and an attacker can spoof your PTR request to return public.server.name
you will end up acquiring a ticket for public.server.name from the KDC.
Then the attacker will redirect your mount to public.server.name all the
while you think you have mounted secure.server.name

Now anything you copy there goes to a public server instead of your
secure server.

Now imagine your secure server is a backup server which gets mounted by
a cron job every night for backups of sensitive information.

Simo.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=948072#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-04-03 22:27:44 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that rpc.gssd in nfs-utils is vulnerable to DNS spoofing due to it depending on PTR resolution for GSSAPI authentication.  Because of this, if a user where able to poison DNS to a victim's computer, they would be able to trick rpc.gssd into talking to another server (perhaps with less security) than the intended server (with stricter security).  If the victim has write access to the second (less secure) server, and the attacker has read access (when they normally might not on the secure server), the victim could write files to that server, which the attacker could obtain (when normally they would not be able to).  To the victim this is transparent because the victim's computer asks the KDC for a ticket to the second server due to reverse DNS resolution; in this case Krb5 authentication does not fail because the victim is talking to the "correct" server.  A patch that prevents this issue has been posted [3].  To workaround this issue, set the IP/host pair in /etc/hosts so that it cannot be spoofed.  A good explanation is also available here [4].

openSUSE Security Update: update for nfs-utils
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2013:1016-1

Cross-References: CVE-2013-1923
Affected Products:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update of nfs-utils includes several bug and security
fixes.
- gssd-reverse-dns-fix: Allow DNS lookups to be avoided
when determining kerberos identity of server. The
GSSD\_OPTIONS sysconfig variable is added so that use of
DNS can be enforced for sites that need it. (bnc#813464
CVE-2013-1923)
- gssd-n.fix: linux-3.7 changed behaviour of gssd lookups
so that "gssd -n" isn't sufficient to stop the use of
"machine credentials". This patch add "-N" which stops
the new use as well. Also add GSSD\_OPTIONS to sysconfig
so these flags can be set more easily. (bnc#817651)
- mountd-fix-exporting-of-with-sec-setting.patch Fix bug
when exporting root filesystem with gss security.
(bnc#809226)
- mountd-fix-error-check.patch: check for errors with
exporting filesystems correctly (bnc#809226)
- nfsserver.init: make sure warning about bind= being
deprecated goes to terminal and not into
/run/nfs/bind.mounts (bnc#809226)
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 12.3:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2013-493
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".
Package List:
- openSUSE 12.3 (i586 x86\_64):

Yeah I figured that just concentrating on the functional aspect of being
able to work on networks with missing PTR records is sufficient to
explain why this patchset is good :-)

However let me give a try at explaining in a different way using the
same example I gave before but from a different angle.

- Assume user Alice has very important documents that are backed up
daily to a server named secure.server.name where Alice can write to and
nobody can read from.
- Assume an attacker Eve, that is in the condition of intercepting and
modifying all network traffic from Alice.
- Assume there exist another server called public.server.name where
Alice can write to and Eve can read from.

Eve wants to fool Alice in mounting /export from public.server.name
instead or secure.server.name so she can copy Alice's documents away.

So Eve, manipulates traffic and when Alice's machine tries to talk to
secure.server.name, Eve redirects all the traffic to public.server.name
instead. (Can be done by a simple DNS poisoning attack that gives back
to Alice computer the public.server.name IP address, or by actual DNAT
on Alice's computer packets).
Now, normally, if Krb5 authentication is used the mount would fail,
because Alice would try to authenticate to public.server.com using a
ticket she obtained to talk to secure.server.com (remember that Alice
thinks she is mounting the secure.server.name share).

Here the reverse DNS resolution performed by Alice's computer's rpc.gssd
daemon is what allows Eve to successfully redirect Alice's mount
instead. Because at the time Alice's computer needs to grab a ticket for
the 'target' server, Eve fakes the DNS replies and tells Alice's
computer that the destination name for the secure.server.name's IP
address is 'public.server.name'.

So with current behavior Alice's computer asks the KDC for a ticket for
'public.server.name' instead of 'secure.server.name'.

Now Krb5 authentication does not fail anymore because Alice does have
the 'right' ticket for the server it is connecting to.

Alice authentication against the 'substituted' (by Eve, through packet
redirection) server therefore succeeds, and her computer is fooled to
think it really mounted secure.server.name when it really has mounted
public.server.name, the cron job for the backup starts and copies all
files to public.server.name, where Eve can find and access them.

Call it MITM, call it something else, it's an attack, and we can prevent
it.

HTH,
Simo.
