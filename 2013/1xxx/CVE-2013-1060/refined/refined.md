{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Ubuntu build procedure for perf sets the HOME environment variable to the ~buildd directory, leading to the system configuration file being read from there.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper setting of the HOME environment variable during the build process of perf tool allows for system configuration files to be read from the build directory instead of the correct system directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local users can gain elevated privileges by manipulating the configuration files within the ~buildd directory.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system is required to manipulate the buildd account or its home directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs local user access and the ability to manipulate the files in the buildd user's home directory."
