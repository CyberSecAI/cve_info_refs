  "CVE-2013-1730": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is due to a compartment mismatch when re-attaching XBL-backed nodes in Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by moving certain XBL-backed nodes from a document into a replacement document created by document.open(), causing a JavaScript compartment mismatch that can lead to exploitable conditions.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A JavaScript compartment mismatch when re-attaching XBL-backed nodes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of JavaScript compartments during DOM manipulation."
      ],
      "impact": "A denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the affected application.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Tricking a user into opening a specially crafted web page or email.",
          "Specifically crafted HTML or XUL content that manipulates DOM nodes, particularly XBL-backed elements within a context that involves document.open()"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious web page or email with specific JavaScript and DOM manipulation."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "Mozilla Firefox",
        "Mozilla Firefox ESR",
      "Mozilla SeaMonkey",
        "Mozilla Thunderbird",
      "Mozilla Thunderbird ESR"
    ],
    "patch_information": [
      "Fixed in Firefox 24",
      "Fixed in Firefox ESR 17.0.9",
      "Fixed in SeaMonkey 2.21",
      "Fixed in Thunderbird 24",
      "Fixed in Thunderbird ESR 17.0.9"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was turned into a run-time assertion in Firefox 20, which would crash the browser without the possibility of code execution. A fix was included in Firefox 24, addressing the root cause of the issue.  Scripting is disabled by default for HTML email, limiting the attack vector in Thunderbird, while browser-like contexts remain vulnerable."
