Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way HTML strings are sanitized in Microsoft Office components, specifically within a shared component also present in Microsoft InfoPath 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft Groove Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010, and Microsoft Office Web Apps 2010.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper HTML sanitization leading to a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Insufficient filtering of HTML elements, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute scripts within the security context of the current user.
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could perform XSS attacks on affected systems.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could read content they are not authorized to access.
- **Impersonation:** Attackers could use the victim's identity to perform actions on the targeted site or application.
- **Potentially:** Run arbitrary code (though the main impact is XSS and EoP, the provided text only says that it *could* be possible to execute arbitrary code, and does not confirm this as a direct impact for this CVE)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Content:** An attacker would need to entice a user to view specially crafted content, typically within SharePoint.
- **Compromised Websites:** Malicious websites or websites hosting user-provided content could contain specially crafted content to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Phishing:** Attackers might use phishing emails or instant messages containing links to malicious websites to lure users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious HTML content that bypasses sanitization.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver this content to a target user through a vulnerable Microsoft application (SharePoint, etc) or through a malicious website.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious content or visiting a malicious website.
- No specific user privileges are necessary for the attack itself. However, the impact of the attack depends on the targeted user's permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability at the time of publishing.
- The updates address the vulnerability by modifying how HTML strings are sanitized.
- The vulnerability also exists in InfoPath 2010 but it is not directly exploitable since it does not access the vulnerable code. However, updates for InfoPath 2010 are provided to ensure all products containing the vulnerable code use the same, patched version.
- There are no known workarounds for the vulnerability.
