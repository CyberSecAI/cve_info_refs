Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1996:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a sign extension issue when calculating the size of memory to allocate within the `FSOpenServer()` function of the `libFS` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Sign Extension Issue:** A `char` variable, `altlen`, receives a value from the network and is later cast to an `int`. If the `char` value is negative (e.g., `0xff`), it gets sign-extended into a negative `int` which leads to a zero-sized allocation.
- **Integer Overflow**: The calculation `altlen + 1` can result in an integer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** Due to the incorrect calculation of memory size, `FSmalloc` allocates an insufficient buffer. Subsequently, the `memmove` function writes past the allocated buffer when copying the server-provided data, leading to memory corruption. This memory corruption can potentially cause a denial-of-service (application crash) or allow arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious X server sending specially crafted data in response to a client request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to control an X server that a vulnerable client application connects to.
- The attacker must be able to send crafted responses to the client via the X server. This is more likely in scenarios where a less privileged user controls the server but a privileged client connects to it (e.g., setuid X client connected to a virtual X server like Xvfb or Xephyr).

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was reported by Ilja van Sprundel from IOActive.
- The fix involves proper handling of the size calculations and avoiding the sign extension issue.
- The affected versions of libFS are 1.0.4 and earlier.
- The fix for this vulnerability is present in libFS version 1.0.5.
- The provided information also includes references to the specific commit that fixed this issue in the libFS git repository.
