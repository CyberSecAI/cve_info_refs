  "CVE-2013-1275": {
    "Description": "Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of objects in memory",
       "Race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. Then, they could run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Valid logon credentials and ability to log on locally."
