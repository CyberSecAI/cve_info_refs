| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.7 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.7 |

The **Remember Me** authentication option is enabled by default.      Cisco   Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Server is not affected by the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server Authentication Bypass Vulnerability.         **Note:** Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server and Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing   Server software versions prior to 7.0 reached end of software maintenance. Customers   with devices running versions prior to 7.0 should contact their Cisco support team   for assistance in upgrading to a supported version.         **Information about Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Express**      Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Express is affected by the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server Authentication Bypass Vulnerability.   Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Express reached end of software maintenance. Customers should contact their Cisco support team   for available replacement.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Unified MeetingPlace is an on-premises conferencing solution that allows organizations to host integrated voice, video,   and web conferencing. The solution is integrated directly into an organization's private voice/data networks   and enterprise applications. Cisco Unified MeetingPlace servers can be   deployed so that the server is accessible from the Internet, allowing   external parties to participate in meetings.      Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server is the core of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace solution and provides voice and video services, and general support to other components of the solution. Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web   Conferencing Server is a component of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace solution that allows users to manage meetings and share applications and   presentations.      **Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the authentication code of the webserver component of Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take over a user session after the user has logged out from the affected system.   The vulnerability is due to the affected system not invalidating a user's session when the user logs out. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP GET or POST request and sending it to the affected system. To succeed, the attacker must know the session cookie value from a user that has previously logged out. The Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server will automatically invalidate the session cookie after 30 minutes; therefore the attacker has 30 minutes to perform attack. An exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate a legitimate user and compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system with the privileges of that user.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuc64885](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc64885) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1168.      **Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Server Arbitrary Login Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the authentication code of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impersonate a legitimate user and issue arbitrary commands to the affected system.   The vulnerability is due to insufficient verification of the user cookies when the **Remember Me** option is configured on the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a login request and send it to the affected system. The attacker must know a valid user name to execute the attack. An exploit   could allow the attacker to impersonate a legitimate user and compromise the   confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system with   the privileges of that user.      **Note:** this vulnerability affects only Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing servers that are configured with the **Remember Me** option. Microsoft Outlook Integration is using the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server for authentication services, and it is not affected by this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuc64846](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc64846) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1169.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that mitigate the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server Authentication Bypass Vulnerability.      Disabling the **Remember Me** authentication option mitigates the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Server Arbitrary Login Vulnerability.   To disable the **Remember Me** authentication option, navigate to **Home > Administration > Web Server** and under Web Server Customization Values section set **Allow Remember Me** value to *No*.
