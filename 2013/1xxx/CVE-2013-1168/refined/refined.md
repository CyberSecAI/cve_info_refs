Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1168:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server's web server component not invalidating user sessions upon logout.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Management Flaw:**  The application fails to properly terminate user sessions when a user logs out, leaving the session active.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can hijack a user session after the user has logged out, gaining access to the system as that user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker inherits the privileges of the compromised user.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Compromise:**  Exploitation can lead to unauthorized disclosure of information, modification of data, and denial of service, all with the same privileges as the legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring any prior authentication.
*   **HTTP GET/POST Requests:** Attackers can craft HTTP GET or POST requests to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected system.
*   **Knowledge of Session Cookie:** The attacker must know a valid session cookie from a user who has previously logged out. This could be obtained through various means outside the scope of this specific vulnerability.
*   **Timing:**  The attacker has a 30-minute window to exploit the session after a user logs out, as the session cookie is automatically invalidated after 30 minutes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server.
*   The provided CVSS vector string `AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C` accurately reflects the severity and characteristics of the vulnerability:
    *   **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
    *   **AC:M (Medium):** The attack complexity is medium because the attacker requires a valid session cookie.
    *   **Au:N (None):** No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **C:C (Complete):** Complete impact on confidentiality
    *   **I:C (Complete):** Complete impact on integrity
    *   **A:C (Complete):** Complete impact on availability
    *   **E:F (Functional):** Functional exploit code is available.
    *   **RL:OF (Official Fix):** An official fix is available.
    *   **RC:C (Confirmed):** The vulnerability is confirmed.
*   The vulnerability is identified with Cisco Bug ID CSCuc64885.
*   The advisory notes that there are no known public announcements or exploitation in the wild at the time of writing.
*  Fixed versions are specified for various releases.
