{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2013-1764",
  "description": "The PackageKit zypp backend was fixed to only allow patches to be updated. Otherwise a regular user could install new packages or even downgrade older packages to ones with security problems.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The PackageKit zypp backend did not properly validate package versions during update operations, allowing downgrades.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of package versions during updates",
       "The 'update' method allowed installing non-update resolvables like patterns or even new packages"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to install a previously fixed package with known security problems, potentially compromising the system.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system is required to exploit this issue through the PackageKit 'update' functionality.",
     "required_capabilities": "A standard, logged-in desktop user is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "PackageKit",
      "openSUSE 12.3"
