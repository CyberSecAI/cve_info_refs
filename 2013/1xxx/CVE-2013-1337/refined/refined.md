Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-1337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft .NET Framework's failure to properly create policy requirements for authentication when setting up custom Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) endpoint authentication. This improper policy creation occurs when using the `userNamePasswordValidationMode` parameter, specifically with `netHttpsBinding` or `basicHttpsBinding` classes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Security Feature Bypass: The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism of a WCF endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to endpoint functions as if they were an authenticated user.
- Depending on the application, this could lead to information theft or the ability to take actions on behalf of an authenticated user. The impact is highly application-specific. Applications that do not perform proper validation are more vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can send specially crafted queries to a vulnerable WCF endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a WCF endpoint that is configured to use custom authentication with the vulnerable settings (`netHttpsBinding` or `basicHttpsBinding` using `userNamePasswordValidationMode`).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to custom WCF endpoint authentication when using `userNamePasswordValidationMode` with `netHttpsBinding` or `basicHttpsBinding`.
- The default WCF authentication mode "Windows" is not vulnerable.
- The provided document also states this vulnerability was publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released.
