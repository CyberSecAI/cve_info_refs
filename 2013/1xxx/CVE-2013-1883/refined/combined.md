This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix filter api issue with 'any condition' and text search

[Browse files](/mantisbt/mantisbt/tree/d16988c3ca232a751c91702eb0331f929f56858c)

```
A filter combining some criteria and a text search with 'any condition'
results in a cartesian product, which has the potential to bring down
the site as the RDBMS eats up all available resources.

The root cause of this behavior is joining the bug_text table with a
from clause and setting the join's criteria in the query's where clause,
without taking consideration the operator's precedence (AND/OR).

This commit resolves the problem by using a JOIN clause instead, which
makes the query cleaner.

Fixes #15573

# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=924340#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-21 15:11:14 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way MantisBT, a free popular web-based issue tracking system, performed processing of certain type of View Issues page search queries. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted query (filter combining some criteria and a text search with 'any condition') that, when processed by the MantisBT system, would lead to excessive system resources consumption (denial of service), possibly leading to complete MantisBT server instance unavailability.  References: [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/03/21/3>  Upstream bug report: [2] <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=15573>  Relevant upstream patch: [3] <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/d16988c3ca232a7>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=924340#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-21 15:13:05 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the mantis package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17, 18, and Fedora EPEL-5. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=924340#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-21 15:14:09 UTC  ``` Created mantis tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 924341](show_bug.cgi?id=924341 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1883 mantis: Site / db server DoS via certain View Issues page search query [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 924342](show_bug.cgi?id=924342 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1883 mantis: Site / db server DoS via certain View Issues page search query [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=924340#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-22 09:49:00 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2013-1883](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1883) has been assigned:    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/03/22/2>  to this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=924340#c4)  Fedora Update System    2013-04-01 03:26:03 UTC  ``` mantis-1.2.14-1.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=924340#c5)  Fedora Update System    2013-04-01 03:32:18 UTC  ``` mantis-1.2.14-1.fc17 has been pushed to the Fedora 17 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=924340#c6)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-10 11:00:22 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products.   ``` |  |

Fix filter api issue with 'any condition' and text search

[Browse files](/mantisbt/mantisbt/tree/d16988c3ca232a751c91702eb0331f929f56858c)

```
A filter combining some criteria and a text search with 'any condition'
results in a cartesian product, which has the potential to bring down
the site as the RDBMS eats up all available resources.

The root cause of this behavior is joining the bug_text table with a
from clause and setting the join's criteria in the query's where clause,
without taking consideration the operator's precedence (AND/OR).

This commit resolves the problem by using a JOIN clause instead, which
makes the query cleaner.

Fixes #15573

| Summary | 0015573: CVE-2013-1883: One query can be issued via current Mantis interface to take down site | | | | |
| Description | This is a very bad query problem that can be used as a DOS attack very easily. I found it while upgrading 1.1.18 to 1.2.14. When I ran it on your site yesterday... somewhere around 5pm EST, it took you down too! (Sorry but proved the issue!)  In my situation, I had to kill the offending thread in MySQL and restart Apache to get my site back online.  The query caused MySQL to take all of the cpu on my solaris box...  It has to do with the search feature "Match Type: Any Condition"  Basically it is broken badly WHEN USED WITH A TEXT STRING SEARCH.  All you have to do to reproduce this is search a large dataset for any text string from the View Issues search box.  Searching with the default "Match Type: All Conditions" should yield expected results.  Now switch Match Type to "Any Condition" and press Apply Filter.... and watch your site... die.  This is all compounded (TERRIBLY) by the feature that stores your last View Issues query and automatically reissues it when you click View Issues.... now you DOS your site every time you click View Issues!  To get control back from this mishap I was forced to remove my cookie so the offending search was not automatically reissued. | | | | |
| Steps To Reproduce | All you have to do to reproduce this is search a large dataset for any text string from the View Issues search box.  Searching with the default "Match Type: All Conditions" should yield expected results.  Now switch Match Type to "Any Condition" and press Apply Filter.... and watch your site... die. | | | | |
| Additional Information | When using the fast All Conditions to search for the string "sql", this query is issued:  Count( DISTINCT mantis\_bug\_table.id ) as idcnt FROM mantis\_bug\_text\_table, man tis\_project\_table, mantis\_bug\_table LEFT JOIN mantis\_bugnote\_table ON mantis\_bu g\_table.id = mantis\_bugnote\_table.bug\_id LEFT JOIN mantis\_bugnote\_text\_table ON mantis\_bugnote\_table.bugnote\_text\_id = mantis\_bugnote\_text\_table.id WHERE manti s\_project\_table.enabled = 1 AND mantis\_project\_table.id = mantis\_bug\_table.proje ct\_id AND ( mantis\_bug\_table.project\_id in (6, 282, 94, 151, 176, 376, 194, 321, 199, 44, 43, 111, 273, 45, 41, 58, 155, 333, 48, 297, 298, 213, 299) ) AND ( ma ntis\_bug\_table.bug\_text\_id = mantis\_bug\_text\_table.id AND ( ( (summary LIKE '%sq l%') OR (mantis\_bug\_text\_table.description LIKE '%sql%') OR (mantis\_bug\_text\_tab le.steps\_to\_reproduce LIKE '%sql%') OR (mantis\_bug\_text\_table.additional\_informa tion LIKE '%sql%') OR (mantis\_bugnote\_text\_table.note LIKE '%sql%') ) ) )  When using the tragically slow "Any Condition" query for the string "sql", this query is issued:  Count( DISTINCT mantis\_bug\_table.id ) as idcnt FROM mantis\_bug\_text\_table, man tis\_project\_table, mantis\_bug\_table LEFT JOIN mantis\_bugnote\_table ON mantis\_bu g\_table.id = mantis\_bugnote\_table.bug\_id LEFT JOIN mantis\_bugnote\_text\_table ON mantis\_bugnote\_table.bugnote\_text\_id = mantis\_bugnote\_text\_table.id WHERE manti s\_project\_table.enabled = 1 AND mantis\_project\_table.id = mantis\_bug\_table.proje ct\_id AND ( mantis\_bug\_table.project\_id in (6, 282, 94, 151, 176, 376, 194, 321, 199, 44, 43, 111, 273, 45, 41, 58, 155, 333, 48, 297, 298, 213, 299) ) AND ( ma ntis\_bug\_table.bug\_text\_id = mantis\_bug\_text\_table.id OR ( ( (summary LIKE '%sql %') OR (mantis\_bug\_text\_table.description LIKE '%sql%') OR (mantis\_bug\_text\_tabl e.steps\_to\_reproduce LIKE '%sql%') OR (mantis\_bug\_text\_table.additional\_informat ion LIKE '%sql%') OR (mantis\_bugnote\_text\_table.note LIKE '%sql%') ) ) )  Basically, you cannot "OR" the primary key of the LEFT-JOINED mantis\_bug\_text table, while attempting to match against it's description field. Well...you obviously CAN...but the results are tragic.  When I change that OR to an AND the query runs quickly. | | | | |

The query's performance with ANY condition is about the same as for ALL (whereas before I killed mysql after 30 minutes of execution).  As a side note and while on the topic of performance, I'm not sure why we are using an outer join on the bugnote\_text table, in theory it should be a 1:1 relationship so an inner join would be enough and be more efficient.  It may also be useful from a readability perspective, to rewrite the query to use a JOIN clause for the mantis\_bug\_text\_table and mantis\_project\_table. This way the where clauses would only relate to the filter criteria. |

Wouldn't an inner join require that the bugnote\_text\_table exist? |

I'm less fluent in SQL by the day :-) I meant that an inner join would require a bugnote to exist, whereas the outer join would allow matching even if no matching bugnote entry exists. |

However in this case as I said before bugnote\_text and bugnote tables have a 1:1 relationship, i.e. there is (or should be) always one record in each table for a given note, except possibly in case of errors (in which case we'd likely have orphan records in bugnote\_text table). See bugnote\_add() lines 154 & 176.  It's worth noting that the same logic also applies to bug & bug\_text tables. |

Not sure if it is worth the work, but I always thought of this as extra complexity.  Agreed. And the same goes for bugnote vs bugnote\_text too. But this is no small undertaking, and definitely not on the critical path atm... Not to mention that it obviously involves a schema change, which means it has to be done in master branch, and we still have no plan or resources to get cracking on releasing that ;)  That said, I have updated both trackers with the fix now, so I'll make this issue public. |
