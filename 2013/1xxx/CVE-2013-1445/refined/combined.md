Subject: CVE-2013-1445 python-crypto: PRNG not correctly reseeded in some
 situations

In PyCrypto before v2.6.1, the Crypto.Random pseudo-random number
generator (PRNG) exhibits a race condition that may cause it to generate
the same 'random' output in multiple processes that are forked from each
other.  Depending on the application, this could reveal sensitive
information or cryptographic keys to remote attackers.

An application may be affected if, within 100 milliseconds, it performs
the following steps (which may be summarized as "read-fork-read-read"):

1. Read from the Crypto.Random PRNG, causing an internal reseed;
2. Fork the process and invoke Crypto.Random.atfork() in the child;
3. Read from the Crypto.Random PRNG again, in at least two different
     processes (parent and child, or multiple children).

Only applications that invoke Crypto.Random.atfork() and perform the
above steps are affected by this issue.  Other applications are
unaffected.

Note: Some PyCrypto functions, such as key generation and PKCS#1-related
functions, implicitly read from the Crypto.Random PRNG.

== Technical details ==

Crypto.Random uses Fortuna[1] to generate random numbers.  The flow of
entropy looks something like this:

      /dev/urandom  -\
                      +-> "accumulator" --> "generator" --> output
      other sources -/   (entropy pools)     (AES-CTR)

- The "accumulator" maintains several pools that collect entropy from
    the environment.

- The "generator" is a deterministic PRNG that is reseeded by the
    accumulator.  Reseeding normally occurs during each request for random
    numbers, but never more than once every 100 ms (the "minimum reseed
    interval").

When a process is forked, the parent's state is duplicated in the child.
In order to continue using the PRNG, the child process must invoke
Crypto.Random.atfork(), which collects new entropy from /dev/urandom and
adds it to the accumulator.  When new PRNG output is subsequently
requested, some of the new entropy in the accumulator is used to reseed
the generator, causing the output of the child to diverge from its
parent.

However, in previous versions of PyCrypto, Crypto.Random.atfork() did
not explicitly reset the child's rate-limiter, so if the child requested
PRNG output before the minimum reseed interval of 100 ms had elapsed, it
would generate its output using state inherited from its parent.

This created a race condition between the parent process and its forked
children that could cause them to produce identical PRNG output for the
duration of the 100 ms minimum reseed interval.

== Demonstration ==

Here is some sample code that illustrates the problem:

      from binascii import hexlify
      import multiprocessing, pprint, time
      import Crypto.Random

      def task_main(arg):
          a = Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(8)
          time.sleep(0.1)
          b = Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(8)
          rdy, ack = arg
          rdy.set()
          ack.wait()
          return "%s,%s" % (hexlify(a).decode(),
                            hexlify(b).decode())

      n_procs = 4
      manager = multiprocessing.Manager()
      rdys = [manager.Event() for i in range(n_procs)]
      acks = [manager.Event() for i in range(n_procs)]
      Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(1)
      pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=n_procs,
                                  initializer=Crypto.Random.atfork)
      res_async = pool.map_async(task_main, zip(rdys, acks))
      pool.close()
      [rdy.wait() for rdy in rdys]
      [ack.set() for ack in acks]
      res = res_async.get()
      pprint.pprint(sorted(res))
      pool.join()

The output should be random, but it looked like this:

      ['c607803ae01aa8c0,2e4de6457a304b34',
       'c607803ae01aa8c0,af80d08942b4c987',
       'c607803ae01aa8c0,b0e4c0853de927c4',
       'c607803ae01aa8c0,f0362585b3fceba4']

== Solution ==

The solution is to upgrade to PyCrypto v2.6.1 or later, which properly
resets the rate-limiter when Crypto.Random.atfork() is invoked in the
child.

== Files ==

PyCrypto v2.6.1 may be downloaded from the PyCrypto website[2], from
PyPI, or using your operating system's package manager or ports tree.

The official tarball has the following SHA256 sums:

f2ce1e989b272cfcb677616763e0a2e7ec659effa67a88aa92b3a65528f60a3c *pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz

2.6.1

## Description

The Crypto.Random.atfork function in PyCrypto before 2.6.1 does not properly reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a child process to access it, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a race condition in which a child process is created and accesses the PRNG within the same rate-limit period as another process.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

== Summary ==

In PyCrypto before v2.6.1, the Crypto.Random pseudo-random number
generator (PRNG) exhibits a race condition that may cause it to generate
the same 'random' output in multiple processes that are forked from each
other.  Depending on the application, this could reveal sensitive
information or cryptographic keys to remote attackers.

An application may be affected if, within 100 milliseconds, it performs
the following steps (which may be summarized as "read-fork-read-read"):

1. Read from the Crypto.Random PRNG, causing an internal reseed;
2. Fork the process and invoke Crypto.Random.atfork() in the child;
3. Read from the Crypto.Random PRNG again, in at least two different
   processes (parent and child, or multiple children).

Only applications that invoke Crypto.Random.atfork() and perform the
above steps are affected by this issue.  Other applications are
unaffected.

Note: Some PyCrypto functions, such as key generation and PKCS#1-related
functions, implicitly read from the Crypto.Random PRNG.

== Technical details ==

Crypto.Random uses Fortuna[1] to generate random numbers.  The flow of
entropy looks something like this:

    /dev/urandom  -\
                    +-> "accumulator" --> "generator" --> output
    other sources -/   (entropy pools)     (AES-CTR)

- The "accumulator" maintains several pools that collect entropy from
  the environment.

- The "generator" is a deterministic PRNG that is reseeded by the
  accumulator.  Reseeding normally occurs during each request for random
  numbers, but never more than once every 100 ms (the "minimum reseed
  interval").

When a process is forked, the parent's state is duplicated in the child.
In order to continue using the PRNG, the child process must invoke
Crypto.Random.atfork(), which collects new entropy from /dev/urandom and
adds it to the accumulator.  When new PRNG output is subsequently
requested, some of the new entropy in the accumulator is used to reseed
the generator, causing the output of the child to diverge from its
parent.

However, in previous versions of PyCrypto, Crypto.Random.atfork() did
not explicitly reset the child's rate-limiter, so if the child requested
PRNG output before the minimum reseed interval of 100 ms had elapsed, it
would generate its output using state inherited from its parent.

This created a race condition between the parent process and its forked
children that could cause them to produce identical PRNG output for the
duration of the 100 ms minimum reseed interval.

== Demonstration ==

Here is some sample code that illustrates the problem:

    from binascii import hexlify
    import multiprocessing, pprint, time
    import Crypto.Random

    def task_main(arg):
        a = Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(8)
        time.sleep(0.1)
        b = Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(8)
        rdy, ack = arg
        rdy.set()
        ack.wait()
        return "%s,%s" % (hexlify(a).decode(),
                          hexlify(b).decode())

    n_procs = 4
    manager = multiprocessing.Manager()
    rdys = [manager.Event() for i in range(n_procs)]
    acks = [manager.Event() for i in range(n_procs)]
    Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(1)
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=n_procs,
                                initializer=Crypto.Random.atfork)
    res_async = pool.map_async(task_main, zip(rdys, acks))
    pool.close()
    [rdy.wait() for rdy in rdys]
    [ack.set() for ack in acks]
    res = res_async.get()
    pprint.pprint(sorted(res))
    pool.join()

The output should be random, but it looked like this:

    ['c607803ae01aa8c0,2e4de6457a304b34',
     'c607803ae01aa8c0,af80d08942b4c987',
     'c607803ae01aa8c0,b0e4c0853de927c4',
     'c607803ae01aa8c0,f0362585b3fceba4']

== Solution ==

The solution is to upgrade to PyCrypto v2.6.1 or later, which properly
resets the rate-limiter when Crypto.Random.atfork() is invoked in the
child.

Package        : python-crypto
Vulnerability  : PRNG not correctly reseeded in some situations
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1445
Debian Bug     :

A cryptographic vulnerability was discovered in the pseudo random number
generator in python-crypto.

In some situations, a race condition could prevent the reseeding of the
generator when multiple processes are forked from the same parent. This would
lead it to generate identical output on all processes, which might leak
sensitive values like cryptographic keys.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-2+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-4+deb7u3.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.1-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-crypto packages.
