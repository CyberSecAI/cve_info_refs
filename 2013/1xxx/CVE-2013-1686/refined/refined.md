{
  "CVE-2013-1686": {
    "Description": "Heap-use-after-free in mozilla::ResetDir",
    "Root cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the `mozilla::ResetDir` function when handling the `dir=auto` HTML attribute. The vulnerability stems from a race condition where a text node is freed while still being referenced within a directionality map, leading to a use-after-free when accessing that freed memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By opening a specially crafted HTML page with the `dir=auto` attribute set, an attacker could trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to trick a user into opening a malicious website or email. No special privileges or access to the local system is required."
