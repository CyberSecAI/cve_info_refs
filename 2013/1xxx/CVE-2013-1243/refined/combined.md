Details  * **Cisco IPS Software Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability**      The Cisco IPS is a family of network security devices that provide network-based threat prevention services. Cisco IPS Software includes several applications that are used by the system to run different tasks. In particular, the *MainApp* process is responsible for multiple critical tasks including reading the configuration, starting and stopping applications and authentication service.      Additional information about the *MainApp* process is in the "System Architecture" section of the product configuration guide:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/ips/7.1/configuration/guide/idm/idm_system_architecture.html#wp1126061>      A vulnerability in the IP stack could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the *MainApp* process to become unresponsive. This creates a denial of service (DoS) condition because the Cisco IPS sensor is not able to execute several critical tasks including alert notification, event store management, and sensor authentication. The Cisco IPS web server will also be unavailable while the *MainApp* process is unresponsive. Additionally, due to this general system failure, other processes such as the *Analysis Engine* may not work properly. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of malformed IP packets from the management interface of the affected system. An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IP packets to the management interface.      The vulnerability can be triggered only by IPv4 traffic directed to the management interface. Traffic passing through the sensing interfaces will not trigger this vulnerability. If the Cisco IPS is configured in promiscuous mode, mitigation actions that require *MainApp* processing such as **shun** or **rate-limit** may be unavailable. If the Cisco IPS is configured in inline mode, the sensor may not correctly perform inspection and mitigation actions because the *Analysis Engine* process may not be working properly.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtx18596](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx18596) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1243.      **Cisco IPS Software Fragmented Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco IPS SSP is an integrated module running on Cisco ASA 5500-X Series. The module could be deployed in hardware for the Cisco ASA 5585-X, or as an integrated software module for the Cisco ASA 5512-X, Cisco ASA 5515-X, Cisco ASA 5525-X, Cisco ASA 5545-X, and Cisco ASA 5555-X Series.      Cisco IPS Software running on the ASA 5500-X IPS SSP processes only traffic that it receives from the Cisco ASA. Cisco ASA needs to be configured with Modular Policy Framework (MPF) to redirect specific traffic to the Cisco IPS Software.      A vulnerability in the implementation of the code that processes fragmented traffic could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the *Analysis Engine* process to become unresponsive or cause the affected system to reload.      The vulnerability is due to improper handling of fragmented IP packets sent from the Cisco ASA data plane to the Cisco IPS processor for inspection and processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a combination of fragmented and other IP packets through the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or cause the *Analysis Engine* process to become unresponsive. When the *Analysis Engine* process is unresponsive, the affected system will not process traffic, which will cause that traffic to be dropped. Additionally, if the Cisco ASA with a Cisco IPS SSP software module running an   affected version of software is configured in High-Availability mode (HA), a failover event may be triggered when the Cisco IPS SSP reloads or stops forwarding traffic.      The vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 fragmented packets passing through the affected system. Traffic directed to the management IP address of the Cisco IPS software module will not trigger this vulnerability.      **Note:** This vulnerability affects only the Cisco ASA 5500-X Series IPS SSP software module. Cisco IPS SSP hardware modules supported on the Cisco ASA5585-X Series are not affected by this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue51272](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue51272) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1218.      **Cisco IPS NME Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the memory allocation code could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of memory allocation when malformed IP packets are received on the management interface of the affected system. An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IP packets to the management IP address.      The vulnerability can be triggered only by IPv4 traffic directed to the management interface. Traffic passing through the sensing interfaces will not trigger this vulnerability.      This vulnerability affects only Cisco IPS Software running on Cisco IPS NME.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCua61977](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua61977) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3410.      **Cisco IDSM-2 Malformed TCP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the IDSM-2 drivers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the system kernel to become unresponsive. This creates a denial of service (DoS) condition because the Cisco IPS sensor is not able to execute several critical tasks, including alert notification, event store management, sensor authentication, and traffic inspection. The Cisco IPS web server will also be unavailable.      The vulnerability is due to improper handling of malformed TCP packets from the management interface of the affected system. An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IP packets to the management interface. A TCP three-way handshake is not required to exploit this vulnerability. A hard system reboot is needed to restore the functionality of the system.      The vulnerability can be triggered only by IPv4 traffic directed to the management interface. Traffic passing through the sensing interfaces will not trigger this vulnerability.      This vulnerability affects only Cisco IPS Software running on Cisco IDSM-2 Module.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh27460](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh27460) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3411.  Workarounds  * **Cisco IPS Software Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability and Cisco IPS NME Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability**      There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.      **Cisco IPS Software Fragmented Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability**      If an exploit of this vulnerability is causing traffic interruption, administrators can remove the Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the Cisco ASA that is used to direct the user traffic toward the Cisco IPS SSP. This change will cause all user traffic to bypass Cisco IPS SSP module inspection and allow it to pass through the Cisco ASA.      The following example shows how to disable the redirecting of web traffic to the Cisco IPS Software module from the Cisco ASA firewall: ```   ASA(config)# class-map ips_trafficASA(config-cmap)# match anyASA(config)# policy-map ips_traffic_policyASA(config-pmap)# class ips_trafficASA(config-pmap-c)# no ips inline|promiscious   ``` **Note:** Configuring IPS bypass with the command **fail-open** or **fail-close** will not have any effect on the Cisco IPS software module for the Cisco ASA.      If the IPS is running in promiscuous mode, as a mitigation, fragmented traffic can be disabled for IPS processing.      The following example shows how to disable fragmented traffic on the Cisco IPS software module: ```   sensor# conf tsensor(config)# ser sig sig0sensor(config-sig)# sig 1200 0sensor(config-sig-sig)# engine normalizer sensor(config-sig-sig-nor)# edit-default-sigs-only default-signatures-only sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def)# specify-max-fragments yessensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def-yes)# max-fragments 0sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def-yes)# exitsensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def)# exitsensor(config-sig-sig-nor)# exitsensor(config-sig-sig)# exitsensor(config-sig)# exit   Apply Changes?[yes]: yes   ``` This change requires a Cisco IPS software module reload.      **Note:** This change will cause all non-TCP fragments to pass uninspected.      Alternatively, fragmented traffic can be disallowed on the Cisco ASA firewall. This will cause the Cisco ASA firewall not to accept any fragments on its interfaces. Consequently, the Cisco ASA will not send any fragments to the Cisco IPS software module for inspection.      The following example shows how to disable fragmented traffic on the Cisco ASA firewall: ```   ASA(config)# fragment chain 1    ``` **Note:** The preceding example will disable fragments on all the Cisco ASA interfaces.      **Cisco IDSM-2 Malformed TCP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability**      There is no workaround for this vulnerability however, the Cisco IDSM-2 Module administrator should make sure to limit the number of hosts (IP addresses) allowed to connect to the management interface of system.      To restrict the number of allowed hosts, the administrator should use the **access-list** command. The **no access-list** command should be used to remove any hosts or networks from the list.   The following example shows the sequence of commands to remove the access to the full 192.168.1.0/24 network and allow access only to the host with IP address 192.168.1.1:   + Use the **show settings** command in network-setting configuration mode to see the current allowed hosts or networks. The following example shows that the Cisco IDSM-2 is configured to allow all the hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network ```   sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings   network-settings   -----------------------------------------------      [...]      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)      -----------------------------------------------         network-address: 192.168.1.0/24         -----------------------------------------------      -----------------------------------------------      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds       login-banner-text:       [...]   ```    + Use the **access-list** command in network-setting configuration mode, to add the 192.168.1.1 hosts. Make sure that if this is the only allowed host, it is also the one from which you are executing the configuration to avoid losing connectivity to the Cisco IDSM-2 Module. ```   sensor(config-hos-net)#access-list 192.168.1.1/32   ```    + Use the **no access-list** command in network-setting configuration mode, to remove the 192.168.1.0/32 network for the allowed hosts list. ```   sensor(config-hos-net)#no access-list 192.168.1.0/24   ```    + Use the **show setting** command in network-setting configuration mode to check that the list of allowed hosts is correct: ```   sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings   network-settings   -----------------------------------------------      [...]      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)      -----------------------------------------------         network-address: 192.168.1.1/32         -----------------------------------------------      -----------------------------------------------      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds       login-banner-text:       [...]   ```    + Exit and apply the configuration: ```   sensor(config-hos-net)# exitsensor(config-hos)# exitApply Changes:?[yes]:    ``` **Note:** Internal tests performed by Cisco have shown that this vulnerability cannot be exploited if the total number of hosts allowed is less than or equal to 254 hosts. Administrators who cannot reduce the number of allowed hosts to the number indicated in this advisory should contact Cisco Technical Assistance Center for additional support.

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  **Access Vector**  ---   Local (L) A vulnerability exploitable with only local access requires the attacker to have either physical access to the vulnerable system or a local (shell) account. Examples of locally exploitable vulnerabilities are peripheral attacks such as Firewire/USB DMA attacks, and local privilege escalations (e.g., sudo). Adjacent Network (A) A vulnerability exploitable with adjacent network access requires the attacker to have access to either the broadcast or collision domain of the vulnerable software. Examples of local networks include local IP subnet, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, and local Ethernet segment.  Network (N) A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". An example of a network attack is an RPC buffer overflow.  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  **Access Complexity**  ---   High (H)  Specialized access conditions exist. For example: In most configurations, the attacking party must already have elevated privileges or spoof additional systems in addition to the attacking system (e.g., DNS hijacking). The attack depends on social engineering methods that would be easily detected by knowledgeable people. For example, the victim must perform several suspicious or atypical actions. The vulnerable configuration is seen very rarely in practice. If a race condition exists, the window is very narrow. Medium (M)  The access conditions are somewhat specialized; the following are examples: The attacking party is limited to a group of systems or users at some level of authorization, possibly untrusted. Some information must be gathered before a successful attack can be launched. The affected configuration is non-default, and is not commonly configured (e.g., a vulnerability present when a server performs user account authentication via a specific scheme, but not present for another authentication scheme). The attack requires a small amount of social engineering that might occasionally fool cautious users (e.g., phishing attacks that modify a web browser?s status bar to show a false link, having to be on someone?s ?buddy? list before sending an IM exploit).  Low (L)  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. The following are examples: The affected product typically requires access to a wide range of systems and users, possibly anonymous and untrusted (e.g., Internet-facing web or mail server). The affected configuration is default or ubiquitous. The attack can be performed manually and requires little skill or additional information gathering. The ?race condition? is a lazy one (i.e., it is technically a race but easily winnable).  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  **Authentication**  ---   Multiple (M) Exploiting the vulnerability requires that the attacker authenticate two or more times, even if the same credentials are used each time. An example is an attacker authenticating to an operating system in addition to providing credentials to access an application hosted on that system. Single (S) The vulnerability requires an attacker to be logged into the system (such as at a command line or via a desktop session or web interface).  None (N) Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  **Confidentiality Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. Partial (P) There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. An example is a vulnerability that divulges only certain tables in a database.  Complete (C) There is total information disclosure, resulting in all system files being revealed. The attacker is able to read all of the system's data (memory, files, etc.)  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  **Integrity Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the integrity of the system. Partial (P) Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. For example, system or application files may be overwritten or modified, but either the attacker has no control over which files are affected or the attacker can modify files within only a limited context or scope.  Complete (C) There is a total compromise of system integrity. There is a complete loss of system protection, resulting in the entire system being compromised. The attacker is able to modify any files on the target system.  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete  **Availability Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the availability of the system. Partial (P)There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. An example is a network-based flood attack that permits a limited number of successful connections to an Internet service.  Complete (C) There is a total shutdown of the affected resource. The attacker can render the resource completely unavailable.    Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   **Collateral Damage Potential**  ---   None (N) There is no potential for loss of life, physical assets, productivity or revenue. Low (L) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in slight physical or property damage. Or, there may be a slight loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.  Low-Medium (LM) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in moderate physical or property damage. Or, there may be a moderate loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.  Medium-High (MH) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in significant physical or property damage or loss. Or, there may be a significant loss of revenue or productivity.  High (H) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in catastrophic physical or property damage and loss. Or, there may be a catastrophic loss of revenue or productivity.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   **Target Distribution**  ---   None (N) No target systems exist, or targets are so highly specialized that they only exist in a laboratory setting. Effectively 0% of the environment is at risk. Low (L) Targets exist inside the environment, but on a small scale. Between 1% - 25% of the total environment is at risk.  Medium (M) Targets exist inside the environment, but on a medium scale. Between 26% - 75% of the total environment is at risk.  High (H) Targets exist inside the environment on a considerable scale. Between 76% - 100% of the total environment is considered at risk.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   **Confidentiality Requirement**  ---   Low (L): Loss of confidentiality is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers). Medium (M): Loss of confidentiality is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  High (H): Loss of confidentiality is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  Not Defined (ND): Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   **Integrity Requirement**  ---   Low (L): Loss of integrity is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers). Medium (M): Loss of integrity is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  High (H): Loss of integrity is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  Not Defined (ND): Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High   **Availability Requirement**  ---   Low (L): Loss of availability is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers). Medium (M): Loss of availability is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  High (H): Loss of availability is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).
