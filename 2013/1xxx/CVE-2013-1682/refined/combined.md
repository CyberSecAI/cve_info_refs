Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1682 CVE-2013-1684 CVE-2013-1685 CVE-2013-1686
                 CVE-2013-1687 CVE-2013-1690 CVE-2013-1692 CVE-2013-1693
                 CVE-2013-1694 CVE-2013-1697

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-free vulnerabilities, missing permission checks, incorrect
memory handling and other implementaton errors may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, information disclosure or
cross-site request forgery.

The iceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no
longer supported with security updates.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.7esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.7esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0981)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2013-1682, CVE-2013-1684, CVE-2013-1685, CVE-2013-1686,
CVE-2013-1687, CVE-2013-1690)

It was found that Firefox allowed data to be sent in the body of
XMLHttpRequest (XHR) HEAD requests. In some cases this could allow
attackers to conduct Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
(CVE-2013-1692)

Timing differences in the way Firefox processed SVG image files could
allow an attacker to read data across domains, potentially leading to
information disclosure. (CVE-2013-1693)

Two flaws were found in the way Firefox implemented some of its internal
structures (called wrappers). An attacker could use these flaws to bypass
some restrictions placed on them. This could lead to unexpected behavior or
a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2013-1694, CVE-2013-1697)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight,
Abhishek Arya, Mariusz Mlynski, Nils, Johnathan Kuskos, Paul Stone, Boris
Zbarsky, and moz\_bug\_r\_a4 as the original reporters of these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla
security advisories for Firefox 17.0.7 ESR. You can find a link to the
Mozilla advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 17.0.7 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=977597#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-06-25 01:48:32 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts. Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, and Andrew McCreight reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 17, and Firefox 21.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2013/mfsa2013-49.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, and Andrew McCreight as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=977597#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-25 20:02:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:0982 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0982.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=977597#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-25 20:12:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0981 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0981.html>   ``` |  |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-49

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:22.0 / rv:17.0.7)

Announced
June 25, 2013
Reporter
Mozilla Developers
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 22
* Firefox ESR 17.0.7
* SeaMonkey 2.19
* Thunderbird 17.0.7
* Thunderbird ESR 17.0.7

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we
presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.

### References

problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 17, and Firefox

I came across this stack report:
<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/c8be7cc5-f067-4ec6-9eec-34bac2130112>
I'm not sure what the real problem is here, but the immediate problem appears to be that js\_ValueToSource turns a value into an object, then runs code on it without entering the compartment.

That looks okay to me, but you should get a review from somebody who is more familiar with this part of the code.

This seems wrong to me. Ideally, we would have an assertion at the top of js\_ValueToSource to ensure that v is in the cx->compartment compartment. I suspect that that assertion would fire instead, although maybe not. However, we shouldn't need to enter any compartments in this code, since it should all be same-compartment.
Maybe we should add that assertion and see what happens to these crashes.

That's a different stack. It doesn't have js\_ValueToSource or js::ReportIsNotFunction anywhere in it. I've only seen this crash a single time, so it may make sense to just mark this bug incomplete, given that it seems like garbage floating in from elsewhere.

This happened again. The stack is similar, though the error was triggered inside JS\_CloneFunctionObject instead. I don't know if this needs to be sec-critical given that it only seems to happen every few months, but it would be nice to understand why this is happening.
As you might expect, the assertion at the top of the function fires immediately, instead of later at the invoke.
Does RootedValue not check that the value is in the right compartment?
This error code could also be changed to just always do a runtime abort when it detects compartment problems, or bail or or something.

Attached patch

[enter compartment before calling ReportNotFunction](attachment.cgi?id=732620&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=732620&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=830389&attachment=732620)

I think the problem here is that JS\_CloneFunctionObject can handle functions from different comparments. Most of the function handles it correctly, but in the error case that the argument is a function, it fails to enter the compartment before invoking ReportIsNotFunction.

Btw, if this ValueToSource assertion reoccurs, I think a new bug should be filed, since it's likely a different underlying issue.

The patch looks safe and simple but it will be very helpful if you can please call out the risk explicitly, given we are in our last beta and very close to release and do not want to induce scope for any new regressions at this point in the 21 cycle?Thanks.

I think it's about as safe a patch as you can get. It only has effect in an uncommon error case.

I discussed this offline with :dveditz and the only reason I was considering this for final beta was due to [comment #16](/show_bug.cgi?id=830389#c16 "RESOLVED FIXED - compartment mismatch in js_ValueToSource inside js::ReportIsNotFunction").But based on my recent conversation I am only going to approve this for aurora at this time as we typically do not tend to take patches in our final beta if not necessary.In addition to this being a very old bug as esr 17 is affected,it is our understanding that the bug comments or the code that is being checked-in do not paint a bull's eye in the security problem which otherwise could be a strong driver to take into beta .
Please feel free to renominate if there is a disagreement here and make sure to nominate such bugs for sec-approval before landing.Thanks!

# USN-1890-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

26 June 2013

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1682](/security/CVE-2013-1682), [CVE-2013-1683](/security/CVE-2013-1683))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free bugs. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit these to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1684](/security/CVE-2013-1684), [CVE-2013-1685](/security/CVE-2013-1685), [CVE-2013-1686](/security/CVE-2013-1686))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that user defined code within the XBL scope of

an element could be made to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW). An attacker

could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1687](/security/CVE-2013-1687))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the profiler user interface incorrectly

handled data from the profiler. If the user examined profiler output

on a specially crafted page, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2013-1688](/security/CVE-2013-1688))

A crash was discovered when reloading a page that contained content using

the onreadystatechange event. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox

([CVE-2013-1690](/security/CVE-2013-1690))

Johnathan Kuskos discovered that Firefox sent data in the body of

XMLHttpRequest HEAD requests. An attacker could exploit this to conduct

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. ([CVE-2013-1692](/security/CVE-2013-1692))

Paul Stone discovered a timing flaw in the processing of SVG images with

filters. An attacker could exploit this to view sensitive information.

([CVE-2013-1693](/security/CVE-2013-1693))

Boris Zbarsky discovered a flaw in PreserveWrapper. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2013-1694](/security/CVE-2013-1694))

Bob Owen discovered that a sandboxed iframe could use a frame element

to bypass its own restrictions. ([CVE-2013-1695](/security/CVE-2013-1695))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header is ignored

in multi-part responses. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2013-1696](/security/CVE-2013-1696))

It was discovered that XrayWrappers could be bypassed to call

content-defined methods in certain circumstances. An attacker could

exploit this to cause undefined behaviour. ([CVE-2013-1697](/security/CVE-2013-1697))

Matt Wobensmith discovered that the getUserMedia permission dialog

displayed the wrong domain in certain circumstances. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to trick the user in to giving a malicious

site access to their microphone or camera. ([CVE-2013-1698](/security/CVE-2013-1698))

It was discovered that the measures for preventing homograph attacks

using Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) were not sufficient

for certain Top Level Domains (TLD). An attacker could potentially

exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and phishing attacks.

([CVE-2013-1699](/security/CVE-2013-1699))

  * Remove obsolete patches
    - remove debian/patches/fix-makefile-substitution-bug.patch

  * Testpilot has been removed from Firefox
    - update debian/firefox.install.in
  * Run the xpcshell binary from the actual install directory rather than
    the temporary test directory, as some tests assume this now (eg, the
    distribution/ directory is assumed to be in the same directory as
    xpcshell). This means we also have to install httpd.js et al in to
    the actual components/ directory, as the upstream test harness assumes
    this too. This fixes test_ubuntu_searchplugins.js test failures since
    the distribution/ directory was moved back up a level on disk
    - update debian/build/rules.mk
    - update debian/firefox-testsuite.install.in
    - update debian/firefox.install.in
    - update debian/testing/run_xpcshell_tests
    - update debian/testing/testrunhelper.py
  * Make "make check" failures non-fatal on armhf. I don't think anybody
    actually genuinely cares whether Firefox works there or not, so don't
    let it block migration from proposed
    - update debian/build/testsuite.mk

###!!! ASSERTION: Trying to compute style without PresShell: 'presShell', file /Users/jruderman/trees/mozilla-central/editor/libeditor/html/nsHTMLCSSUtils.cpp, line 592
###!!! ASSERTION: wrong shell: '!doc || doc->GetShell() == this', file /Users/jruderman/trees/mozilla-central/layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp, line 6582
The "wrong shell" assertion was added in a security bug ([bug 635852](/show_bug.cgi?id=635852 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate if PresShell::GetCurrentEventFrame() should check that mCurrentEventContent's ownerDoc == mDocument")).
I'm guessing this will be fixed by not allowing selections to be in other documents. That's part of the plan in [bug 671152](/show_bug.cgi?id=671152 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - ASSERTION: null node passed to IsTextNode() + ASSERTION: selection could not be collapsed after undo of deletetext.") and [bug 768756](/show_bug.cgi?id=768756 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: IsCSSEquivalentToHTMLInlineStyleSet failed\" with parent document's selection in a removed iframe"), right?

[Bug 671152](/show_bug.cgi?id=671152 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - ASSERTION: null node passed to IsTextNode() + ASSERTION: selection could not be collapsed after undo of deletetext.") should be fixed, but that isn't something for branches.
So perhaps we should just add a simple if check for this case.
Mats, what do you think?

Yes, this is a good precaution. It's still caused by bug(s) in our code
though so I'd like to keep the assertions in PresShell, so please add the
NS\_ENSURE\_STATE after the DEBUG block. r=mats

Fwiw, I wonder if we could something like this to reject nodes not in
the same document as the Selection owner. It would throw ERROR\_FAILURE
which is probably wrong -- WRONG\_DOCUMENT seems more appropriate.
BTW, is this the authoritative spec for selectAllChildren ?

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No really
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All, and looks like [Bug 635852](/show_bug.cgi?id=635852 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate if PresShell::GetCurrentEventFrame() should check that mCurrentEventContent's ownerDoc == mDocument") landed everywhere so this patch could also.
The bug itself is old, not a recent regression.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The patch should apply everywhere.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Should be reasonable safe, but not risk free. Some testing is needed.

I was thinking something similar but I think we just need [bug 671152](/show_bug.cgi?id=671152 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - ASSERTION: null node passed to IsTextNode() + ASSERTION: selection could not be collapsed after undo of deletetext.") fixed, and make sure the
spec is sane.

It's the only spec I know of, but I sure wouldn't view it as authoritative. More like, some research went into it and it's a good starting point for discussion.

I tested this fix on Mac OSX 10.7 with Firefox 22 beta 2 debug and the testcase in this bug.
The first assertion in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=862309#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: Trying to compute style without PresShell\" with editor, cross-document selection") has disappeared, but the second one is still there, just on another line:
###!!! ASSERTION: wrong shell: '!doc || doc->GetShell() == this', file ../../../layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp, line 6604.
Would you rather I filed a followup bug for that, or just reopen this one?

That second one is there on purpose. See [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=862309#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: Trying to compute style without PresShell\" with editor, cross-document selection").
But we'll need to fix the code to not trigger that assertion.

CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1682 CVE-2013-1684 CVE-2013-1685 CVE-2013-1686

                 CVE-2013-1694 CVE-2013-1697

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client. Multiple memory safety
errors, use-after-free vulnerabilities, missing permission checks, incorrect
memory handling and other implementaton errors may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, information disclosure or
cross-site request forgery.

As already announced for Iceweasel: We're changing the approach for
security updates for Icedove in stable-security: Instead of
backporting security fixes, we now provide releases based on the
Extended Support Release branch. As such, this update introduces
packages based on Thunderbird 17 and at some point in the future we
will switch to the next ESR branch once ESR 17 has reached it's end
of life.

Some Icedove extensions currently packaged in the Debian archive are
not compatible with the new browser engine. Up-to-date and compatible
versions can be retrieved from <http://addons.mozilla.org> as a short
term solution.

An updated and compatible version of enigmail is included with this
update.

The icedove version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no
longer supported with full security updates. However, it should be
noted that almost all security issues in Icedove stem from the
included browser engine. These security problems only affect Icedove
if scripting and HTML mails are enabled. If there are security issues
specific to Icedove (e.g. a hypothetical buffer overflow in the IMAP
implementation) we'll make an effort to backport such fixes to oldstable.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.7-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If the user

were tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting

enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1682](/security/CVE-2013-1682))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free bugs. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,

an attacker could possibly exploit these to execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1684](/security/CVE-2013-1684),

[CVE-2013-1685](/security/CVE-2013-1685), [CVE-2013-1686](/security/CVE-2013-1686))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that user defined code within the XBL scope of

an element could be made to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user

had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1687](/security/CVE-2013-1687))

A crash was discovered when reloading a page that contained content using

the onreadystatechange event. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1690](/security/CVE-2013-1690))

Johnathan Kuskos discovered that Thunderbird sent data in the body of

XMLHttpRequest HEAD requests. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker

could exploit this to conduct Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

([CVE-2013-1692](/security/CVE-2013-1692))

Paul Stone discovered a timing flaw in the processing of SVG images with

filters. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could exploit this

to view sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-1693](/security/CVE-2013-1693))

Boris Zbarsky discovered a flaw in PreserveWrapper. If a user had

scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash, or execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1694](/security/CVE-2013-1694))

It was discovered that XrayWrappers could be bypassed to call

content-defined methods in certain circumstances. If a user had scripting

enabled, an attacker could exploit this to cause undefined behaviour.

([CVE-2013-1697](/security/CVE-2013-1697))

s-s because scary memory address 0xfffb7fffffffffff is being accessed.
This requires --no-baseline, and occurs when --no-baseline was first added as a shell flag, so autoBisect is unable to get an accurate bisection.
The following variant does not crash js opt shell but asserts js debug shell at Assertion failure: !val.isMagic(), at jsobj.cpp :

JM bug but IonMonkey has the same problem. When we inline arr1.concat(arr2), the result array will have arr1's type. The problem is that if arr1 is known to be packed, and arr2 is not packed, the result may not be packed but its TypeObject will say it is.
I can reproduce this crash on mozilla-beta too, so it's likely an old bug.Assignee: general → jdemooijStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Patch
I \*think\* this is a (near-)NULL-dereference worst-case, and therefore not exploitable, but probably best to treat as critical just to be sure.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Not trivial, but shouldn't be too hard, especially with some fuzzing help.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? There are comments but somebody reading the code would basically get the same info.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? Release, aurora, beta.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? Unknown, pretty sure it's an old bug.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? Should apply cleanly, or else very easy to backport.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? Unlikely.

Jandem,just wanted to make sure the patch is extremely safe & low risk enough to take into our final beta ? or should be reconsider the landing here based on [comment# 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=867482#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ js::types::Type::ObjectType] or [@ GetValueType] or Assertion failure: !val.isMagic(), at jsobj.cpp") which informs it may not be exploitable and this is already out there is Release.

ESR doesn't have IonMonkey and b2g18 has it turned off, but do we need the methodjit part of this patch on those older branches?

Attached patch

[Patch for esr17 and b2g18](attachment.cgi?id=747079&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=747079&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=867482&attachment=747079)

I couldn't reproduce the crash on esr17/b2g18 with the tests in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=867482#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ js::types::Type::ObjectType] or [@ GetValueType] or Assertion failure: !val.isMagic(), at jsobj.cpp"), because forEach is not self-hosted there.
The test below crashes esr17/b2g18 though with -m -n -a and I verified this patch fixes the crash.
function ArrayForEach(callbackfn ) {
var O = this;
var len = (O.length >>> 0);
for (var k = 0; k < len; k++) {
if (k in O)
O[k].toString();
}
}
try {
x = []
x.length = 7
Object.defineProperty(this, "y", {
get: function() {
return ([]).concat(x)
}
})
Array.prototype.unshift.call(x, x)
} catch (e) {}
y[8]
ArrayForEach.call(y, Array.indexOf)

It turns out this bug is responsible for a topcrasher on Outlook.com with certain email accounts ([bug 851934](/show_bug.cgi?id=851934 "VERIFIED FIXED - crash in js::mjit::stubs::ValueToBoolean on Outlook.com")). Whether the browser crashes or not depends on your contact list; Firefox becomes unusable if you happen to have a "bad" Outlook.com account (it will crash every time you reply to an email etc).
So considering this bug affects real-world websites and causes top crashes, do we want to revisit our decision to not land this on beta? The patch is small and pretty safe (it disables an optimization in some cases), has been on m-c for more than a week and has been confirmed to fix the bug ([bug 851934 comment 59](/show_bug.cgi?id=851934#c59 "VERIFIED FIXED - crash in js::mjit::stubs::ValueToBoolean on Outlook.com")).

Well, we already have built the final 21.0 beta and release builds (modulo any extremely-high issues we'd do a last-minute respin for).
A week ago, there would have been some wiggle room for a high-value fix (as this is on the condition of fixing [bug 851934](/show_bug.cgi?id=851934 "VERIFIED FIXED - crash in js::mjit::stubs::ValueToBoolean on Outlook.com")), but now we're probably past that.
Though this is also a sec-crit, so if the worst case happens, it's exploitable, the aurora patch enables people to paint a bulls-eye on the problem and notice it via outlook.com crashing, we could end up with a 0-day and chemspill - so that eventuality (next to the high-volume crasher) might still give it some leverage for taking in a respin.

Oh, on the sec-crit status - I just looked into a few crashes from [bug 851934](/show_bug.cgi?id=851934 "VERIFIED FIXED - crash in js::mjit::stubs::ValueToBoolean on Outlook.com") and on all of them the breakpad tool gives them an exploitability rating of "none" so the automatic analysis says those (probably) can't be exploited.

No it's not sec-critical.

Hrm, given we may not have any more beta's for Fx21, is this safe enough to land on release-branch directly ? This means we will not get any beta testing and will be landing our fix directly for release audience.How confident are we that we will see no fallout's once this lands on Fx21 code ?
For everyone's context ,the reason that we did not take this in last beta was because we did not know that it had any relation to the top-crasher & based on discussion in [comment #7](/show_bug.cgi?id=867482#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ js::types::Type::ObjectType] or [@ GetValueType] or Assertion failure: !val.isMagic(), at jsobj.cpp") .

I'm very confident, also because this has been on m-c for over a week without any problems. As with any code change it's hard to be 100% sure though, but considering it fixes the crash it's probably worth it..Flags: needinfo?(jdemooij)

Thanks Jandem. I discussed this with Alex and both us believe that this fix needs to be on a beta and not something we can take on release directly.So although this is really worthy, it is just too late for Fx21.0 keeping in mind the general risk of regression with code change and to avoid surprises directly in our release build.

An update that fixes 9 vulnerabilities is now available. It
includes one version update.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox has been updated to the 17.0.7 ESR version,
which fixes bugs and security fixes.
\*
MFSA 2013-49: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, and Andrew McCreight
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 17, and Firefox 21. (CVE-2013-1682)
\*
MFSA 2013-50: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series of
use-after-free problems rated critical as security issues
in shipped software. Some of these issues are potentially
exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We would
also like to thank Abhishek for reporting additional
use-after-free and buffer overflow flaws in code introduced
during Firefox development. These were fixed before general
release.
o Heap-use-after-free in
mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::LookupMediaElementURITable
(CVE-2013-1684) o Heap-use-after-free in
nsIDocument::GetRootElement (CVE-2013-1685) o
Heap-use-after-free in mozilla::ResetDir (CVE-2013-1686)
\*
MFSA 2013-51 / CVE-2013-1687: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that it is possible to compile a
user-defined function in the XBL scope of a specific
element and then trigger an event within this scope to run
code. In some circumstances, when this code is run, it can
access content protected by System Only Wrappers (SOW) and
chrome-privileged pages. This could potentially lead to
arbitrary code execution. Additionally, Chrome Object
Wrappers (COW) can be bypassed by web content to access
privileged methods, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack from privileged pages.
\*
MFSA 2013-53 / CVE-2013-1690: Security researcher
Nils reported that specially crafted web content using the
onreadystatechange event and reloading of pages could
sometimes cause a crash when unmapped memory is executed.
This crash is potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-54 / CVE-2013-1692: Security researcher
Johnathan Kuskos reported that Firefox is sending data in
the body of XMLHttpRequest (XHR) HEAD requests, which goes
agains the XHR specification. This can potentially be used
for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks against sites
which do not distinguish between HEAD and POST requests.
\*
MFSA 2013-55 / CVE-2013-1693: Security researcher
Paul Stone of Context Information Security discovered that
timing differences in the processing of SVG format images
with filters could allow for pixel values to be read. This
could potentially allow for text values to be read across
domains, leading to information disclosure.
\*
MFSA 2013-59 / CVE-2013-1697: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that XrayWrappers can be
bypassed to call content-defined toString and valueOf
methods through DefaultValue. This can lead to unexpected
behavior when privileged code acts on the incorrect values.
\*
MFSA 2013-30: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
Olli Pettay, Jesse Ruderman, Boris Zbarsky, Christian
Holler, Milan Sreckovic, and Joe Drew reported memory
safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 17, and
Firefox 19. (CVE-2013-0788)
\*
MFSA 2013-31 / CVE-2013-0800: Security researcher
Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team
used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover an
out-of-bounds write in Cairo graphics library. When certain
values are passed to it during rendering, Cairo attempts to
use negative boundaries or sizes for boxes, leading to a
potentially exploitable crash in some instances.
\*
MFSA 2013-32 / CVE-2013-0799: Security researcher
Frederic Hoguin discovered that the Mozilla Maintenance
Service on Windows was vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
This system is used to update software without invoking the
User Account Control (UAC) prompt. The Mozilla Maintenance
Service is configured to allow unprivileged users to start
it with arbitrary arguments. By manipulating the data
passed in these arguments, an attacker can execute
arbitrary code with the system privileges used by the
service. This issue requires local file system access to be
exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-34 / CVE-2013-0797: Security researcher Ash
reported an issue with the Mozilla Updater. The Mozilla
Updater can be made to load a malicious local DLL file in a
privileged context through either the Mozilla Maintenance
Service or independently on systems that do not use the
service. This occurs when the DLL file is placed in a
specific location on the local system before the Mozilla
Updater is run. Local file system access is necessary in
order for this issue to be exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-35 / CVE-2013-0796: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a crash
in WebGL rendering when memory is freed that has not
previously been allocated. This issue only affects Linux
users who have Intel Mesa graphics drivers. The resulting
crash could be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-36 / CVE-2013-0795: Security researcher
Cody Crews reported a mechanism to use the cloneNode method
to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW) and clone a protected
node. This allows violation of the browser's same origin
policy and could also lead to privilege escalation and the
execution of arbitrary code.
\*
MFSA 2013-37 / CVE-2013-0794: Security researcher
shutdown reported a method for removing the origin
indication on tab-modal dialog boxes in combination with
browser navigation. This could allow an attacker's dialog
to overlay a page and show another site's content. This can
be used for phishing by allowing users to enter data into a
modal prompt dialog on an attacking, site while appearing
to be from the displayed site.
\*
MFSA 2013-38 / CVE-2013-0793: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported a method to use browser
navigations through history to load an arbitrary website
with that page's baseURI property pointing to another site
instead of the seemingly loaded one. The user will continue
to see the incorrect site in the addressbar of the browser.
This allows for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or the
theft of data through a phishing attack.
\*
MFSA 2013-39 / CVE-2013-0792: Mozilla community
member Tobias Schula reported that if
gfx.color\_management.enablev4 preference is enabled
manually in about:config, some grayscale PNG images will be
rendered incorrectly and cause memory corruption during PNG
decoding when certain color profiles are in use. A crafted
PNG image could use this flaw to leak data through rendered
images drawing from random memory. By default, this
preference is not enabled.
\*
MFSA 2013-40 / CVE-2013-0791: Mozilla community
member Ambroz Bizjak reported an out-of-bounds array read
in the CERT\_DecodeCertPackage function of the Network
Security Services (NSS) libary when decoding a certificate.
When this occurs, it will lead to memory corruption and a
non-exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2013-41: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.

o Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jesse
Ruderman, Timothy Nikkel, and Jeff Walden reported memory
safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 17, and
Firefox 20. o Bob Clary, Ben Turner, Benoit Jacob, Bobby
Holley, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Andrew
McCreight, Gary Kwong, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman,
Matt Wobensmith, and Mats Palmgren reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox 20.
\*
MFSA 2013-42 / CVE-2013-1670: Security researcher
Cody Crews reported a method to call a content level
constructor that allows for this constructor to have chrome
privileged accesss. This affects chrome object wrappers
(COW) and allows for write actions on objects when only
read actions should be allowed. This can lead to cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2013-43 / CVE-2013-1671: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a mechanism to exploit the
control when set to the file type in order to get the full
path. This can lead to information leakage and could be
combined with other exploits to target attacks on the local
file system.
\*
MFSA 2013-44 / CVE-2013-1672: Security researcher Seb
Patane reported an issue with the Mozilla Maintenance
Service on Windows. This issue allows unprivileged users to
local privilege escalation through the system privileges
used by the service when interacting with local malicious
software. This allows the user to bypass integrity checks
leading to local privilege escalation. Local file system
access is necessary in order for this issue to be
exploitable and it cannot be triggered through web content.
\*
MFSA 2013-45: Security researcher Robert Kugler
discovered that in some instances the Mozilla Maintenance
Service on Windows will be vulnerable to some previously
fixed privilege escalation attacks that allowed for local
privilege escalation. This was caused by the Mozilla
Updater not updating Windows Registry entries for the
Mozilla Maintenance Service, which fixed the earlier issues
present if Firefox 12 had been installed. New installations
of Firefox after version 12 are not affected by this issue.
Local file system access is necessary in order for this
issue to be exploitable and it cannot be triggered through
web content. References: - old MozillaMaintenance Service
registry entry not updated leading to Trusted Path
Privilege Escalation (CVE-2013-1673) - Possible Arbitrary
Code Execution by Update Service (CVE-2012-1942)
\*
MFSA 2013-46 / CVE-2013-1674: Security researcher
Nils reported a use-after-free when resizing video while
playing. This could allow for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2013-47 / CVE-2013-1675: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger discovered that some DOMSVGZoomEvent
functions are used without being properly initialized,

MFSA 2013-48: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series of
use-after-free, out of bounds read, and invalid write
problems rated as moderate to critical as security issues
in shipped software. Some of these issues are potentially
exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We would
also like to thank Abhishek for reporting additional
use-after-free flaws in dir=auto code introduced during
Firefox development. These were fixed before general
release.

We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting additional use-after-free and buffer overflow flaws in code introduced during Firefox development. These were fixed before general release.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

Jesse, is this a regression from [bug 821850](/show_bug.cgi?id=821850 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate running XBL in a separate compartment")? Does it depend on the pref being flipped?

Both assertions sound like things have gone pretty wrong in a way that I could imagine being exploitable, but I can't really make a useful guess about the likelihood/danger off the top of my head.

[Proposed fix](attachment.cgi?id=728488&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=728488&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=840098&attachment=728488)

The root of an anonymous subtree is special in that it is not in its parent's child list. Moving such a root out from under its shadow parent confuses the XBL code (and possibly also the BindToTree code). This patch fixes adoptNode to follow nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore's behavior by making sure we don't move the root of an anonymous subtree out from under it.

Proposed fix
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The patch points directly at the problem (calling adopt node on the root of an anonymous subtree causes problems). However, I don't think that anybody actually knows how to exploit this. We know that it's dangerous, so we're treating it as sec-high, but coming up with an actual exploit is likely many hours worth of work.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Some digging around showed that [bug 650493](/show_bug.cgi?id=650493 "RESOLVED FIXED - Simplify mutation events and userdata handlers") is at fault here (it removed an implicit check for the adopted node being in the child list of the parent).
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
This is extremely unlikely to cause regressions. It introduces an error check that bails out only in cases that would cause this bug.

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1682,
CVE-2013-1684, CVE-2013-1685, CVE-2013-1686, CVE-2013-1687, CVE-2013-1690)

It was found that Thunderbird allowed data to be sent in the body of
XMLHttpRequest (XHR) HEAD requests. In some cases this could allow
attackers to conduct Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
(CVE-2013-1692)

Timing differences in the way Thunderbird processed SVG image files could
allow an attacker to read data across domains, potentially leading to
information disclosure. (CVE-2013-1693)

Two flaws were found in the way Thunderbird implemented some of its
internal structures (called wrappers). An attacker could use these flaws to
bypass some restrictions placed on them. This could lead to unexpected
behavior or a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2013-1694, CVE-2013-1697)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight,
Abhishek Arya, Mariusz Mlynski, Nils, Johnathan Kuskos, Paul Stone, Boris
Zbarsky, and moz\_bug\_r\_a4 as the original reporters of these issues.

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 17.0.7 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

An update that fixes 9 vulnerabilities is now available. It
includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox has been updated to the 17.0.7 ESR version,
which fixes bugs and security issues.
\*
MFSA 2013-49: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, and Andrew McCreight
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 17, and Firefox 21. (CVE-2013-1682)
\*
MFSA 2013-50: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series of
use-after-free problems rated critical as security issues
in shipped software. Some of these issues are potentially
exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We would
also like to thank Abhishek for reporting additional
use-after-free and buffer overflow flaws in code introduced
during Firefox development. These were fixed before general
release.
o Heap-use-after-free in
mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::LookupMediaElementURITable
(CVE-2013-1684) o Heap-use-after-free in
nsIDocument::GetRootElement (CVE-2013-1685) o
Heap-use-after-free in mozilla::ResetDir (CVE-2013-1686)
\*
MFSA 2013-51 / CVE-2013-1687: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that it is possible to compile a
user-defined function in the XBL scope of a specific
element and then trigger an event within this scope to run
code. In some circumstances, when this code is run, it can
access content protected by System Only Wrappers (SOW) and
chrome-privileged pages. This could potentially lead to
arbitrary code execution. Additionally, Chrome Object
Wrappers (COW) can be bypassed by web content to access
privileged methods, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack from privileged pages.
\*
MFSA 2013-53 / CVE-2013-1690: Security researcher
Nils reported that specially crafted web content using the
onreadystatechange event and reloading of pages could
sometimes cause a crash when unmapped memory is executed.
This crash is potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-54 / CVE-2013-1692: Security researcher
Johnathan Kuskos reported that Firefox is sending data in
the body of XMLHttpRequest (XHR) HEAD requests, which goes
agains the XHR specification. This can potentially be used
for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks against sites
which do not distinguish between HEAD and POST requests.
\*
MFSA 2013-55 / CVE-2013-1693: Security researcher
Paul Stone of Context Information Security discovered that
timing differences in the processing of SVG format images
with filters could allow for pixel values to be read. This
could potentially allow for text values to be read across
domains, leading to information disclosure.
\*
MFSA 2013-59 / CVE-2013-1697: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that XrayWrappers can be
bypassed to call content-defined toString and valueOf
methods through DefaultValue. This can lead to unexpected
behavior when privileged code acts on the incorrect values.
