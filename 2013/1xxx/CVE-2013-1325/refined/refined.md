Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-1325:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper handling of objects in memory when Microsoft Office components process specially crafted WordPerfect document (.wpd) files. This memory corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow in the way Microsoft Office parses specially crafted WordPerfect files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- Complete control of the affected system: If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can take full control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer user rights would be less impacted.

**Attack vectors:**
- Email: An attacker sends a specially crafted .wpd file to the user and convinces them to open it.
- Web-based attacks: An attacker hosts a website containing the malicious .wpd file or uses compromised websites/ads. They would need to convince users to visit the site and open the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious WordPerfect document (.wpd) file.
- Ability to deliver the file to a user via email or host the file on a website.
- Ability to convince the user to open the file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the security bulletin.
- There were no known reports of exploitation at the time of the bulletin's release.
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and some versions of 2010. Specifically, it impacts file format converters in affected versions of Microsoft Office.
- Microsoft Office 2010 SP1 is affected, but not SP2
- Microsoft Office 2013 and RT are affected.
- A workaround to restrict access to the affected WordPerfect file converter (wpft632.cnv) is mentioned, but it reduces functionality by preventing users from using the WordPerfect converter.
- The fix involves correcting how Microsoft Office parses the .wpd files.
