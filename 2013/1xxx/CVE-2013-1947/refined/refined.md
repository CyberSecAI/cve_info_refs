Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is associated with CVE-2013-1947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically filenames and other data, before passing it to shell commands. This allows for the injection of arbitrary shell metacharacters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core weakness is that the `kelredd-pruview` gem directly incorporates user-provided data into shell commands without proper escaping or sanitization. This occurs in several places, including:
    - `lib/pruview/document.rb`: When processing document previews, the `convert` and `identify` commands are vulnerable.
    - `lib/pruview/video.rb`: When handling video files, the `FLVTOOL` and `ffmpeg` commands are susceptible.
    - `lib/pruview/video_image.rb`: When generating video preview images using `ffmpeg`, the command is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server hosting the application that uses the vulnerable gem. The commands are executed with the privileges of the user running the application.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the affected system. This could result in data theft, system modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Filenames:** An attacker could craft filenames containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&`, `$(command)`) and upload/provide these files to the vulnerable application. When the application processes these files using the `kelredd-pruview` gem, the malicious shell code embedded within the filename is executed.
- **Video/Document Processing:** Any user-controlled data passed as a source path to the pruview methods is vulnerable to injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable application to process a specially crafted filename or other user-supplied input that the gem uses when executing shell commands.
- **Application Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application in a way that triggers the gem functionality that processes user supplied input, such as by uploading or processing a document or video.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 0.3.8 of the `kelredd-pruview` Ruby gem.
- The issue was discovered by Larry W. Cashdollar.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2013-1947.
