Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2013-1468:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient verification of the HTTP request origin in the `/admin.php` script within Piwigo. This allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) [CWE-352]

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to visit a specially crafted webpage and create arbitrary PHP files on the remote server.
- In the provided proof of concept, this leads to arbitrary code execution via the creation of a PHP file with `phpinfo();`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious webpage.
- The malicious webpage contains a crafted form that sends a request to the vulnerable `/admin.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage with the malicious code.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in Piwigo administrator into visiting this webpage.
- Successful exploitation requires that the "LocalFiles Editor" plugin is enabled in Piwigo (this plugin is disabled by default).

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit code in the proof of concept uses a form with hidden fields to specify the file to create and its content, and then automatically submits the form using JavaScript.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Piwigo version 2.4.7.
