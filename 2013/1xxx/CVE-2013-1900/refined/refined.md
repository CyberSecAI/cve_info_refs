Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-1900:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how the `pgcrypto` contrib module in PostgreSQL (re)initializes its internal random number generator. Specifically, the OpenSSL random number generator state was not reset in each postmaster child process. Instead, it was only initialized when the postmaster process starts. Child processes inherited this initial state, creating predictable sequences.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Predictable random number generation:** The lack of re-seeding in child processes leads to random numbers that could be guessed by other database users, because the random number generator state was not being reset/re-seeded in each new child process. The child process would inherit the pre-initialized random number generator of its parent postmaster.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Compromised security of cryptographic functions**: If an attacker can predict random numbers generated by `contrib/pgcrypto` functions, it could weaken security relying on those random values. For example, password hashes or any other cryptographically generated information could be easily compromised.
- **Increased vulnerability to attacks:** This weakness may enable further attacks if cryptographic functions that rely on those predictable random numbers are used.
- **Data Exposure**: Another database user could potentially guess the random numbers and gain access to protected information or operations.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Database user with access to the PostgreSQL server:** An attacker needs to be a valid database user with access to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Valid database user privileges to connect to the server and execute code that generates random numbers using `pgcrypto` functions.
- In a specific case the attacker needs to be able to make repeated connections to gather a set of known/predictable random number sequences, this would only be practical if the server's `ssl=on` setting is used, but most connections don't actually use SSL.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is more significant when the PostgreSQL server is configured with `ssl = on` but most connections do not use SSL encryption.
- The vulnerability is specific to the `pgcrypto` module and its functions that require a random seed.
- The issue was fixed by ensuring that the OpenSSL randomness state is reset in each new postmaster child process.
- Some content mentions that the fix requires a `REINDEX` command to rebuild GiST indexes, but this is not directly related to CVE-2013-1900, but other issues fixed by the same release(s).
