{
  "CVE-2013-1774": {
    "description": "The chase_port function in drivers/usb/serial/io_ti.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via an attempted /dev/ttyUSB read or write operation on a disconnected Edgeport USB serial converter.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `chase_port` function within the `drivers/usb/serial/io_ti.c` file of the Linux kernel. This occurs when a USB serial device using the Edgeport driver is disconnected while its corresponding `/dev/ttyUSB` file is still in use.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference due to missing check for `tty` pointer."

      "impact": "System crash (Denial of Service).",

        "Local user with ability to read/write from /dev/ttyUSB file can trigger the vulnerability by disconnecting the USB serial device while it is still in use."
