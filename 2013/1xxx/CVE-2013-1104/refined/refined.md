Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-1104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a remote code execution vulnerability in the HTTP Profiling feature of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) devices. This vulnerability stems from improper handling of crafted User-Agent strings sent to the device via HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the User-Agent string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable Cisco WLC device. This could lead to:
*   Complete compromise of the device
*   Manipulation of wireless network configurations
*   Potential network disruption
*   Data theft or manipulation

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted User-Agent string via HTTP requests to the device when HTTP Profiling is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the WLC's management interface.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WLC device.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and how to craft the malicious User-Agent string.

**Additional Details:**

*   This vulnerability specifically affects Cisco WLC Software version 7.3.101.0 when the HTTP Profiling feature is enabled.
*   A workaround involves disabling the HTTP Profiling feature.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc15636.
