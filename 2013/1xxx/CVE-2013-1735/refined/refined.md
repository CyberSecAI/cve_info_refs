Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1735:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition triggered during scrolling of an image document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Use-after-free:** The `ScrollbarActivity` object is accessed after it has been freed from memory. This leads to a memory corruption issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Memory corruption:** An attacker can cause memory corruption.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption can lead to an application crash, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** In browser contexts, the memory corruption could be exploited to potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the exploitation of a specially crafted web page that triggers the vulnerable code path during scrolling.
*   In the context of email clients like Thunderbird, where JavaScript is often disabled by default, this specific vulnerability is less likely to be directly exploited through email. However, it poses a risk in scenarios where a browser or browser-like context is used with scripting enabled, such as viewing RSS feeds with full remote content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to make the targeted application load and render a malicious web page.
*   The attacker must craft the web page such that it triggers the vulnerable code path associated with image document scrolling.
*   In the case of applications like Thunderbird where scripting is disabled by default, the attacker may have to trick the user into enabling scripting in a browser like context or using a feature of the application that uses a browser like context with scripting enabled (viewing full content of RSS feeds).

**Summary of Technical Details and descriptions:**
The vulnerability involves a use-after-free in the `mozilla::layout::ScrollbarActivity` class. The issue is triggered during the scrolling of image documents. The vulnerability occurs when the `ScrollbarActivity` object is accessed after the memory it occupies has been freed. This is due to the shell being destroyed before some operations involving `ScrollbarActivity`.
The fix involves holding a strong reference to the pres shell while scrolling, and checking for damage afterwards.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content shows this CVE is linked with CVE-2013-1736, they both stem from scrolling related issues, but 2013-1736 is linked to a memory corruption in `nsGfxScrollFrameInner::IsLTR()`, rather than use-after-free in `ScrollbarActivity`.
*   The vulnerability affects various Mozilla products, including Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey.
*   Several sources mention that the vulnerability is exploitable through a malicious web site.
*   The fix requires updating to the patched versions of the software.
