{
  "CVE-2013-1675": {
    "description": "Mozilla community member Ms2ger discovered that some DOMSVGZoomEvent functions are used without being properly initialized, causing unitialized memory to be used when they are called. This can lead to a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "root_cause": "Some DOMSVGZoomEvent functions were used without proper initialization, leading to the usage of uninitialized memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of uninitialized memory",
      "Information Leakage"
    ],
    "impact": "The use of uninitialized memory could lead to an information leak, potentially exposing sensitive data to web content. Also, a crash could occur.",
     "attack_vector": "By triggering specific DOMSVGZoomEvent functions through web content, the uninitialized memory could be accessed, or an exploitable crash could occur.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to craft a website or webpage that uses  DOMSVGZoomEvent and have a user open it. This would require scripting to be enabled."
