Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0179:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow when memcached is run in verbose mode (-vv) and processes a deletion request (memrm).
- Specifically, when printing the key to be deleted in verbose mode, memcached does not null-terminate the key before passing it to `fprintf`. This causes `fprintf` to potentially read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the lack of null termination of the key being printed in verbose mode, leading to a buffer overflow when using `fprintf`.
- **Lack of input sanitization/validation:** The code doesn't properly sanitize or validate the key length before printing it, which allows the overflow to occur.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service. The buffer overflow causes memcached to crash, disrupting its ability to serve requests.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious delete request via the `memrm` command or similar tools using the binary protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send delete requests to the memcached server.
- **Verbose mode enabled:** The memcached server must be running with the `-vv` (verbose) option enabled, which is not the default configuration, and usually only used for testing/debugging. This limits the exposure to production systems.
- **Trusted user/host:** While the documentation emphasizes that memcached should only be accessible by trusted users and hosts, this vulnerability could still be exploited in scenarios where this advice isn't followed.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is considered low impact due to the requirement of verbose mode (-vv) to be enabled and the general recommendation that memcached should not be exposed to untrusted networks.
- Although the issue could lead to a crash (DoS), there's no indication that the vulnerability could be exploited for more malicious purposes (e.g. arbitrary code execution), especially when compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE/SSP, which is commonly done with Linux distributions
- A patch has been created and is available that fixes this issue.
