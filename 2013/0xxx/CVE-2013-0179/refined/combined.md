| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=895054#c0)  Jeremy Sowden    2013-01-14 12:10:54 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  When run with "-vv", on receipt of a binary-protocol deletion request, memcached prints out the key to be deleted in a way that can lead to a buffer overrun and crash.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  1.4.4, although this currently affects all later versions.  How reproducible:  Run memcached with "-vv", use memrm to send deletion requests and observe output.  Steps to Reproduce:  1. memcached -p 12345 -vv 2>&1 | grep '^Deleting' 2. memrm --servers localhost:12345 --binary ABCDEF xyz 3. Check the output from memcached.  Actual results:  [jsowden:~] $ memcached -p 2300 -m 64 -c 1024 -r -vv 2>&1 | grep 'Deleting' Deleting ABCDEF Deleting xyzDEF  Expected results:  [jsowden:~] $ memcached -p 2300 -m 64 -c 1024 -r -vv 2>&1 | grep 'Deleting' Deleting ABCDEF Deleting xyz  Additional info:  I've opened a bug report upstream: <https://code.google.com/p/memcached/issues/detail?id=306>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=895054#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-14 16:59:20 UTC  ``` Proposed patch:  <https://code.google.com/p/memcached/issues/attachmentText?id=306&aid=3060004000&name=0001-Fix-buffer-overrun-when-logging-key-to-delete-in-bin.patch&token=3GEzHThBL5cxmUrsYANkW03RrNY%3A1358179503096>  However, I'm not sure if we would consider this a security flaw.  For one, you need to run memcached with -vv (probably not used in production but for testing).  It would also indicate that this would be a local-only flaw (or from other trusted source) as the docs explicitly say that you shouldn't expose memcached to untrusted users:  <https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/NewConfiguringServer#Networking>  In particular:  "Memcached does not spend much, if any, effort in ensuring its defensibility from random internet connections. So you must not expose memcached directly to the internet, or otherwise any untrusted users. Using SASL authentication here helps, but should not be totally trusted."  I guess this could be considered a low-impact security flaw due to the conditions required to make an attack meaningful:  - start memcached with -vv (not the default) - make it available to untrusted users (not recommended as per docs) - memcached runs non-root and with FORTIFY_SOURCE/SSP any buffer overflow should be rendered a simple DoS   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=895054#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-14 17:08:28 UTC  ``` Created memcached tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 895139](show_bug.cgi?id=895139 "CLOSED EOL - Possible crash when handling deletion requests [epel-5]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 895140](show_bug.cgi?id=895140 "CLOSED ERRATA - Possible crash when handling deletion requests [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=895054#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-14 17:14:13 UTC  ``` CVE request:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/14/4>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=895054#c6)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-14 20:49:54 UTC  ``` This was assigned [CVE-2013-0179](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0179).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=895054#c7)  Fedora Update System    2014-02-03 02:42:13 UTC  ``` memcached-1.4.17-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request: memcached DoS when printing out keys to be deleted in
 verbose mode

We got a report about a DoS in memcached when run with -vv (verbose
mode) and a request to delete a key is sent to the server (via memrm).
Because memcached doesn't null terminate the keys as it prints them,
fprintf may run off the end of the buffer.

This isn't a very significant issue (even without SSP/FORTIFY_SOURCE if
you could do something more malicious, memcached won't run as root).
Also note the docs indicate that memcached should only be accessible via
trusted users/hosts and not the internet at large, so the exposure
should be minimal.

Could a CVE be assigned for this?  Thanks.

# USN-2080-1: Memcached vulnerabilities

13 January 2014

Several security issues were fixed in Memcached.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [memcached](/security/cves?package=memcached) - A high-performance memory object caching system

## Details

Stefan Bucur discovered that Memcached incorrectly handled certain large

body lengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause Memcached to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4971](/security/CVE-2011-4971))

Jeremy Sowden discovered that Memcached incorrectly handled logging certain

details when the -vv option was used. An attacker could use this issue to

cause Memcached to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-0179](/security/CVE-2013-0179))

It was discovered that Memcached incorrectly handled SASL authentication.

A remote attacker could use this issue to bypass SASL authentication

completely. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.10, Ubuntu 13.04 and Ubuntu

13.10. ([CVE-2013-7239](/security/CVE-2013-7239))
