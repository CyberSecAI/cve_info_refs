Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-0152:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Xen hypervisor's handling of nested virtualization for Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) guests.
- A missing error handling cleanup in the code allows a guest to repeatedly enable nested virtualization.
- This repeated operation leads to a memory leak, where unbounded amounts of memory are consumed over time.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak due to improper resource management.
- Lack of proper error handling during nested virtualization enabling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious HVM guest can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the entire system by exhausting the host's memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to control a HVM guest on a vulnerable Xen system.
- The attacker leverages the ability to repeatedly enable nested virtualization within the guest.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a running HVM guest.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the nested virtualization functionality.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Xen 4.2 and unstable versions. Xen 4.1 and earlier are not affected.
- The vulnerability is specific to HVM guests and does not impact Paravirtualized (PV) guests.
- Patches are available to address this issue, and they can be applied with or without also patching another vulnerability (XSA-34).

The Gentoo Security Advisory also mentions this CVE, but it is part of a larger list of vulnerabilities affecting Xen. The advisory indicates that a fix is available by upgrading the relevant packages.
