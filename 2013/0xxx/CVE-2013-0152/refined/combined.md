How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 35 (CVE-2013-0152) - Nested HVM exposes
 host to being driven out of memory by guest

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-0152 / XSA-35
                           version 4

       Nested HVM exposes host to being driven out of memory by guest

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Fix corrupt patch xsa35-4.2-with-xsa34.patch.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Guests are currently permitted to enable nested virtualization on
themselves. Missing error handling cleanup in the handling code makes
it possible for a guest, particularly a multi-vCPU one, to repeatedly
invoke this operation, thus causing a leak of - over time - unbounded
amounts of memory.

IMPACT
======

A malicious domain can mount a denial of service attack affecting the
whole system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only Xen 4.2 and Xen unstable are vulnerable. Xen 4.1 and earlier are
not vulnerable.

The vulnerability is only exposed by HVM guests.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

To fix both XSA 34 and XSA 35, first apply xsa34-4.2.patch from XSA 34
and then *also* apply xsa35-4.2-with-xsa34.patch from this advisory.

To fix this issue without addressing XSA 34, use xsa35.patch.

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```
