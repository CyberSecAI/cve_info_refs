Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-0730 (based on the forum post mentioning a fix related to Secunia and the Github commit link)

**Root Cause:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Newscoop software. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into a user's browser session when editing user profiles or languages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, which occurs because user-supplied input (likely related to language or user details) is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code within a user's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Malicious scripts could modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or display fake login prompts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered through user-provided data when editing user profiles or languages via the admin interface, likely in the backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to Admin Interface:** The attacker would need to have access to the Newscoop admin interface where users or languages can be edited.
*   **Ability to Inject Malicious Script:** The attacker must be able to input a malicious script into a form field within the application (e.g. when editing a language or a user profile)

**Technical Details:**
*   The fix involves sanitizing the user input in `LanguagesController.php` and `UserController.php`. The code changes add explicit casting to integer, ensuring that the values retrieved from requests are treated as integers, which would prevent injection of arbitrary text.
*  The commit message indicates "fix-user-edit-injection".
*   The forum post references that the vulnerability is not easy to exploit but strongly recommends applying the patch.
*   The forum post mentions that the vulnerability affects Newscoop versions 4.0.x and 4.1.0.

In summary, the identified vulnerability is a cross-site scripting issue caused by unsanitized user input. Attackers with access to the admin interface can exploit this to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of an affected user, potentially leading to data compromise or account hijacking.
