{
  "CVE-2013-0190": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way the xen_failsafe_callback() function in the Linux kernel handled the failed iret (interrupt return) instruction notification from the Xen hypervisor. An unprivileged user in a 32-bit para-virtualized guest could use this flaw to crash the guest.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `xen_failsafe_callback` function in the Linux kernel incorrectly sets up its stack when an `iret` instruction fails and the hypervisor injects a failsafe callback. This results in the stack pointer being incorrect when entering the `iret_exc` error path.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack corruption due to incorrect stack pointer manipulation."
       ],
       "impact": "A local, unprivileged user in a 32-bit para-virtualized Xen guest can crash the guest kernel or cause it to operate erroneously.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A user-space application within a 32-bit PV Xen guest can trigger this vulnerability. For example, by loading an LDT code selector, then changing the code selector to be not-present, thus creating a race condition where the hypervisor returns from an interrupt, causing a fault during its own iret, and injecting a failsafe_callback into the kernel."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "An unprivileged user within a 32-bit para-virtualized Xen guest. Ability to manipulate code selectors."
