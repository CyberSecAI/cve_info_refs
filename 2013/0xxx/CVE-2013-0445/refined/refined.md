Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-0445:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) component of OpenJDK. Specifically, the issue is related to insufficient privilege checking within the AWT code, allowing an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient privilege checking:** The core weakness is the lack of proper verification of privileges by the AWT component before certain actions are performed.
*   **Bypass of Java sandbox:** This weakness enables untrusted code to circumvent the security mechanisms intended to isolate applications and restrict access to system resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploit could allow an untrusted Java applet or application to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Java virtual machine.
*   **System compromise:** Given the privileges of the VM, a successful attacker may be able to compromise the system.
*   **Bypass of Java sandbox restrictions**: This is mentioned in both the bug report descriptions and the errata notes, specifically noting the insufficient privilege checking, and allowing access that should have been restricted by the Java sandbox.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Java applets:** An attacker can exploit this flaw by enticing a user to visit a website hosting a specially crafted malicious Java applet.
*   **Compromised websites:** Attackers could also inject malicious Java applets into legitimate websites, leading to a "drive-by download" attack, where an unsuspecting visitor's system is compromised.
*  **Untrusted Java applications** As a standalone applications are also vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote execution:** The attacker does not require physical access to the targeted system; the exploitation can happen remotely by having the user load a malicious applet or application.
*   **Social engineering:** Attackers might need to use social engineering tactics to trick users into visiting malicious websites or running untrusted applications.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is associated with Oracle bug ID 8001057.
*   The vulnerability affects various versions of OpenJDK including IcedTea6 (1.11.6, 1.12.1) and IcedTea7 (2.1.5, 2.2.5, 2.3.6).
*   Red Hat has issued several security advisories to address the vulnerability in their various products (RHSA-2013:0236, RHSA-2013:0237, RHSA-2013:0245, RHSA-2013:0246, RHSA-2013:0247).
*   The fix has been backported to older versions of Java included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
*   Upstream fix committed in IcedTea7 repositories:  <http://icedtea.classpath.org/hg/release/icedtea7-forest-2.3/jdk/rev/6527ae06da69>
