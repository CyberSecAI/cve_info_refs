Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0981:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `IOUSBDeviceFamily` driver using pipe object pointers that originated from userspace without proper validation.

**Vulnerability:**
- **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation of pipe object pointers passed from user space to the kernel.
- **Vulnerability Type:** Use of user-controlled pointers in kernel space.

**Impact:**
- A local user can achieve arbitrary code execution within the kernel.

**Attack Vector:**
- Exploitation involves manipulating pipe object pointers in userspace and passing them to the vulnerable `IOUSBDeviceFamily` driver in the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a local user on the affected device.
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the USB driver API in order to pass specially crafted pipe object pointers.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was addressed by performing additional validation of pipe object pointers.
- The affected products include Apple TV (2nd generation and later) running version 5.2.1, and iOS devices (iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch 4th generation and later, and iPad 2 and later) running version 6.1.3.
- The vulnerability is credited to evad3rs.
