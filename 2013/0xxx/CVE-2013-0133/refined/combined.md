## Plesk Panel 11.0.9 privilege escalation vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#310500

Original Release Date: 2013-04-10 | Last Revised: 2014-07-30

---

### Overview

Plesk Panel 11.0.9 and possibly earlier versions contains multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

### Description

| Plesk Panel contains multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities which may allow an attacker to run arbitrary code as the root user.  Special-case rules in Plesk's custom version of Apache suexec allow execution of arbitrary code as an arbitrary user id above a certain minimum value. In addition, several administrative or system accounts have a user ID above this minimum.     + Plesk's /usr/sbin/suexec binary (the binary may be present in additional locations, always with suexec in the filename) always allows the binary 'cgi-wrapper', bypassing restrictions on the ownership of the file to be called. Since cgi-wrapper's function is to execute a PHP script based on environment variables (and suexec does not sanitize these environment variables) this allows execution of arbitrary PHP code with a user id above a minimum user ID value that is hardcoded in the suid binary. CVE-2013-0132    + The program /usr/local/psa/admin/sbin/wrapper allows the user psaadm to execute various administrative scripts with root privileges. Some of these scripts call external programs without specifying the full path. By specifying a malicious PATH environment variable, an attacker can cause the administrative scripts to call his own program instead of the intended system program. CVE-2013-0133  The CVSS scores below apply to CVE-2013-0133. |

### Impact

| An authenticated attacker maybe be able to escalate their privileges to root allowing them to run arbitrary code as the root user. |

| Parallel's Plesk Panel [advisory](http://kb.parallels.com/115942) states the following workaround:  *Disable mod\_php, mod\_python, and mod\_perl and use Fast CGI and/or CGI, which are not affected by this security vulnerability.Below is the example on how to switch mod\_php to fast\_cgi for all existing domains:# mysql -uadmin --skip-column-names -p`cat /etc/psa/.psa.shadow` psa -e "select name from domains where htype = 'vrt\_hst';" | awk -F \| '{print $1}' | while read a; do /usr/local/psa/bin/domain -u $a -php\_handler\_type fastcgi; doneAfter the fix for the issue is published, Parallels still recommends that you avoid using these Apache modules (mod\_php, mod\_python, and mod\_perl) and instead use Fast CGI or CGI modes for improved security on Apache.For additional details, please refer to* [Parallels Plesk Panel for Linux Advanced Administration Guide, Enhancing Security.](http://download1.parallels.com/Plesk/PP11/11.0/Doc/en-US/online/plesk-linux-advanced-administration-guide/index.htm?fileName=68755.htm) |
