Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `/usr/local/psa/admin/sbin/wrapper` program in Plesk Panel. This program, executed by the `psaadm` user, allows for the execution of various administrative scripts with root privileges.
*   The administrative scripts called by the wrapper program execute external programs without specifying their full paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure PATH Environment Variable:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper path specification when calling external programs within the administrative scripts. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `PATH` environment variable to point to a malicious program of their choice.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The wrapper script runs with root privileges, which means that by calling a malicious program, the attacker can effectively execute arbitrary code as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation to Root:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to root, the highest privilege level on the system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With root privileges, the attacker can execute any arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack vector is primarily local, as it requires the ability to execute the wrapper script ( `/usr/local/psa/admin/sbin/wrapper` ) as the `psaadm` user and to modify the `PATH` environment variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user, specifically the `psaadm` user or have the ability to run programs as that user.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system to manipulate the environment variables and execute the vulnerable script.
