{
  "CVE-2013-0183": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Rack web server was vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack due to its unbounded processing of excessively long lines in multipart form data.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the `Rack::Multipart::Parser` component's use of the `#gets` method, which is unbounded and can lead to excessive memory consumption when processing very long input lines. This lack of input validation or length limitation allows for the exploitation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can trigger an out-of-memory error and cause a denial-of-service on the web server by sending an HTTP request containing an excessively long multipart boundary line.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, and attackers send a specially crafted HTTP POST request with multipart form data containing an extremely long boundary line.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No authentication is required, and the attacker can be external to the network where the server is located."
