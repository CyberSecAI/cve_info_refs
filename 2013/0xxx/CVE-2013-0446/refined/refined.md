  "CVE-2013-0446": {
    "description": "The Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows users to run Java applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Oracle has made the JRE available for multiple operating systems. The Java JRE plug-in provides its own Security Manager. Typically, a web applet runs with a security manager provided by the browser or Java Web Start plugin. Oracle's document states, \"If there is a security manager already installed, this method first calls the security manager's checkPermission method with a RuntimePermission(\"setSecurityManager\") permission to ensure it's safe to replace the existing security manager. This may result in throwing a SecurityException\". By leveraging a number of vulnerabilities, an untrusted Java applet can escalate its privileges to allow full privileges, without requiring code signing. Other vulnerabilities can cause exploitable memory corruption, which could affect Java applets, as well as Java applications, depending on what the Java application does and how it may process untrusted data. Oracle Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier Java versions are affected.At least one of these vulnerabilities is reportedly being exploited in the wild.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities, including privilege escalation and memory corruption issues, within the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate security manager enforcement",
        "Memory corruption vulnerabilities",
        "Insufficient permission checks"
       ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system with the privileges of the Java plugin process, or the affected application..",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious Java applets hosted on websites",
        "Compromised websites hosting malicious Java applets (drive-by downloads)",
        "Processing untrusted data by vulnerable Java applications"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities by enticing a user to visit a malicious website or by compromising a legitimate website. Exploiting vulnerabilities in standalone apps requires specific conditions, such as the application processing untrusted data.",
      "attacker_position": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker"
    },
        "affected_products": [
          "Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE)",
          "Oracle Java Software Development Kit (JDK)",
           "Web browsers using the Java plug-in",
           "Java applets and applications"
        ],
        "remediation": "Apply the updates from Oracle. For Java 7 Update 11 and earlier, upgrade to Java 7 Update 13 or later. For Java 6 Update 38 and earlier, upgrade to Java 6 Update 39 or later. Additionally, consider disabling Java in web browsers or restrict access to Java applets via network filtering."
