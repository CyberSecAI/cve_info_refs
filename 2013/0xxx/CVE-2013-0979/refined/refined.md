- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `lockdownd` daemon, when restoring from backup, was changing file permissions even if the path included a symbolic link.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of symbolic links during file permission changes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user may be able to change permissions on arbitrary files.
- **Attack vectors**: Restoring from a backup on a vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the device.

The provided information is consistent with the CVE description, which states that a local user can change arbitrary file permissions.
