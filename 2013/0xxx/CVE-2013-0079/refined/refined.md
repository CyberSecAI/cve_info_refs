Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-0079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the Microsoft Office 2010 Visio iFilter (VISFILT.DLL). Specifically, the Visio iFilter improperly handles memory allocation when processing specially crafted Visio files. This is a type confusion vulnerability related to how the Visio Viewer handles tree objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability in the Visio iFilter.
- Improper handling of memory allocation during the parsing of specially crafted Visio files.
- Type confusion vulnerability when handling Visio tree objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with the privileges of the process using the iFilter.
- Complete control of an affected system if the user has administrative rights.
- An attacker can install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Less impact for users with fewer user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** Sending a malicious Visio file to a user and convincing them to open it.
- **Web-based attacks:** Hosting a malicious Visio file on a website or through compromised sites. An attacker needs to convince the user to visit the site and open the file.
- **Shared drive/folder attacks:** Placing a malicious Visio file in a shared location that is then indexed by Windows Search.
- Other applications that use iFilters (e.g., Microsoft Windows Search, Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), SharePoint Portal Server, Exchange Server, and SQL Server)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a specially crafted Visio file to trigger the memory corruption.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file to a target user, either through email, web browsing, or file sharing.
- For shared drive/folder attack, the attacker needs write access to a location indexed by Windows Search.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious Visio file.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS13-023](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-023).
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Visio Viewer 2010, Microsoft Office 2010 Filter Pack and, although not directly vulnerable, the same component is present in Microsoft Visio 2010 and a patch is available.
- The exploit can be triggered through various attack vectors, including placing a Visio file in a location that is indexed by Windows Search.
- Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation at the time of the initial bulletin release.
- This was a privately reported vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Aniway.Anyway@gmail.com, working with VeriSign iDefense Labs, and Will Dormann of the CERT/CC.
