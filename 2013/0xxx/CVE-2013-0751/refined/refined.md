Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that touch events in Mozilla Firefox (and SeaMonkey) are not properly isolated between iframes. When multiple iframes are present on the same HTML page, an iframe can observe touch events and their associated targets occurring within other iframes on the same page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Iframe Touch Event Leakage:** The core issue is the unintended sharing of touch events across iframes, violating the expected isolation.
- **Information Leakage:** An iframe can potentially identify the specific nodes being touched in other iframes, and if from the same origin, properties and methods could be accessed.
- **Potential XSS:** While same-origin policy prevents direct access to cross-domain iframe content, the information leakage could potentially be leveraged if combined with another vulnerability to bypass same origin restrictions and achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the leakage of touch event information, such as the touched node or the location of touch events, from one iframe to another. If the iframes have the same origin, there could also be access to properties and methods on the target node of the other iframe.
- **Potential for XSS:** If an attacker can bypass the same-origin policy using this or other vulnerabilities, they might be able to inject malicious code into another frame.
- **Phishing/UI Spoofing:** Though not directly related to touch events, the related CVE-2013-0759 highlights that similar vulnerabilities can be used in phishing attacks to spoof the URL in the address bar, which, while not directly related to touch events, demonstrates a general category of vulnerabilities that can be used for social engineering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious web page containing multiple iframes could exploit this.
- The attacker needs to host the malicious page and entice the victim to visit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and host a webpage with multiple iframes.
- The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to interact with the malicious page (social engineering, etc.).

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was considered a "moderate" severity.
- The issue primarily affects Firefox for Android where the touch events are used.
- The fix involved ensuring touch events were correctly routed and isolated per document or iframe, preventing the unauthorized sharing of touch event information between iframes.
- This vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 18, SeaMonkey 2.15 and also addressed in other related Mozilla products and SUSE Linux distributions.
- The fix was also implemented in WebKit for other browser platforms such as Chrome.
