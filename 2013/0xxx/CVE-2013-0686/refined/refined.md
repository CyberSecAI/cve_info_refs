Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-0686:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper Input Validation: The software does not properly validate input, specifically concerning XML external entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Unsafe parsing of XML external entities.
*   Allows access to local resources (files and internal resources) via crafted XML files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Disclosure of local or remote resource contents to the attacker's server.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Exploitation involves using specially crafted XML files.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited locally.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to supply crafted XML files to the vulnerable WIS software.
*   Attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Wonderware Information Server (WIS) software. CVE-2013-0686 is specifically related to the improper input validation via XML external entity parsing.
* The CVSS v2 base score for this vulnerability is 6.3 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:C), which suggests that the attack requires local access (AV:L) with medium attack complexity (AC:M), and the impact is primarily on confidentiality (C:C) and availability (A:C). There is no impact on integrity (I:N).
* The document explicitly states that the vulnerability can be exploited locally.
* A patch is available from Invensys to mitigate the vulnerability.
