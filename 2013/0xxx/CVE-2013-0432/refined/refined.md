The vulnerability allows an untrusted Java applet or application to bypass sandbox restrictions and access or modify clipboard data.

Root cause of vulnerability: The AWT component's clipboard handling code does not perform sufficient permission checks.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Insufficient permission checks on clipboard access.

Impact of exploitation:
  - Untrusted Java applets or applications can bypass the Java sandbox and gain access to or modify clipboard data.
  - Can lead to the disclosure or modification of sensitive data present in the clipboard

Attack vectors:
  - Malicious Java applets embedded in web pages.
  - Standalone Java applications handling untrusted data or clipboard content

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Attacker needs to convince a user to run a malicious Java applet or application.
  - No special privileges are required for the attack, beyond the ability to run Java code.
