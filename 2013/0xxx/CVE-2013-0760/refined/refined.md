  "CVE-2013-0760": {
    "description": "Global-buffer-overflow in CharDistributionAnalysis::HandleOneChar",
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to an incorrect size check when handling character encodings. The code uses predefined constant values for table lengths, but the actual table size was different, leading to a read beyond the boundary of the allocated memory.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer. It is also potentially exploitable for arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web pages",
      "Files processed by the browser"
    ],
   "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a specially crafted webpage or file that triggers the vulnerability. No specific position or privilege is required."
  },
  "CVE-2013-0762": {
      "description": "Heap-use-after-free in imgRequest::OnStopFrame",
      "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in how image requests are handled. Specifically, a listener associated with an image request is not properly cleared when a request is canceled, leading to a use-after-free when the listener is accessed after the associated memory is released.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "This use-after-free vulnerability can lead to a crash and is potentially exploitable for arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Specially crafted web pages that cause image loading and cancellation"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick the user into opening a webpage that triggers the vulnerability, no special privileges or position is required."
