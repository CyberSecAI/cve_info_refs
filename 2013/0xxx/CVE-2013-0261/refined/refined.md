{
  "CVE-2013-0261": {
    "Root cause": "Insecure use of /tmp during manifest creation in OpenStack packstack.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Manifest files are written to /tmp with predictable names.",
      "Lack of safe permissions being set on the created files and directories.",
      "Potential race condition between checking for directory existence and creating it."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local attackers could perform a symbolic link attack, overwriting arbitrary files accessible to the user running PackStack with manifest contents. This could lead to a denial of service. Attackers could also read and potentially modify the manifest during creation, modifying the systems being deployed via OpenStack.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Local Access"
     ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": [
       "Local User Account"
    ]
  }
}
