Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2013-0866:

**1. Verification of Relevance**

*   The provided security advisory from Gentoo and the FFmpeg security pages directly mention CVE-2013-0866 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in their respective updates. Therefore, the content is relevant.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The specific root cause of CVE-2013-0866 is not detailed in the provided content. However, it is grouped with other vulnerabilities related to demuxers and decoders of the libav multimedia library. The Gentoo advisory states that the identified issues in FFmpeg could lead to arbitrary code execution or a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, which can be caused by a memory corruption vulnerability or integer overflow, which were mentioned in other CVE descriptions for the same FFmpeg issue.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The weaknesses are located in demuxers and decoders within the FFmpeg/libav library. These weaknesses could stem from memory management issues, incorrect input handling, or other coding errors in the audio or video processing logic.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution**: An attacker could potentially execute malicious code on the vulnerable system.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attacker could cause the application to crash or become unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing its functionality.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is through the processing of malicious audio or video files. It can be assumed from the provided information that the attacker would need to supply a crafted media file to a vulnerable application that utilizes the affected version of FFmpeg/libav library.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker can be in a remote position to exploit this vulnerability by delivering the malicious file, which then would be processed by the vulnerable FFmpeg/libav library. No special access privileges are required beyond the ability to supply the media file to the vulnerable application or library.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201603-06) also lists a multitude of other CVEs fixed in the same update, underscoring the breadth of the issues affecting older versions of FFmpeg, and implies that many of the vulnerabilities are exploitable by remote attackers.
*   The FFmpeg Security page provides a comprehensive history of vulnerabilities and the versions where they were fixed, spanning across different release branches (7.0, 6.1, 6.0, 5.1, 5.0, 4.4, 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 2.8, 2.7, 2.6, 2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, 1.2, 1.1, 1.0, 0.11, 0.10, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5), along with the commit IDs resolving these.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 2793-1) also mentions CVE-2013-0866 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in libav, confirming that the issue is also relevant to the libav package. It provides further evidence for a remote exploitation vector.
*   The Debian security update provides the name of the affected package as `libav` and states that it's not Debian-specific, implying that the vulnerability is present in the upstream source code.

In conclusion, CVE-2013-0866 relates to a vulnerability in FFmpeg/libav that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted media file. The specific root cause is not clear from the provided text, but it appears to relate to vulnerabilities in demuxers and decoders.
