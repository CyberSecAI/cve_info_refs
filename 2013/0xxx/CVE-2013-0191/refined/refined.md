Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `pam-pgsql` handles NULL values returned by SQL queries when retrieving a user's password. If the SQL query designed to fetch a user's password returns NULL, `pam-pgsql` incorrectly interprets this as a valid password match, effectively allowing authentication without a password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper NULL Handling:**  The core issue is that `pam-pgsql` doesn't treat a NULL password from the database as an authentication failure.
- **Authentication Bypass:** This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication checks if the database query returns a NULL password, granting unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to log in with any password (or no password) if the SQL query for that user's password returns NULL
- **Compromised Systems:** Successful login could lead to full control of the system depending on access permissions

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Authentication:** An attacker could directly attempt to log in through any service that uses `pam-pgsql` for authentication.
- **SQL Query Manipulation (Potential):** If the attacker could manipulate the SQL query to return NULL they could potentially exploit the issue. However, there is no direct indication on the provided content of this capability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to attempt a login via services configured to use `pam-pgsql`
- Knowledge of a target user and system that uses `pam-pgsql` authentication
-  No specific information is present regarding position. It is assumed that the attacker would need to access a service locally or remotely which uses `pam-pgsql` authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

- The initial report highlights the uncertainty whether this constitutes a security bug, but it was agreed to fix the issue.
- The vulnerability is specifically tied to the use of `pam-pgsql` with database queries returning NULL passwords.
- There is no specific mention about the database used, it is assumed any database supported by `pam-pgsql` could be affected.
