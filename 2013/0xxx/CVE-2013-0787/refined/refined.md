Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0787:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the HTML editor of Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey. This occurs when content scripts are executed by the `document.execCommand()` function while internal editor operations are in progress. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when the `nsHTMLEditor`'s edit rules object is replaced during the execution of a script, leading to a use-after-free condition. This is further triggered by the flush happening in `nsEditor::IsPreformatted`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The vulnerability is a classic use-after-free where memory allocated for the editor's rule object is freed but then accessed by the program.
- Inadequate synchronization: Lack of proper synchronization between the editor's internal operations and the execution of Javascript is the root cause of the vulnerability, where a flush in style ends up executing a script via a resize handler while still having editor code on the stack, which could re-initialize the editor object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application. This could lead to a complete compromise of the user's system.
- Crashing: The content could also cause the application to crash, which can lead to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious web page: An attacker could craft a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability when loaded in an affected application. This page utilizes the HTML editor and JavaScript to trigger the vulnerability.
- Malicious RSS Feeds (Thunderbird): In the case of Thunderbird, the vulnerability can also be exploited by rendering malicious content in an RSS feed since Javascript execution is disabled for regular mail.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can be remote, sending the malicious payload over the network or via web browsing.
- Ability to host a malicious website: The attacker needs to host the crafted malicious web page.
- Tricking user into opening the crafted page: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious page using the HTML editor of the affected product or open malicious content in an RSS reader.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by VUPEN Security through the TippingPoint Zero Day Initiative.
- Mozilla identified the issue as a regression introduced by a change related to HTML editor functionality.
- Patches have been applied to multiple versions of Firefox (19.0.2 and ESR 17.0.4), Thunderbird (17.0.4), and SeaMonkey (2.16.1).
- The patch involves preventing flushing within the `IsPreformatted` method, which was causing the vulnerability. It also involves holding a strong reference to the rules object and checking for nulls.
- The vulnerability can be triggered via `document.execCommand()` with content scripts. The flush is triggered by resize events, such as from the "I blocked your popup" notification, which triggers the script execution while editor code is on the stack.
- There was an attempt to block script execution within `execCommand`, but this broke other tests.
-  The vulnerability could also be exploited in Thunderbird when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.
- The fixes include code that was added to ensure a strong reference to the editor's `mRules` object is always held when calling into it to prevent the virtual call on deleted memory, as well as adding null checks to editor code.
