- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication mechanisms that allow remote, unauthenticated users to enumerate user accounts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** User enumeration, information disclosure, weak or missing password requirement for some accounts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain a list of user accounts, including information about which accounts do not require a password. This information can be used for further attacks such as brute-forcing password for accounts or leveraging accounts with no passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system. No authentication is required.
