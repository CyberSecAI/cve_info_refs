The provided content relates to CVE-2013-0754.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free that occurs in the `ListenerManager` when garbage collection is forced after data in listener objects have been allocated in some circumstances.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability.
- Improper handling of garbage collection.
- Memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox/Thunderbird/SeaMonkey.
- Denial of service via application crash.
- Potential for remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious web pages that trigger the vulnerability through JavaScript or other content.
- Specially crafted HTML email messages (though javascript is disabled by default in Thunderbird and Seamonkey email messages, the vulnerability is exploitable when viewing remote content like RSS feeds)
- Malicious content delivered through plugins.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to deliver malicious content to the user (via web pages, emails, etc.)
- Ability to trigger garbage collection and manipulate the listeners object.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when the number of jsvals in the `listeners` vector exceeds 10, at which point storage is allocated on the heap, and therefore unreachable by garbage collection roots. During user-provided event handling callbacks, if the listeners are removed/unregistered and garbage collection is forced, the jsvals in the vector become dangling pointers, resulting in a use-after-free condition.
- This vulnerability was identified by security researcher "regenrecht" via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
- The issue is fixed by updating Firefox to version 18, Firefox ESR to 10.0.12 and 17.0.2, SeaMonkey to 2.15, and Thunderbird to 17.0.2.
- Red Hat, openSUSE and Ubuntu have released security updates to address this vulnerability
- Mozilla has assigned the identifier MFSA 2013-17 to this vulnerability
