Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free error in the `InsertElement` function within Internet Explorer. This occurs when the browser attempts to access a memory location that has already been freed (deleted), leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that the `InsertElement` function attempts to access an object in memory after it has been deallocated. This is a classic memory management error that can be exploited for malicious purposes.
 
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the user running Internet Explorer. This could lead to complete system compromise, allowing attackers to install malware, steal data, or take full control of the affected system.
 
**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker can create a malicious webpage that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability when viewed with Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can also inject the exploit code into compromised websites or websites hosting user-generated content, where the victim may unknowingly browse.
- **Email/Instant Messages:** Attackers can distribute links to malicious websites via email or instant messages. They could also include the malicious content directly as an attachment in an email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker doesn't need to be on the local network or have any credentials on the victim's system.
- **Ability to Host a Website or Send Emails:** The attacker needs the ability to host a specially crafted website or send emails that convince users to interact with the exploit.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand the specific way the `InsertElement` function is vulnerable in order to craft the exploit successfully.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as **Critical** on client versions of Windows and **Moderate** on server versions.
- This is one of multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities addressed in the same Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS13-009).
- The update fixes the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The provided content also includes mitigation steps, workarounds and FAQs.
