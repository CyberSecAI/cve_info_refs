# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-21 23:46:20 UTC  ``` Sumit Bose discovered that FreeIPA's directory server (dirsrv) would segfault if an unauthenicated user attempted to connect to it with a missing username/dn.  According to RFC 3062, connecting without specifying the username/dn is valid.   Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Sumit Bose of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-22 17:33:03 UTC  ``` The root of this issue is in the 389 directory server, which FreeIPA also contains, so this affects both 389 and FreeIPA.  This issue only affects FreeIPA 3.1 and 389-ds 1.3.x; earlier versions do not have the vulnerable code.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c3)  Sumit Bose    2013-02-26 11:31:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 702805](attachment.cgi?id=702805&action=diff "Patch for the reported issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=702805&action=edit "Patch for the reported issue") Patch for the reported issue  With the attached patch 0001-Return-an-error-if-a-backend-does-not-support-transa.patch against 389-ds-base the issue is gone with an un-patched version for FreeIPA (freeipa-server-3.1.2-1.fc18).  I'm not sure if with the patch above a patch from FreeIPA is needed as well. Because the only drawback for FreeIPA is that no transaction is used for the password change because an error is returned by slapi_back_transaction_begin(). But since the transaction was introduced in FreeIPA 3.1, is means we just fall back to the previous behavior.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c4)  Rich Megginson    2013-02-26 14:25:19 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 702805](attachment.cgi?id=702805&action=diff "Patch for the reported issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=702805&action=edit "Patch for the reported issue") Patch for the reported issue  nack - LDAP_NO_SUCH_OPERATION is only supposed to be used with the LDAP Cancel operation.  Where is this code called from in ipa?  Should this even be an error?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c5)  Sumit Bose    2013-02-26 17:49:04 UTC  ``` I'm not sure what would be the right error code here, but I think the caller should get some feedback if transactions are not available. It looks like e.g. dblayer_plugin_begin() just returns -1 in case of an error, would this be a better return code?  FreeIPA calls slapi_back_transaction_begin() in the block starting at <http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/freeipa.git/tree/daemons/ipa-slapi-plugins/ipa-pwd-extop/ipa_pwd_extop.c#n244> . In the case described in [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c1) dn is NULL hence the default backend is used, which does not support transaction. In the FreeIPA code this block must be moved down a bit after the input parameters are checked.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c6)  Rich Megginson    2013-02-26 17:54:06 UTC  ``` There are at least 2 exceptional return cases from slapi_back_transaction_begin: 1) backend does not support transactions 2) a hard error (out of resources, etc.)  In the case of 1, this could happen if someone is trying to use the cn=config tree for users.  This is possible in 389, I don't know if ipa allows this.  In that case, it might be better to return some error code e.g. SLAPI_BACK_TRANSACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED rather than a "hard" error code.  ipa might want to allow the operation to proceed in that case, without a transaction.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c7)  Sumit Bose    2013-03-07 11:08:28 UTC  ``` Sorry for the delay, got distracted.  I'm fine with changing the error code to SLAPI_BACK_TRANSACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED, the more specific the better. Currently FreeIPA ignores all kind of errors related to transactions and continues without them.  FreeIPA does not allow to put users into cn=config, the seqfault here was triggered by a missing DN (see [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c1)) which lead to the use of the default backend, which does not support transactions. While this is clearly an error on the FreeIPA side I think it should be fixed on the dirsrv side as well to make it harder in future to trigger seqfaults.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c8)  Rich Megginson    2013-03-07 15:33:49 UTC  ``` Is there a bug open against 389-ds-base?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c9)  Nathan Kinder    2013-03-07 17:41:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c8)) > Is there a bug open against 389-ds-base?  I haven't seen one.  It seems like the 389 DS side changes should be created as an upstream ticket, as it's not a security issue.  The security issue seems to be on the IPA side, though we can make changes in 389 DS to be less error prone for plug-in writers.  If this sounds OK to Vincent and Sumit, I can file the upstream ticket for 389 DS.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c10)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-13 16:51:43 UTC  ``` That depends.  It's not a security flaw on the 389 side, so this change is just to the error code being returned there?  If that's the case and doesn't mention anything about IPA, I'm ok with opening up an upstream bug just to change the error code.  If it's described as anything vaguely security-related, we should wait until this is fixed in IPA/FreeIPA first, or at least coordinate the fix between the two so that they go public together.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c12)  Sumit Bose    2013-03-15 17:32:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 710779](attachment.cgi?id=710779&action=diff "Patch for the FreeIPA side of the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=710779&action=edit "Patch for the FreeIPA side of the issue") Patch for the FreeIPA side of the issue   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c13)  Rob Crittenden    2013-03-15 18:07:20 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 710779](attachment.cgi?id=710779&action=diff "Patch for the FreeIPA side of the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=710779&action=edit "Patch for the FreeIPA side of the issue") Patch for the FreeIPA side of the issue  Tested ldappasswd: - user setting own password using simple auth - admin changing user password using GSSAPI - setting password anonymously (failed gracefully)  Also confirmed that ipa passwd works, and kinit of a reset password resets it correctly.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c14)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-18 18:23:40 UTC  ``` CRD is set for March 26th.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=913751#c16)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-23 21:28:01 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
