Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-0305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Django admin interface's history log did not perform proper permission checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The history view allowed any user with access to the admin interface to view the history of any object accessible in the admin interface, regardless of their specific permissions for that object. This means that users could potentially view changes to objects they weren't supposed to see.
*   **Information Leakage:** The vulnerability resulted in the exposure of potentially sensitive information through the admin history log, which could include summaries of changes made to objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker, or a malicious insider, with admin access could view object history and data they should not have permission to access, potentially revealing confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Admin Interface Access:**  The attacker needs access to the Django admin interface.
*   **History View:** The attacker would navigate to the history view of an object they are not intended to have full access to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the Django administrative interface.
*   **Admin Access:** The user needed at least some form of admin access to reach the vulnerable component.

In summary, the vulnerability in CVE-2013-0305 was caused by missing access controls in Django's admin history view, allowing any admin user to view all history logs regardless of object permissions, potentially leading to information leakage.
