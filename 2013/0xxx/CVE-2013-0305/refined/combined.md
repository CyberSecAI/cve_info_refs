## Security releases issued

Posted by **James Bennett** on Feb. 19, 2013

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.3.6,
Django 1.4.4, and Django 1.5 release candidate 2 -- as part of our
security process.

These releases remedy multiple issues reported to us, and involve
**one important end-user-visible change**, so please read these notes
carefully.

#### Summary

These security releases fix four issues: one potential [phishing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phishing) vector,
one [denial-of-service](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denial_of_Service) vector, an [information leakage](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Information_Leakage) issue, and [a range of XML vulnerabilities](https://bitbucket.org/tiran/defusedxml#external-entity-expansion-remote).

Here's a brief summary of each issue and its resolution:

* [Issue: Host header poisoning](#s-issue-host-header-poisoning): an attacker could cause Django to
  generate and display URLs that link to arbitrary domains. This could
  be used as part of a phishing attack. These releases fix this
  problem by introducing a new setting, [ALLOWED\_HOSTS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts), which specifies
  a whitelist of domains your site is known to respond to.

  **Important:** by default Django 1.3.6 and 1.4.4 set [ALLOWED\_HOSTS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts) to
  allow all hosts. This means that to actually fix the
  security vulnerability you should define this setting yourself
  immediately after upgrading.
* [Issue: Formset denial-of-service](#s-issue-formset-denial-of-service): an attacker can abuse Django's
  tracking of the number of forms in a formset to cause a
  denial-of-service attack. This has been fixed by adding a default
  maximum number of forms of 1,000. You can still manually specify a
  bigger max\_num, if you wish, but 1,000 should be enough for anyone.
* [Issue: XML attacks](#s-issue-xml-attacks): Django's serialization
  framework was vulnerable to attacks via XML
  entity expansion and external references; this is now
  fixed. However, if you're parsing arbitrary XML in other parts of
  your application, we recommend you look into [the defusedxml Python
  packages](http://blog.python.org/2013/02/announcing-defusedxml-fixes-for-xml.html) which remedy this anywhere you parse XML, not just via
  Django's serialization framework.
* [Issue: Data leakage via admin history log](#s-issue-data-leakage-via-admin-history-log): Django's admin
  interface could expose supposedly-hidden information via its history
  log. This has been fixed.

For more details, read on.

#### Issue: Host header poisoning

Several previous Django security releases have attempted to address
persistent issues with the HTTP Host header. Django
contains code -- and some functionality shipped with Django itself
makes use of that code -- for constructing a fully-qualified URL based
on the incoming HTTP request. Depending on configuration, this makes
use of the Host header, and so an attacker who can cause
a Django application to respond to arbitrary Host headers
can cause Django to generate, and display to end users, URLs on
arbitrary domains.

Previous iterations of this issue (see CVE-2011-4139 and
CVE-2012-4520) have focused on tightening Django's parsing of
Host headers, to eliminate various means by which
attackers -- using techniques such as username/password pairs in their
submitted Host header -- could exploit this.

Ultimately, however, Django alone cannot ensure that an attacker is
unable to submit, and cause Django to accept, arbitrary
Host headers. Properly securing this in a deployed Django
instance additionally requires configuration of the web server, and
both the configuration and the achievable level of security vary with
the server being used.

In light of this, the get\_host() method of
django.http.HttpRequest will now validate the
Host header against a new setting,
[ALLOWED\_HOSTS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts). This setting is a list of strings (by
default, an empty list) corresponding to acceptable values for the
header, with some support for wildcards.

Code which does not use get\_host(), or Django
configurations which can determine the current hostname without
recourse to HTTP headers (i.e., when Django's sites framework is
enabled) will not be affected by this change.

Since this is hardening/tightening of a previous issue, it does not
have a new CVE number.

#### Issue: XML attacks

Django's serialization framework includes support for serializing to,
and deserializing from, XML. Django's XML deserialization is
vulnerable to entity-expansion and external-entity/DTD attacks.

To remedy this, Django's XML deserializer no longer allows DTDs, performs entity
expansion, or fetches external entities/DTDs. Note
that this only protects Django's XML serialization framework; if your
application parses XML, we recommend you look into [the defusedxml
Python packages](http://blog.python.org/2013/02/announcing-defusedxml-fixes-for-xml.html) which remedy this for Python itself.

Because this issue also affects Python's XML libraries, it is covered
by Python's CVE-2013-1664 and CVE-2013-1665.

#### Issue: Data leakage via admin history log

Django's bundled administrative interface keeps a log of actions
taken, preserving the history of any object which is exposed through
the admin interface. This history view does not perform any permission
checks beyond confirming that the user has access to the
administrative interface; as such, any user with admin access can view
the history of any object accessible in the admin interface, and see
summaries of each change made to an object.

To remedy this, the admin history view for an object will now perform
the same permission checks as other admin views for the same object.

This issue is CVE-2013-0305.

#### Issue: Formset denial-of-service

Django's form library includes tools for generating formsets --
multiple instances of a single form, to be submitted simultaneously
(e.g., for mass editing/updating of similar objects). Formsets allow a
parameter, max\_num, specifying the maximum number of individual
forms which may be displayed. A hidden input in the formset then
specifies the number of forms being submitted.

Django accepts the submitted hidden value, and attempts to instantiate
that many form objects. Sufficiently large values will result in
extreme memory consumption; values exceeding sys.maxint will, in
this case, result in an HTTP 500 response (due to an uncaught
OverflowError from the over-large value). In the former case, the
result is an effective denial-of-service attack. In the latter, an
attacker can cause arbitrary server errors.

To resolve this, Django will now supply a (suitably large) default
value for the maximum number of forms, which will be used when
max\_num is not supplied. Application developers can still manually
specify max\_num to suit the needs of their applications, but
absent this the default value -- 1000 -- will ensure that attackers
cannot cause overflow errors or excessive memory consumption.

This issue is CVE-2013-0306.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=913042#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-20 09:31:17 UTC  ```  James Bennett of Django reports:  Django's form library includes tools for generating formsets -- multiple instances of a single form, to be submitted simultaneously (e.g., for mass editing/updating of similar objects). Formsets allow a parameter, max_num, specifying the maximum number of individual forms which may be displayed. A hidden input in the formset then specifies the number of forms being submitted.  Django accepts the submitted hidden value, and attempts to instantiate that many form objects. Sufficiently large values will result in extreme memory consumption; values exceeding sys.maxint will, in this case, result in an HTTP 500 response (due to an uncaught OverflowError from the over-large value). In the former case, the result is an effective denial-of-service attack. In the latter, an attacker can cause arbitrary server errors.  To resolve this, Django will now supply a (suitably large) default value for the maximum number of forms, which will be used when max_num is not supplied. Application developers can still manually specify max_num to suit the needs of their applications, but absent this the default value -- 1000 -- will ensure that attackers cannot cause overflow errors or excessive memory consumption.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0670)

## Topic

Updated Django packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Django web framework is used by Horizon, the OpenStack Dashboard, which
is a web interface for managing OpenStack services.

A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
parser used by Django. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
specially-crafted request to an Horizon API, causing Horizon to consume an
excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Django. If a remote attacker
sent a specially-crafted request to an Horizon API, it could cause Horizon
to connect to external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or
allow an attacker to read files on the Horizon server that are accessible
to the user running Horizon. (CVE-2013-1665)

It was found that the history view in the bundled administrative web
interface in Django did not perform permission checks. An authenticated
user who can access the web interface could use this flaw to view the
changes to objects and data they would otherwise not have access to.
(CVE-2013-0305)

A flaw was found in the way Django handled formsets. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to submit a large number of forms, causing excessive
memory consumption. Note: The current version of OpenStack in Red Hat
OpenStack Folsom does not expose this vulnerability. (CVE-2013-0306)

This update also includes two hardening fixes to help protect against XML
entity and HTTP Host header poisoning attacks. (BZ#913039, BZ#913037)

All users of Horizon are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which resolve these issues. After installing the updated packages, the
httpd daemon must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for the update to
take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=913041#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-20 09:29:08 UTC  ```  James Bennett of Django reports:  Django's bundled administrative interface keeps a log of actions taken, preserving the history of any object which is exposed through the admin interface. This history view does not perform any permission checks beyond confirming that the user has access to the administrative interface; as such, any user with admin access can view the history of any object accessible in the admin interface, and see summaries of each change made to an object.  To remedy this, the admin history view for an object will now perform the same permission checks as other admin views for the same object.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=913039#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-20 09:26:20 UTC  ```  James Bennett of Django reports:  Django's serialization framework includes support for serializing to, and deserializing from, XML. Django's XML deserialization is vulnerable to entity-expansion and external-entity/DTD attacks.  To remedy this, Django's XML deserializer no longer allows DTDs, performs entity expansion, or fetches external entities/DTDs. Note that this only protects Django's XML serialization framework; if your application parses XML, we recommend you look into the defusedxml Python packages which remedy this for Python itself.  Because this issue also affects Python's XML libraries, it is covered by Python's [CVE-2013-1664](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1664) and [CVE-2013-1665](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1665).

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ€™ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâ€™s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâ€™s CVE database.

When a technologyâ€”enabled and most likely used by defaultâ€”completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# USN-1757-1: Django vulnerabilities

7 March 2013

Several security issues were fixed in Django.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

James Kettle discovered that Django did not properly filter the Host HTTP

header when processing certain requests. An attacker could exploit this to

generate and display arbitrary URLs to users. Although this issue had been

previously addressed in USN-1632-1, this update adds additional hardening

measures to host header validation. This update also adds a new

ALLOWED\_HOSTS setting that can be set to a list of acceptable values for

headers. ([CVE-2012-4520](/security/CVE-2012-4520))

Orange Tsai discovered that Django incorrectly performed permission checks

when displaying the history view in the admin interface. An administrator

could use this flaw to view the history of any object, regardless of

intended permissions. ([CVE-2013-0305](/security/CVE-2013-0305))

It was discovered that Django incorrectly handled a large number of forms

when generating formsets. An attacker could use this flaw to cause Django

to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-0306](/security/CVE-2013-0306))

It was discovered that Django incorrectly deserialized XML. An attacker

could use this flaw to perform entity-expansion and external-entity/DTD

attacks. This updated modified Django behaviour to no longer allow DTDs,

perform entity expansion, or fetch external entities/DTDs. ([CVE-2013-1664](/security/CVE-2013-1664),

[CVE-2013-1665](/security/CVE-2013-1665))

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django)
  -
  [1.4.1-2ubuntu0.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django/1.4.1-2ubuntu0.3)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django)
  -
  [1.3.1-4ubuntu1.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django/1.3.1-4ubuntu1.6)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django)
  -
  [1.3-2ubuntu1.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django/1.3-2ubuntu1.6)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

  -
  [1.1.1-2ubuntu1.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django/1.1.1-2ubuntu1.8)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Debian Bug     : 701186 696535 691145

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in python-django, a high-level
python web development framework.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2012-4520

    James Kettle discovered that django did not properly filter the HTTP
    Host header when processing certain requests. An attacker could exploit
    this to generate and cause parts of django, particularly the
    password-reset mechanism, to display arbitrary URLs to users.

CVE-2013-0305

    Orange Tsai discovered that the bundled administrative interface
    of django could expose supposedly-hidden information via its history
    log.

CVE-2013-0306

    Mozilla discovered that an attacker can abuse django's tracking of
    the number of forms in a formset to cause a denial-of-service attack
    due to extreme memory consumption.

CVE-2013-1665

    Michael Koziarski discovered that django's XML deserialization is
    vulnerable to entity-expansion and external-entity/DTD attacks.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
