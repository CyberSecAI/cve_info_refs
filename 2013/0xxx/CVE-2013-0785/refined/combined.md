This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.

# 4.4rc1, 4.2.4, 4.0.9, and 3.6.12 Security Advisory

Tuesday, Feb 19th, 2013
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* When viewing a bug report, a bug ID containing random code is not
  correctly sanitized in the HTML page if the specified page format
  is invalid. This can lead to XSS.

* When running a query in debug mode, it is possible to determine if
  a given confidential field value (such as a product name) exists.
  Bugzilla 4.1 and newer are not affected by this issue.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.0 to 3.6.12, 3.7.1 to 4.0.9, 4.1.1 to 4.2.4, 4.3.1 to 4.4rc1
Fixed In:    3.6.13, 4.0.10, 4.2.5, 4.4rc2
Description: When viewing a single bug report, which is the default,
             the bug ID is validated and rejected if it is invalid.
             But when viewing several bug reports at once, which is
             specified by the format=multiple parameter, invalid bug
             IDs can go through and are sanitized in the HTML page
             itself. But when an invalid page format is passed to the
             CGI script, the wrong HTML page is called and data are not
             correctly sanitized, which can lead to XSS.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=842038
CVE Number:  CVE-2013-0785

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    2.17.1 to 3.6.12, 3.7.1 to 4.0.9
Fixed In:    3.6.13, 4.0.10
Description: When running a query in debug mode, the generated SQL
             query used to collect the data is displayed. The way this
             SQL query is built permits the user to determine if some
             confidential field value (such as a product name) exists.
             This problem only affects Bugzilla 4.0.9 and older. Newer
             releases are not affected by this issue.

CVE Number:  CVE-2013-0786

Bugzilla 3.6, 4.0 and 4.2 throws:
Insecure dependency in parameter 3 of DBI::db=HASH(0xa196540)->selectcol\_arrayref method call while running with -T switch
This error should not happen but at least there is no XSS.
For 4.4 and trunk, XSS is triggered, but only if JavaScript is enabled. I'm on it!Assignee: create-and-change → LpSolitStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Blimey... how on earth did we let this through? :-|
Not only is it a problem, it's a problem in about 5 places. It's in the title, various <link rel=""> places and the header text.
And why does it work on BMO if 3.6, 4.0 and 4.2 throw?

Because bmo probably has some extensions which blindly trust the bug ID and do not filter it.

There are tons of places in templates where the bug ID is assumed to be an integer, i.e. something safe which you don't need to filter. Rather than fixing all these places individually, and taking the risk to miss some of them, or to rely on localizers to filter all these places themselves, I'm going to force show\_bug.cgi to filter invalid bug IDs itself. This is much safer. And I honestly don't care if there are some places which already filter the bug ID themselves, resulting in double escaping.

Attached patch

[patch for 4.4 and trunk, v1](attachment.cgi?id=714823&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=714823&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=842038&attachment=714823)

Actually, the problem is that show\_bug.cgi looks at the 'format' and 'ctype' parameters entered by the user \*before\* they are validated. Bugzilla::Template::get\_format() detects that they are invalid and sanitized them, meaning that it will fall back to the default "show single bug" page, but show\_bug.cgi already looked at them to decide how to display data. What this means is that show\_bug.cgi thinks that the invalid bug will be passed to the "show multiple bugs" page, which correctly filters everything because it knows it can get untrusted data, but in fact Bugzilla::Template will use the classic "show single bug" page, which expects to get a valid bug object and so trust the bug ID.
So my fix is to make show\_bug.cgi use sanitized data from get\_format() so that it correctly calls Bugzilla::Bug->check() if the "show single bug" page is going to be called. This patch is for 4.4 and trunk.

I found the reason: if your installation has a custom multi-select field, you are lucky enough and get the DBI error I pasted in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=842038#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] XSS in show_bug.cgi when using an invalid page format") before XSS is triggered. If you have no custom multi-select field, then XSS is triggered, even on the branches above. So in fact all versions are vulnerable to this XSS issue (I can reproduce with 2.22, all 3.x and 4.x versions, and 5.0; I know no older installations).

Let's be a bit more proactive and throw an error if the format or ctype arguments contain unexpected characters. It doesn't make sense to sanitize them by removing unwanted characters. Either format and ctype have the expected syntax, or they are invalid. Period.
For 4.2 and older, I'm not sure we should enforce this rule in case this breaks some customizations.

> Security advisory sent. Removing sec flag.
I really don't understand why the sec flag is removed the moment the advisory is sent out to your announce list. This leaves us unsuspecting admins vulnerable and exposed.
I think it would be a greater service to your community if you announced the release and linked to the CVE, which does not necessarily point out how easily this is issue is exploitable, and remove the sec flag after a reasonable amount of time.

Bugzilla admins are supposed to subscribe to the announce mailing-list, where announcements and security advisories are sent to. So "unsuspecting admins" doesn't stand here. Also, patches are attached to the security bug itself, so leaving the bug restricted to the security team only wouldn't let admins download patches if they don't want to or don't have the time to do a full upgrade but only want to patch the security issue. I also announce new releases on Google+ and on my blog, which is mirrored on planet.bugzilla.org, which are other ways to get info about Bugzilla. And finally, all new releases are pre-announced if you CC yourself to the meta [bug 286269](/show_bug.cgi?id=286269 "NEW - Bugzilla Release Tracking") which exists since 2005 to let admins know that new releases are coming soon.

We \*always\* announce the releases to the community, and we always did. As I said above, announcements are sent to the announce mailing-list, but also to the support mailing-list. Moreover, security advisories are also sent to BugTraq.
And for your reminder, we did CC you and other Bugzilla admins to very critical security bugs while they were still restricted, such as [bug 515191](/show_bug.cgi?id=515191 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] SQL Injection via Bug.search (CVE-2009-3125) and Bug.create (CVE-2009-3165)") and [bug 621591](/show_bug.cgi?id=621591 "RESOLVED FIXED - Critical Security Issue In Bugzilla Since 2.14: Early-Access Patch"). For [bug 515191](/show_bug.cgi?id=515191 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] SQL Injection via Bug.search (CVE-2009-3125) and Bug.create (CVE-2009-3165)"), we waited for your confirmation that your Bugzilla installation was patched before making the security fix and the bug itself public. For [bug 621591](/show_bug.cgi?id=621591 "RESOLVED FIXED - Critical Security Issue In Bugzilla Since 2.14: Early-Access Patch"), you got access to a fix one month before anyone else, and the original security bug with all the details of the vulnerability became public only 6 months later (that was [bug 619594](/show_bug.cgi?id=619594 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Tokens generated from weak source of randomness, allowing an attacker to guess a password change token and change the password of any account")). So I think we take care of security bugs and announcements pretty seriously.

Frederic, I think you misread my previous comment.
I did not make this statement: "you do not announce releases"
I made this statement: "Removing the security flag on security bugs at the same time you make the announcement that there is a flaw exposes the install base".
Since the security bugs often contain details on the exact procedure to exploit, my suggestion is to simply delay the removal of the security flag for a reasonable amount of time. This would allow admins to react to the announcement that there is a flaw.
As for obtaining the patches, surely they can be made available for download by other means than this bug.
This comment is simply an attempt at providing feedback on the current process. FWIW, I am subscribed to the announce, and David's email is sitting in my inbox and tagged as "things to do ASAP". Unfortunately, $DAY\_JOB = ($Bugzilla + @OTHER\_STUFF) / $SMALL\_TEAM.

I think this is a reasonable request.
I believe the security policy for Firefox implements a delay between releasing a fixed build and opening the bugs in question. dveditz: can you fill us in on what it is?
From what Frederic said, the only reason I can see for opening the bug straight away is to give people access to the patches if they don't want to do a full upgrade. Can we find some other way of making patches available if we think people actually do use them?
