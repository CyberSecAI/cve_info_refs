Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of the 'format' and 'ctype' parameters in the `show_bug.cgi` script when viewing bug reports. The script checks these parameters before validating them, leading to a mismatch in expected behavior. Specifically, if an invalid format is provided, the script prepares to display a "multiple bugs" view which sanitizes input. However, the invalid format is later sanitized by `Bugzilla::Template::get_format()`, which then defaults to showing a "single bug" view instead. This single bug view expects a valid bug object and doesn't sanitize the bug ID, thus leading to the XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. By injecting malicious code into the `id` parameter of `show_bug.cgi` when using an invalid format parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser.
- Inadequate Input Validation: The script fails to properly validate user-provided parameters *before* using them to determine the page format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the user's browser session.
- Session hijacking: The attacker could steal session cookies and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Defacement or Malicious Actions: The attacker could redirect users to malicious sites, change the content of the page, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URL: An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious bug ID and invalid format parameters and induces a user to visit it.
   Example: `https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27TurbanatorSJS%27%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&format=123`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with an invalid bug ID and invalid format or ctype parameters.
- The attacker must lure a Bugzilla user to visit the malicious URL via email, social engineering or other means.

**Additional Details**
- Bugzilla versions 1.0 through 5.0 (and possibly later versions) are affected by the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is exploitable in all Bugzilla versions, as there are many places that assume the bug ID to be an integer, making filtering difficult to implement.
- The fix involves forcing `show_bug.cgi` to use sanitized data from `Bugzilla::Template::get_format()` to correctly call `Bugzilla::Bug->check()` if the "show single bug" page is called.
- Patches for various versions were created to address the issue, including stricter input validation for format and ctype parameters for trunk versions.
