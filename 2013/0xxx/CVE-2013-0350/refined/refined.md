Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-0350:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a debugging feature left in the `pktstat` tool. Specifically, the `tmp_smtp.c` file contains code that writes content from sniffed TCP streams to a fixed file path `/tmp/smtp.log`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable File Path:** The log file is always created at `/tmp/smtp.log`, making it vulnerable to symlink attacks.
*   **World Readable File:** The created log file has default permissions that make it world-readable, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Unbounded Log Size:** If the application is run for extended periods on a busy network, the log file can grow large, potentially filling the `/tmp` directory or even the root partition.
*  **Leftover Debug Code**: The logging functionality was intended for debugging and was not meant to be included in the released version.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite (Symlink Attack):** An attacker can create a symbolic link named `/tmp/smtp.log` pointing to a file they want to overwrite. When `pktstat` runs, it will write debugging information to the target file via the symbolic link. This could lead to system instability or data loss.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The log file may contain sensitive data from network traffic, such as email content, user credentials or other application data.
*  **Denial of Service**:  The log file can grow to fill up the tmp directory leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system where `pktstat` is running.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker creates a symbolic link at /tmp/smtp.log before `pktstat` is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `pktstat` is installed.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create a symlink in the /tmp directory.
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute the `pktstat` program, or be able to cause it to be executed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in `pktstat` version 1.8.5-2 and fixed in version 1.8.5-3.
*   The fix involved removing the debugging log writing functionality entirely.
*   The bug was reported on Debian bug tracker and assigned CVE-2013-0350.
