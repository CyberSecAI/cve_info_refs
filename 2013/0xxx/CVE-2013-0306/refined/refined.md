{
  "cveId": "CVE-2013-0306",
  "description": "Mozilla discovered that an attacker can abuse django's tracking of the number of forms in a formset to cause a denial-of-service attack due to extreme memory consumption.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Django's formset handling did not limit the number of forms that could be submitted, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrarily large number of forms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded resource allocation",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to excessive memory consumption, potentially leading to server crashes or instability. Can also cause an uncaught OverflowError, resulting in an HTTP 500 response.",
    "attackVector": "Remote, through a crafted HTTP request.",
     "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a Django application that uses formsets. No authentication is required.",
     "position": "The attacker can be an external user."
  },
   "fixes": [
     "Django now supplies a default value for the maximum number of forms, limiting the amount of memory that can be consumed. The default is set to 1000, but application developers can still manually specify `max_num` as needed."
   ]
