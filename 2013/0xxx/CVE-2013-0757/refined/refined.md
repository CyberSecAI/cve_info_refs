    {
      "id": "813901",
      "summary": "Chrome Object Wrapper can be bypassed using Object.prototype.__proto__",
      "details": "It is possible to change the prototype of an object wrapped in a cross-compartment wrapper if the setter of Object.prototype.__proto__ is called in the context of the wrapper. This can be used against chrome objects that don't explicitly define __exposedProps__ to gain access to privileged methods. This bug appears to have been introduced in Firefox 17, the earlier versions don't have accessors on __proto__." ,
    "vulnerabilityDetails": {
       "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to modify the prototype of an object wrapped by a cross-compartment wrapper. This is achieved by calling the setter of `Object.prototype.__proto__` within the wrapper's context. Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) did not properly prevent this action.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect handling of prototype modifications on wrapped objects",
          "Insufficient checks on the origin of `__exposedProps__`",
          "Bypass of Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) security mechanisms"
        ],
        "impact": "By modifying the prototype of a wrapped object, an attacker could gain access to privileged methods intended for chrome objects. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "Manipulation of `Object.prototype.__proto__` within the context of a wrapped object",
           "Use of  cross-compartment wrappers to execute code in a higher privilege context."
        ],
        "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in a web context, possibly through a crafted web page or a malicious extension. Exploiting this flaw requires manipulating the prototype chain of a wrapped object and the ability to access privileged methods."
