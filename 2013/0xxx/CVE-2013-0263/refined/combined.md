Hash: SHA1

Hello,

Today we are proud to announce the release of Rack 1.1.6.

= Rack, a modular Ruby webserver interface

Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called middleware) into a single method call.

The exact details of this are described in the Rack specification, which all Rack applications should conform to.

== Changes

\* February 7th, Thirty fifth public release 1.1.6, 1.2.8, 1.3.10

 \* Fix CVE-2013-0263, timing attack against Rack::Session::Cookie

== Where can I get it?

You can download Rack at

 <http://chneukirchen.org/releases/rack-1.1.6.tar.gz> (upload pending at time of writing)

 <http://rubyforge.org/projects/rack>

Alternatively, you can checkout from the development repository with:

 git clone git://[github.com/rack/rack.git](http://github.com/rack/rack.git)

cd rack && git checkout rack-1.1 # for this release

Happy hacking and have a nice day,

James Tucker

on behalf of the Rack Core Team.

CVE ID         : CVE-2011-5036 CVE-2013-0184 CVE-2013-0263
Debian Bug     : 653963 698440 700226

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Rack, a modular Ruby
webserver interface. The Common Vulnerabilites and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2011-5036

    Rack computes hash values for form parameters without restricting
    the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
    by sending many crafted parameters.

CVE-2013-0184

    Vulnerability in Rack::Auth::AbstractRequest allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-0263

    Rack::Session::Cookie allows remote attackers to guess the
    session cookie, gain privileges, and execute arbitrary code via a
    timing attack involving am HMAC comparison function that does not
    run in constant time.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0-4+squeeze1.

The stable, testing and unstable distributions do not contain the
librack-ruby package. They have already been addressed in version
1.4.1-2.1 of the ruby-rack package.

We recommend that you upgrade your librack-ruby packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=909528#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-09 08:37:19 UTC  ```  Aaron Patterson (tenderlove) reports:  Circumvention of attr_protected  There is a vulnerability in the attr_protected method in ActiveRecord. This  vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2013-0276](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0276).  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       Applications using attr_accessible Fixed Versions:     3.2.12, 3.1.11  Impact  ------ The attr_protected method allows developers to specify a blacklist of model  attributes which users should not be allowed to assign to.  By using a  specially crafted request, attackers could circumvent this protection and  alter values that were meant to be protected.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the  work arounds immediately.  Users should also consider switching from  attr_protected to the whitelist method attr_accessible which is not vulnerable  to this attack.  Releases  --------  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.   Workarounds  -----------  The only feasible work around for this issue is to convert the application to  use attr_accessible instead of attr_protected.  Patches  -------  To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches  for the two supported release series.

In theory, this is true.  However, I think the "fix" is worse than the
actual issue.
Remember that Rack::Session::Cookie uses SHA1, which generates 40-char
hexdigests.
This already reduces the possibility of a timing attack, because a
40-char comparison
is very fast (on this 3ghz P4 here):

10M a == b => true takes 9.7s here
10M a == b => false takes 8.7s here (first char different.)

Since only a single comparison is made, this equals to measuring 10
microseconds,
which is impractical over the network etc. and vanishes in sight of
the other code running anyway.
(Instantiating Rack::Request, the actual HTTP call, etc.)

On invalid HMACs the session data is cleared immediately.

Rails' secure_compare is 100x slower.

I welcome discussion on this issue.

No, that's within reach of a practical attack over the internet, and
certainly over a LAN.

I would wager that this form of statistical analysis will not get harder to=

Unless you begin to block the client's IP, that's not an effective
countermeasure. Eventually the attacker will discover all 40 bytes of
the HMAC and have a valid session, regardless of how many previous
attempts were discarded.

> Rails' secure_compare is 100x slower.

Yes, it is slower. I made no attempt to optimize it when I wrote it,
so I'm sure it can be improved. (In theory, you can make it as fast as
the strcmp of a valid HMAC.)

But if your comparison function takes less time to compare an HMAC
which has a bad last byte than it does to compare an HMAC which is
correct, you leave yourself (and all the users of Rack, whether they
know it or not) vulnerable to timing attacks.

Yes.  Some ideas on doing a comparsion that is fast and not exploitable:

  (a.to_i(16) ^ b.to_i(16)).zero?

.zero? runs in constant time, to actually force ^ to do full 160-bit
operations, maybe one needs:

  ((a.to_i(16) | 2<<161) ^ (b.to_i(16) | 2<<161)).zero?

Comments?

It's an interesting idea, but this won't work either.

The internal representation of "00000000000000000000" as a Bignum will
be smaller than the internal representation of "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF":

    >> ("F" * 20).to_i(16).size
    =3D> 12
    >> ("0" * 20).to_i(16).size
    =3D> 8

Because both rb_cstr_to_inum() and rb_big_xor() call bignorm() on the
resulting values, neither the xor nor the zero check are constant-time
operations. I think this approach would defeat a simple byte-by-byte
attack, but it would still be vulnerable to more mathematically
sophisticated attacks, along the lines of Brumley and Boneh's RSA
attack[1].

Are any of these attacks practically viable after running through a ruby =
VM and other rack operations?

Sorry, the viability of these attacks would require that 'background =
noise' is less significant than the timing issue. Ruby, being a VHLL, =
has certain factors (even on faster / smaller implementations) that make =
some of these things extremely difficult, possibly provably impossible, =
especially on current interpreters and hardware.

That's not the case.

The Java security team recently patched a timing attack I reported to
them about exactly the same thing --
<http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/6u17.html> -- and the JVM is
substantially more complex in terms of runtime characteristics.

Nate Lawson found a similar vulnerability in Keyczar, a cryptographic
library for Python and Java --
<http://groups.google.com/group/keyczar-discuss/browse_thread/thread/5571ec=
a0948b2a13/7d0f902722a520d9?lnk=3Dgst>
-- and Python's VM is on the same order of complexity as Ruby's.

It doesn't matter if the application runs on machine code, inside a
VM, or inside a JIT-optimizing VM. It doesn't matter if it allocates
20 bytes of memory or 200 MB. All that matters is that whatever
portion of that time is spent verifying the HMAC can be correlated
with the contents of the HMAC.

Given that information, the rest is just a matter of sample size and analys=
is.

Sorry, I had more of a read, and a think about how the exploit would be =
implemented, and it started to make more sense how the variation from =
other portions of the system becomes insignificant over a sufficient =
sample size; sorry for the noise.

With regard to the fix, it's an unfortunate penalty we're going to have =
to pay, and might be something we should consider asking for in ruby.

You have my sympathies, and I'd support a better HMAC library for
Ruby. All of the timing attacks involving HMACs that I've seen are the
direct consequence of standard libraries treating the MAC as a string
or array of bytes as opposed to an object or data type in its own
right, with specific semantics like constant-time comparison. It's a
failure of encapsulation.

How do you know a future ruby implementation will not optimize this in a "return early" version again? Could you add a spec that checks for constant runtime? Maybe an integration spec that does a timing analysis? I'd totally accept if rack would depend on the NaCL ruby bindings to delegate constant time comparisons.

I hope this method is not going to be used anywhere. Perhaps I don't understand what it's needed for?

* You can't compare strings in constant time; comparison will always depend on the length of the strings.
* This is probably the most inefficient way to compare two strings. In fact, I don't actually understand what it is accomplishing.

[@headius](https://github.com/headius) this method is used to achieve an almost constant time comparison. See [0cd7e9a](https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/0cd7e9aa397f8ebb3b8481d67dbac8b4863a7f07)

[@mbj](https://github.com/mbj) I am happy to add some tests that make a loose effort at proving at the time is relative to the length of both strings, and doesn't fast exit. The rest of your suggestions and comments are impossible, excessive or odd.

[@headius](https://github.com/headius) sure, the difference with this method is that it will always take time relative to the length of the strings, not relative to the content of the strings. It is constant with respect to varying external content (not length), except for the single (safe) fast exit case of the input being empty(edit: different lengths. i'm tired, and it's the weekend, forgive me). You are absolutely correct, that in algorithmic terminology, this is not constant time as in `O(1)` regardless of the input. In crypto circles, this kind of comparison is generally referred to as "constant time", even though that is a misnomer. A relevant example paper that covers these timing issues can be found here: <http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf>. Timing attacks against HMAC are actually somewhat easier.

It may be true I should handle some encoding details here too, if the method is to be used in a generic fashion. For the current intended use case, where all valid characters are ascii, we do not reveal anything useful in bytesize.

[@headius](https://github.com/headius) what it's trying to accomplish is preventing short-circuiting. The phrase "constant time" is being used in regard to two Message Authentication Codes which are fixed-size. The goal is to have them always compare in constant time. Just using "==" will fail fast on the first byte. If we can measure timing information over the course of many requests and see a "signal" when brute forcing various byte combinations, we can use that signal to determine when we've successfully brute forced a single byte of a MAC. It looks something like this:

It's somewhat analogous to picking a lock. Once you've gotten the first tumbler, you can move on to the next one, and the next one until you've picked them all.

# [Rack](/rack/rack/blob/main/contrib/logo.webp)

Rack provides a minimal, modular, and adaptable interface for developing web
applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in the simplest
way possible, it unifies and distills the bridge between web servers, web
frameworks, and web application into a single method call.

The exact details of this are described in the [Rack Specification](/rack/rack/blob/main/SPEC.rdoc), which all
Rack applications should conform to.

## Version support

| Version | Support |
| --- | --- |
| 3.1.x | Bug fixes and security patches. |
| 3.0.x | Security patches only. |
| 2.2.x | Security patches only. |
| <= 2.1.x | End of support. |

Please see the [Security Policy](/rack/rack/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more information.

## Rack 3.1

This is the latest version of Rack. It contains bug fixes and security patches.
Please check the [Change Log](/rack/rack/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed information on specific
changes.

## Rack 3.0

This version of rack contains significant changes which are detailed in the
[Upgrade Guide](/rack/rack/blob/main/UPGRADE-GUIDE.md). It is recommended to upgrade to Rack 3 as soon
as possible to receive the latest features and security patches.

## Rack 2.2

This version of Rack is receiving security patches only, and effort should be
made to move to Rack 3.

Starting in Ruby 3.4 the `base64` dependency will no longer be a default gem,
and may cause a warning or error about `base64` being missing. To correct this,
add `base64` as a dependency to your project.

## Installation

Add the rack gem to your application bundle, or follow the instructions provided
by a [supported web framework](#supported-web-frameworks):

```
# Install it generally:
$ gem install rack

# or, add it to your current application gemfile:
$ bundle add rack
```

If you need features from `Rack::Session` or `bin/rackup` please add those gems separately.

```
$ gem install rack-session rackup
```

## Usage

Create a file called `config.ru` with the following contents:

```
run do |env|
  [200, {}, ["Hello World"]]
end
```

Run this using the rackup gem or another [supported web
server](#supported-web-servers).

```
$ gem install rackup
$ rackup

# In another shell:
$ curl http://localhost:9292
Hello World
```

## Supported web servers

Rack is supported by a wide range of servers, including:

* [Agoo](https://github.com/ohler55/agoo)
* [Falcon](https://github.com/socketry/falcon)
* [Iodine](https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine)
* [NGINX Unit](https://unit.nginx.org/)
* [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) (which is mod\_rack for
  Apache and for nginx)
* [Pitchfork](https://github.com/Shopify/pitchfork)
* [Puma](https://puma.io/)
* [Thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin)
* [Unicorn](https://yhbt.net/unicorn/)
* [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Lamby](https://lamby.custominktech.com) (for AWS Lambda)

You will need to consult the server documentation to find out what features and
limitations they may have. In general, any valid Rack app will run the same on
all these servers, without changing anything.

### Rackup

Rack provides a separate gem, [rackup](https://github.com/rack/rackup) which is
a generic interface for running a Rack application on supported servers, which
include `WEBRick`, `Puma`, `Falcon` and others.

## Supported web frameworks

These frameworks and many others support the [Rack Specification](/rack/rack/blob/main/SPEC.rdoc):

* [Camping](https://github.com/camping/camping)
* [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/)
* [Ramaze](https://github.com/ramaze/ramaze)
* [Padrino](https://padrinorb.com/)
* [Roda](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Rum](https://github.com/leahneukirchen/rum)
* [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/)
* [Utopia](https://github.com/socketry/utopia)
* [WABuR](https://github.com/ohler55/wabur)

## Available middleware shipped with Rack

Between the server and the framework, Rack can be customized to your
applications needs using middleware. Rack itself ships with the following
middleware:

* `Rack::CommonLogger` for creating Apache-style logfiles.
* `Rack::ConditionalGet` for returning [Not
  Modified](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304)
  responses when the response has not changed.
* `Rack::Config` for modifying the environment before processing the request.
* `Rack::ContentLength` for setting a `content-length` header based on body
  size.
* `Rack::ContentType` for setting a default `content-type` header for responses.
* `Rack::Deflater` for compressing responses with gzip.
* `Rack::ETag` for setting `etag` header on bodies that can be buffered.
* `Rack::Events` for providing easy hooks when a request is received and when
  the response is sent.
* `Rack::Files` for serving static files.
* `Rack::Head` for returning an empty body for HEAD requests.
* `Rack::Lint` for checking conformance to the [Rack Specification](/rack/rack/blob/main/SPEC.rdoc).
* `Rack::Lock` for serializing requests using a mutex.
* `Rack::MethodOverride` for modifying the request method based on a submitted
  parameter.
* `Rack::Recursive` for including data from other paths in the application, and
  for performing internal redirects.
* `Rack::Reloader` for reloading files if they have been modified.
* `Rack::Runtime` for including a response header with the time taken to process
  the request.
* `Rack::Sendfile` for working with web servers that can use optimized file
  serving for file system paths.
* `Rack::ShowException` for catching unhandled exceptions and presenting them in
  a nice and helpful way with clickable backtrace.
* `Rack::ShowStatus` for using nice error pages for empty client error
  responses.
* `Rack::Static` for more configurable serving of static files.
* `Rack::TempfileReaper` for removing temporary files creating during a request.

All these components use the same interface, which is described in detail in the
[Rack Specification](/rack/rack/blob/main/SPEC.rdoc). These optional components can be used in any way you wish.

### Convenience interfaces

If you want to develop outside of existing frameworks, implement your own ones,
or develop middleware, Rack provides many helpers to create Rack applications
quickly and without doing the same web stuff all over:

* `Rack::Request` which also provides query string parsing and multipart
  handling.
* `Rack::Response` for convenient generation of HTTP replies and cookie
  handling.
* `Rack::MockRequest` and `Rack::MockResponse` for efficient and quick testing
  of Rack application without real HTTP round-trips.
* `Rack::Cascade` for trying additional Rack applications if an application
  returns a not found or method not supported response.
* `Rack::Directory` for serving files under a given directory, with directory
  indexes.
* `Rack::MediaType` for parsing content-type headers.
* `Rack::Mime` for determining content-type based on file extension.
* `Rack::RewindableInput` for making any IO object rewindable, using a temporary
  file buffer.
* `Rack::URLMap` to route to multiple applications inside the same process.

## Configuration

Rack exposes several configuration parameters to control various features of the
implementation.

### `param_depth_limit`

```
Rack::Utils.param_depth_limit = 32 # default
```

The maximum amount of nesting allowed in parameters. For example, if set to 3,
this query string would be allowed:

```
?a[b][c]=d

```

but this query string would not be allowed:

```
?a[b][c][d]=e

```

Limiting the depth prevents a possible stack overflow when parsing parameters.

### `multipart_file_limit`

```
Rack::Utils.multipart_file_limit = 128 # default
```

The maximum number of parts with a filename a request can contain. Accepting
too many parts can lead to the server running out of file handles.

The default is 128, which means that a single request can't upload more than 128
files at once. Set to 0 for no limit.

Can also be set via the `RACK_MULTIPART_FILE_LIMIT` environment variable.

(This is also aliased as `multipart_part_limit` and `RACK_MULTIPART_PART_LIMIT` for compatibility)

### `multipart_total_part_limit`

The maximum total number of parts a request can contain of any type, including
both file and non-file form fields.

The default is 4096, which means that a single request can't contain more than
4096 parts.

Set to 0 for no limit.

Can also be set via the `RACK_MULTIPART_TOTAL_PART_LIMIT` environment variable.

## Topic

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.2.1, which fixes several security
issues, multiple bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager acts as a proxy for handling
subscription information and software updates on client machines.

The latest packages for Subscription Asset Manager include a number of security
fixes:

When a Subscription Asset Manager instance is created, its configuration
script automatically creates an RPM of the internal subscription service
CA certificate. However, this RPM incorrectly created the CA certificate
with file permissions of 0666. This allowed other users on a client system
to modify the CA certificate used to trust the remote subscription server.
All administrators are advised to update and deploy the subscription
service certificate on all systems which use Subscription Asset Manager
as their subscription service. This procedure is described in:
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Asset_Manager/1.2/html/Installation_Guide/sect-Installation_Guide-Administration-Upgrading_Subscription_Asset_Manager.html> (CVE-2012-6116)

Manifest signature checking was not implemented for early versions of
Subscription Asset Manager. This meant that a malicious user could edit
a manifest file, insert arbitrary data, and successfully upload the edited
manifest file into the Subscription Asset Manager server. (CVE-2012-6119)

Ruby's documentation generator had a flaw in the way it generated HTML
documentation. When a Ruby application exposed its documentation
on a network (such as a web page), an attacker could use a specially-
crafted URL to open an arbitrary web script or to execute HTML code
within the application's user session. (CVE-2013-0256)

A timing attack flaw was found in the way rubygem-rack and
ruby193-rubygem-rack processed HMAC digests in cookies. This flaw could aid
an attacker using forged digital signatures to bypass authentication
checks. (CVE-2013-0263)

A flaw in rubygem-json allowed remote attacks by creating different types
of malicious objects. For example, it could initiate a denial of service
(DoS) attack through resource consumption by using a JSON document to
create arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected. It
could also be exploited to create internal objects which could allow a SQL
injection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)

A flaw in ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails allowed remote attackers to
circumvent attribute protections and to insert their own crafted requests
to change protected attribute values. (CVE-2013-0276)

HTML markup was not properly escaped when filling in the username field in
the Notifications form of the Subscription Asset Manager UI. This meant
that HTML code used in the value was then applied in the UI page when the
entry was viewed. This could have allowed malicious HTML code to be
entered. The field value is now validated and any HTML tags are escaped.
(CVE-2013-1823)

These updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements:

* Previously, no SELinux policy for the subscription service was included

with the Subscription Asset Manager packages. The candlepin-selinux package
is now included with SELinux policies for the subscription server.
(BZ#906901)

* When attempting to use the subscription service's CA certificate to

validate a manifest during import, the comparison failed. The upstream
subscription service which generated the manifest is a different service
than the local subscription service; thus, they have different CA
certificates. This caused importing a manifest to fail with the error
'archive failed signature'. This has been fixed so that the proper
certificate is used for verification. (BZ#918778)

All users of Subscription Asset Manager are recommended to update to the
latest packages.
