  "cve": "CVE-2013-0263",
  "description": "Rack::Session::Cookie in Rack 1.5.x before 1.5.2, 1.4.x before 1.4.5, 1.3.x before 1.3.10, 1.2.x before 1.2.8, and 1.1.x before 1.1.6 allows remote attackers to guess the session cookie, gain privileges, and execute arbitrary code via a timing attack involving an HMAC comparison function that does not run in constant time.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The HMAC comparison in `Rack::Session::Cookie` was vulnerable to a timing attack because it used a variable-time comparison algorithm. The comparison would exit early when characters did not match, creating timing differences that could be measured by an attacker.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack",
       "Non-constant time HMAC comparison"
     ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers could guess session cookies, potentially leading to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability could be exploited by sending specially crafted requests and measuring the timing differences in the response. This was exploitable over a network (including a LAN).",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send requests to the server and measure response times."
