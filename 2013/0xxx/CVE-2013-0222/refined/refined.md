{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `uniq` command in coreutils used the `alloca()` function without proper restrictions on input string length, leading to a stack overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of stack allocation size based on user-controlled input."
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted input with extremely long strings can cause the `uniq` command to crash due to a segmentation fault.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can supply a crafted input stream containing very long strings to the `uniq` command.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the `uniq` command with the crafted input, which can be achieved by either local or remote means if the command is exposed through some service or script."
