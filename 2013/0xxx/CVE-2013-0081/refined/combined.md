## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint Server Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2834052)

Published: September 10, 2013 | Updated: November 06, 2013

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and nine privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Server software. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution in the context of the W3WP service account if an attacker sends specially crafted content to the affected server.

This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Services 2.0, Microsoft SharePoint Services 3.0, and Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010. This security update is also rated Critical for affected Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps on supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010. In addition, this security update is rated Important for Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013, Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013, and Excel Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by enabling machine authentication check (MAC) according to best practices, correcting how SharePoint Server sanitizes requests, correcting how SharePoint Server verifies and handles undefined workflows, and correcting how Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps parse specially crafted files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website, and convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources**
