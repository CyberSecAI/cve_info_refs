Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the "Bookmarkable Pages" functionality of the Oracle Applications Framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The specific weakness is not detailed beyond "Bookmarkable Pages". It can be inferred that the vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as it is common in cases where user-controlled input is reflected without proper encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows for partial modification of data. This suggests the vulnerability could be used to alter displayed content, redirect users to malicious sites, or potentially steal cookies/session information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based via HTTP. An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL that, when accessed, injects malicious code through the vulnerable "Bookmarkable Pages" functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and have a user with access to the affected Oracle E-Business Suite application click on it.
- The attacker needs some form of authentication, but a low level single login privilege would be enough. This is not a "remotely exploitable without authentication" flaw.

**Additional Notes**
- The Oracle document notes that the CVSS score is 2.1, which is very low, due to the attacker needing authentication, but is network-based
- This vulnerability is specific to Oracle E-Business Suite versions 11.5.10.2, 12.0.6, and 12.1.3.
