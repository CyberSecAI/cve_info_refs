Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-0030

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory when processing Vector Markup Language (VML). Specially crafted VML data can corrupt memory during buffer allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Improper handling of VML data leads to memory corruption. This is the core weakness exploited by the vulnerability.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The memory corruption can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the logged-in user.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, an attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** Attackers can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability when viewed with Internet Explorer.
- **Embedded ActiveX Controls:** The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding a malicious ActiveX control marked as "safe for initialization" within an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the Internet Explorer rendering engine.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content or advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through a network.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious document. They have no way to force the user to interact with their malicious content.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to create specially crafted VML data that triggers the memory corruption vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security update was released.
- Microsoft was not aware of active exploitation for remote code execution at the time of the bulletinâ€™s release but was aware of limited targeted attacks using the vulnerability for information disclosure.
- The exploitability index was rated as "0 - Exploitation detected", meaning exploitation was occurring at the time of the security update release.
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Internet Explorer versions (6, 7, 8, 9 and 10) across multiple Windows operating systems, including client and server editions.
- Mitigation includes reading emails in plain text to avoid processing potentially malicious HTML/VML content.
- Server Core installations are not affected.
