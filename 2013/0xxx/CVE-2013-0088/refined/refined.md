Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-0088:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a "use-after-free" condition in Internet Explorer. This occurs when the browser attempts to access an object in memory that has already been deleted or freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is the use of a pointer to a memory location that has been deallocated, leading to potential corruption. Specifically related to the `saveHistory` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user. This means the attacker gains the same level of access as the logged-in user.
- **System Compromise:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Potential actions:** An attacker can then install malware, view, modify, or delete data, and create new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host specially crafted websites designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can leverage compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content to inject malicious code.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers rely on tricking users into visiting these malicious websites, often through links in emails or instant messages, or opening malicious email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the victim's machine.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to take an action like clicking on a link or opening a file.
- **Crafted Web Content:** Ability to create a malicious HTML page that will trigger the use-after-free vulnerability when rendered by a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is associated with the `saveHistory` function in Internet Explorer.
- The vulnerability was privately reported.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 on various versions of Windows.
- The severity is rated as "Critical" for client operating systems and "Moderate" for server operating systems.
