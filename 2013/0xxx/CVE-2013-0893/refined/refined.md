Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-0893:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a **race condition** in the media handling component of Google Chrome.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The core weakness is a race condition, where multiple threads or processes access and modify shared resources (media data or related structures) concurrently without proper synchronization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is not detailed, but a race condition in media handling can lead to various issues, including:
    *   **Memory corruption**: If the race condition causes inconsistent state or incorrect memory access.
    *   **Unexpected behavior**:  The application may behave in unpredictable ways due to the unsynchronized access.
    *   **Denial of Service**: A crash or other instability resulting from the vulnerability.
    *   **Potential security vulnerabilities:** If the memory corruption is exploitable, it could lead to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through media processing within the Google Chrome browser.
*   An attacker can likely trigger the race condition by manipulating how media content is loaded and played.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need to be able to serve or inject specifically crafted media content to trigger the race condition in the victim's browser.
*   No specific user interaction beyond visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file might be required.

**Additional Notes**
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in Chromium version 27.0.1425.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
*   The vulnerability was found by Andrew Scherkus of the Chromium development community.
