How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* Threat identified, and promptly neutralized

21 Jan 2013
### Threat identified, and promptly neutralized

On **Friday, Jan.18**, a third-party researcher (Fernando Muñoz) informed Secunia Research SVCRP of a possible issue with the PDF-XChange Viewer: Build 2.5.207 whereby an embedded JPEG stream within a PDF file could be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

Questionable as the threat was to our customers, it was treated with extreme importance. Within 24 hours Tracker Software issued a new release with protection against this potential, if unlikely, risk.

All Tracker Software clients are urged to update to our latest, free PDF-XChange Viewer: Build 2.5.208 as soon as possible.

The specific technical nature of the threat was:  Hypothetical/potential exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but requires tricking a user into opening a malicious PDF document where a memory override can occur on handling the corrupted Define Huffman Table header of a JPEG image file stream.

Acknowledging software defects and security holes is inevitable and Tracker Software treats mission-critical defects and security issues very seriously.

Prompt responses to software defects and security holes have always been — and will continue to be — a top priority of Tracker Software’s product service.

Our known security issue list — a total of four in more than 15 years of product releases and approximately 150 million client installations — is much shorter than that of our competitors’ due to the robust design of our products.

Tracker has published all the historic security issues on its website and keeps tracking potential security issues on daily basis.

We will continue to ensure our clients are protected with quality products and prompt action to resolve any issues found.
