Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0731:

**Content Overview:**

The provided content includes information from Flexera's website about their vulnerability research and from WordPress.org regarding a plugin called "wp-mailup". The WordPress.org content, particularly the changeset, directly relates to the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-0731.

**Analysis of CVE-2013-0731 (based on provided content):**

* **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability in the wp-mailup plugin stemmed from an insecure method of checking if a user was logged in. The plugin was relying on the presence of a specific cookie (`wordpress_logged_in`) to determine authentication status. This method was flawed because the cookie's presence alone doesn't guarantee a valid, authenticated user session.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    * **Insecure Authentication Check:** The primary vulnerability was the flawed logic for checking user login status by merely verifying the existence of a specific cookie. This is easily spoofable.
    * **Lack of Proper Session Validation:** The plugin did not perform proper server-side session validation to confirm the user's authentication.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to plugin settings and configurations by forging the `wordpress_logged_in` cookie.
    * **Data Manipulation:** If successful, an attacker could potentially manipulate data and settings managed by the plugin.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Cookie Spoofing:** The attack vector would involve an attacker creating a forged `wordpress_logged_in` cookie and sending it with a request to the plugin's AJAX handling script.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker would need the ability to send HTTP requests with custom headers, including setting cookies.
    * **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Plugin:**  They would need knowledge of the vulnerable wp-mailup plugin, specifically its AJAX handling endpoints and how it checks for login status.
    * **No Prior Authentication Required:** The attacker did not need to be a logged-in user to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The changeset `682420` in the provided WordPress.org content shows the fix for this vulnerability. It reveals that the vulnerable code was in `ajax.functions.php`. The original code checked for the `wordpress_logged_in` cookie. The patch replaced this with WordPress's built-in function `is_user_logged_in()`, which provides a secure way to check if a user is properly authenticated. Additionally, there are code changes for stripping slashes from the input and adding logic to return 'ACCESS DENIED' if the user is not logged in.

**Additional Notes:**
   *  The provided content gives more details than a typical CVE description by showing the exact code changes that fixed the vulnerability.
   * The secunia content does not have information related to the CVE, it's a page describing their vulnerability research services.
   * The WordPress plugin has been closed as of August 5, 2021.

**Summary:**
The wp-mailup plugin had a security flaw that allowed unauthenticated users to access sensitive functionalities, by using an insecure method of checking for logged-in status. The plugin was patched to use `is_user_logged_in()` which is a secure method of checking login status.
