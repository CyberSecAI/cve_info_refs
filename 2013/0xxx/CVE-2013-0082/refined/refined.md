Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Office software parses specially crafted WordPerfect document (.wpd) files. Specifically, there's a memory corruption issue when handling objects within these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: Incorrect parsing of .wpd files leads to memory corruption.
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation could allow arbitrary code execution.
- Stack Buffer Overflow (CVE-2013-1324), and Heap Overflow (CVE-2013-1325) were also present in the way Microsoft Office parsed the same .wpd files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Complete system control: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new user accounts.
- Users with fewer privileges are less affected but still vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email: Attackers can send specially crafted .wpd files as email attachments and trick users into opening them with vulnerable versions of Microsoft Office.
- Web-based attacks: Attackers can host malicious .wpd files on websites, enticing users to download and open them. Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could also be leveraged to host these files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create specially crafted .wpd files.
- Ability to deliver the crafted file to the victim either by email or via website/compromised websites.
- Social engineering is required to convince users to open the malicious .wpd file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is not automatically exploitable via email. Users need to open the attachment.
- Microsoft's Exploitability Index indicates this vulnerability as "Exploitation more likely".
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013.
- The vulnerability was privately reported to Microsoft, with no evidence of public exploitation before the security update was released.
- A workaround is suggested involving restricting access to the `wpft632.cnv` file converter, but it impacts the ability to use the WordPerfect file conversion functionality.
