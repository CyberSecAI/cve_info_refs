{
  "CVE-2013-0241": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way the host's qemu-kvm qxl driver and the guest's X.Org qxl driver interacted when a SPICE connection terminated. An attacker that could connect to a guest using SPICE and the QXL graphics driver could cause the guest to hang or crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "The QXL graphics driver incorrectly handled terminated connections.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of terminated SPICE connections by the QXL graphics driver, leading to a race condition."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could cause the guest to hang or crash, resulting in a denial of service. If the sysctl kernel.softlockup_panic variable is set to \"1\" in the guest, it could potentially crash the guest.",
    "Attack vector": "An attacker needs to initiate a SPICE connection to a guest using the QXL graphics driver.",
    "Required capabilities": "Attacker must have the ability to establish a SPICE connection to a guest system using the vulnerable QXL graphics driver."
  }
