# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Moderate: xorg-x11-drv-qxl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0218)

## Topic

An updated xorg-x11-drv-qxl package that fixes one security issue is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The xorg-x11-drv-qxl package provides an X11 video driver for the QEMU QXL
video accelerator. This driver makes it possible to use Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6 as a guest operating system under the KVM kernel module and the
QEMU multi-platform emulator, using the SPICE protocol.

A flaw was found in the way the host's qemu-kvm qxl driver and the guest's
X.Org qxl driver interacted when a SPICE connection terminated. A user able
to initiate a SPICE connection to a guest could use this flaw to make the
guest temporarily unavailable or, potentially (if the sysctl
kernel.softlockup\_panic variable was set to "1" in the guest), crash the
guest. (CVE-2013-0241)

All users of xorg-x11-drv-qxl are advised to upgrade to this updated
package, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue. All
running X.Org server instances using the qxl driver must be restarted for
this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

## Synopsis

Moderate: xorg-x11-drv-qxl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0218)

## Topic

An updated xorg-x11-drv-qxl package that fixes one security issue is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The xorg-x11-drv-qxl package provides an X11 video driver for the QEMU QXL
video accelerator. This driver makes it possible to use Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6 as a guest operating system under the KVM kernel module and the
QEMU multi-platform emulator, using the SPICE protocol.

A flaw was found in the way the host's qemu-kvm qxl driver and the guest's
X.Org qxl driver interacted when a SPICE connection terminated. A user able
to initiate a SPICE connection to a guest could use this flaw to make the
guest temporarily unavailable or, potentially (if the sysctl
kernel.softlockup\_panic variable was set to "1" in the guest), crash the
guest. (CVE-2013-0241)

All users of xorg-x11-drv-qxl are advised to upgrade to this updated
package, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue. All
running X.Org server instances using the qxl driver must be restarted for
this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=906032#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-01-30 16:31:25 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way spice connection breakups were handled in the qemu-kvm qxl driver. Some of the qxl port i/o commands were waiting for the spice server to complete the actions, while the corresponding thread holds qemu_mutex mutex, potentially blocking other threads in the guest's qemu-kvm process. An user able to initiate spice connection to the guest could use this flaw to make guest temporarily unavailable or, in case kernel.softlockup_panic in the guest was set, crash the guest.  Upstream fixes: xf86-video-qxl commit <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-video-qxl/commit/?id=30b4b72cdbdf9f0e92a8d1c4e01779f60f15a741>  which relies on qemu-kvm functionality introduced by commit <http://git.kernel.org/?p=virt/kvm/qemu-kvm.git;a=commit;h=5ff4e36c>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=906032#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-31 19:32:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0218 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0218.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=906032#c2)  Alon Levy    2013-04-18 06:44:02 UTC  ``` The fix isn't really a fix for all situations, since old drivers could be run in the guest and we don't prevent that from happening.  On the other hand in second reading I don't think I agree with this being a CVE at all. Sure, the viewer app, which is remote, can cause the guest to be unresponsive, even to crash. But:   1. This is no different then running a faulty guest kernel, something a remote user can do already.  2. The viewer is part of the guest, i.e. it is treated as having permissions to do anything in the guest, if it should be verified then we use a password for that. This point overlaps point 1.  3. qemu doesn't crash in the process, the host isn't affected.  Alon   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=906032#c3)  Petr Matousek    2013-04-24 08:35:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=906032#c2)) > The fix isn't really a fix for all situations, since old drivers could be > run in the guest and we don't prevent that from happening.  Right, but we document that the fix relies on qemu-kvm functionality in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=906032#c0).  > On the other hand in second reading I don't think I agree with this being a > CVE at all. Sure, the viewer app, which is remote, can cause the guest to be > unresponsive, even to crash. But: > ...  Can the user have access to spice console and not be a guest administrator?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=906032#c4)  Alon Levy    2013-04-24 08:54:39 UTC  ``` I see your point, it can be considered an elevation from a general spice console user to a guest administrator.(In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=906032#c3)) > (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=906032#c2)) > > The fix isn't really a fix for all situations, since old drivers could be > > run in the guest and we don't prevent that from happening. >  > Right, but we document that the fix relies on qemu-kvm functionality in > [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=906032#c0). >  > > On the other hand in second reading I don't think I agree with this being a > > CVE at all.

I see your point, it can be considered an elevation from a general spice console user to a guest administrator. Yes, what you describe is possible, I'm used to the situation where they are the same but probably it isn't common in an office deployment where there is a separate administrator.   ``` |  |

On the other hand in second reading I don't think I agree with this being a CVE at all. Sure, the viewer app, which is remote, can cause the guest to be unresponsive, even to crash. But:   1. This is no different then running a faulty guest kernel, something a remote user can do already.  2. The viewer is part of the guest, i.e. it is treated as having permissions to do anything in the guest, if it should be verified then we use a password for that. This point overlaps point 1.  3. qemu doesn't crash in the process, the host isn't affected.

I see your point, it can be considered an elevation from a general spice console user to a guest administrator. Yes, what you describe is possible, I'm used to the situation where they are the same but probably it isn't common in an office deployment where there is a separate administrator.   ``` |  |

Subject: CVE request -- qxl: synchronous io guest DoS

A flaw was found in the way spice connection breakups were handled in
the qemu-kvm qxl driver. Some of the qxl port i/o commands were waiting
for the spice server to complete the actions, while the corresponding
thread holds qemu_mutex mutex, potentially blocking other threads in the
guest's qemu-kvm process. An user able to initiate spice connection to
the guest could use this flaw to make guest temporarily unavailable or,
in case kernel.softlockup_panic in the guest was set, crash the guest.

Upstream fixes:

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-video-qxl/commit/?id=30b4b72cdbdf9f0e92a8d1c4e01779f60f15a741>

which relies on qemu-kvm functionality introduced by commit
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=virt/kvm/qemu-kvm.git;a=commit;h=5ff4e36c>

| **Date:** | February 6th, 2013 |
| --- | --- |
| **Affected releases:** | 2 |
| **Media:** | Core |

**Description:**

Updated x11-driver-video-qxl package fixes security vulnerability:

A flaw was found in the way the host's qemu-kvm qxl driver and the guest's

X.Org qxl driver interacted when a SPICE connection terminated. A user able

to initiate a SPICE connection to a guest could use this flaw to make the

guest temporarily unavailable or, potentially (if the sysctl

kernel.softlockup\_panic variable was set to "1" in the guest), crash the

guest (CVE-2013-0241).

**Updated Packages:**

i586:

x11-driver-video-qxl-0.0.16-4.1.mga2.i586.rpm

x11-driver-video-qxl-debug-0.0.16-4.1.mga2.i586.rpm

x86\_64:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8938#c0)  David Walser    2013-02-01 20:15:06 CET  ``` RedHat has issued an advisory on January 31: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0218.html>  The qemu-kvm code that the fix is dependent on (according to the RedHat bug), is present in our qemu in both Mageia 2 and Cauldron.  Mageia 2 is also affected. ```  David Walser    2013-02-01 20:15:16 CET   CC: (none) => thierry.vignaudWhiteboard: (none) => MGA2TOO  David Walser    2013-02-01 20:15:33 CET   Summary: x11-driver-video-qxl => x11-driver-video-qxl new security issue CVE-2013-0241  David Walser    2013-02-01 20:17:37 CET   URL: (none) => http://lwn.net/Vulnerabilities/535718/  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=8938#c1)  David Walser    2013-02-01 23:54:53 CET  ``` This is already fixed upstream in the version we have in Cauldron.  Patched package uploaded for Mageia 2.  Advisory: ========================  Updated x11-driver-video-qxl package fixes security vulnerability:  A flaw was found in the way the host's qemu-kvm qxl driver and the guest's X.Org qxl driver interacted when a SPICE connection terminated. A user able to initiate a SPICE connection to a guest could use this flaw to make the guest temporarily unavailable or, potentially (if the sysctl kernel.softlockup_panic variable was set to "1" in the guest), crash the guest (CVE-2013-0241).

Currently creating a 32 bit Mageia 2 qemu installation, with this option, to test it. ```  ---   CC: (none) => davidwhodgins  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=8938#c3)  Dave Hodgins    2013-02-03 02:02:24 CET  ``` Painfully slow.  It's clear that no one is using this, or there would be a lot of bug reports.  Besides being slow, I noticed the following problems.  Black horizontal lines, roughly every 10 pixels from top to bottom of the screen.  Mouse cursor is either not visible, or when it is, doesn't reflect where the mouse cursor actually is, and every time the mouse cursor touches the edge of the screen, the position of the actual mouse cursor relative to where it's displayed changes, so the only way to figure out where it is, is to move it around until something gets highlighted, or right click on the desktop, and see where the context menu opens.  Also had many crashes of xorg.  These problems were found both before and after installing the update.  The script I used for installing (after creating the disk image) was #!/bin/bash Dir="/qemu" Size="16G" Arch="32" Iso="/s3/m3/mageia3-beta2/Mageia-3-beta2-LiveDVD-KDE4-i586-DVD/Mageia-3-beta2-LiveDVD-KDE4-i586-DVD.iso" Iso="/home/dave/software/i2/boot-nonfree.iso" cd "$Dir" qemu-img create mageia"$Arch".qcow "$Size" qemu-system-i386 -cdrom "$Iso" -hda mageia"$Arch".qcow2 -boot d -net nic -net user,net=192.168.10.0/16,host=192.168.10.3 -m 2047 -vga qxl  This was with the kvm module loaded.  Testing complete on Mageia 2 i586. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=8938#c4)  Dave Hodgins    2013-02-03 03:22:02 CET  ``` Testing x86-64 now. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=8938#c5)  Dave Hodgins    2013-02-03 09:38:08 CET  ``` I made the mistake of thinking qemu-system-x86_64 would be faster than the i586 version, on a x86_64 host.  After 6 hours getting a full kde install, that has spent 20 minutes, with the desktop showing, but no icons yet available on the panel, I'm going to post a message to the developers mailing list asking for qemu to be dropped from Mageia 3, as a useless package.  I'm giving up trying to test this package.  As it's a security update, I'm going to go ahead and validate it, even though it's clear no-one could be using it.  I have confirmed the updated package installs cleanly, on a 64 bit system.  Could someone from the sysadmin team push the srpm x11-driver-video-qxl-0.0.16-4.1.mga2.src.rpm from Mageia 2 Core Updates Testing to Core Updates.  Advisory: Updated x11-driver-video-qxl package fixes security vulnerability:  A flaw was found in the way the host's qemu-kvm qxl driver and the guest's X.Org qxl driver interacted when a SPICE connection terminated.

I don't think we can cover all the prerequisites (hardware virtualisation support in your CPU, hardware virtualisation enabled in your BIOS) of a modern hypervisor in a bug report.  But, the lack of bug reports on a platform that is used by all the major linux distros as enterprise virtualisation may rather point to how well KVM works.  Please continue shipping updates, as many people are using these packages. ```  ---   CC: (none) => bgmilne  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=8938#c10)  David Walser    2013-02-12 20:38:31 CET  ``` Well this particular package is completely broken on Cauldron, so someone needs to take care of it.  Christiaan said he tried and wasn't able to.  I did notice that ROSA has a newer version of it, so maybe syncing with them would fix it. ```  ---   CC: (none) => cjw |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
