<pre><pre>This is an update for the 0.9 development branch of nss-pam-ldapd that
includes the collected smaller improvements and bugfixes over the last
two years. This release should be considered stable.
The pynslcd implementation still is not considered as stable as nslcd.
A summary of the changes since 0.9.11:
\* allow explicitly configuring an empty search base (for LDAP servers
that support that)
\* support LDAP attributes with minus characters in attribute mapping
expressions
\* add tls\_reqsan, tls\_crlfile and tls\_crlcheck options (thanks
Sebastien Blavier)
\* support generating ldaps:// URIs from DNS SRV records for port 389 by
using DNSLDAPS in the uri option
\* prefer the first URI listed in nslcd.conf after reconnecting after
idle\_timelimit
\* fix handling of pam\_authc\_ppolicy no
\* fix debug logging of ldap timeout values
\* documentation improvements (thanks Filip Dvorak and Benedict
Reuschling)
\* add pam\_authc\_ppolicy support to pynslcd
\* fix Python 3 compatibility in chsh.ldap
\* fix for running pynslcd without the uid option
\* partial support for running tests with slapd 2.5 (thanks Ryan Tandy)
\* miscellaneous test suite improvements
\* test suite fixes for Solaris
This will be the last release that will be tested on Solaris as it is
increasingly difficult to do so. Existing support for building on
Solaris will be retained for now.

nss-pam-ldapd ending support on the 0.7 series

<pre><pre>
Because the latest 0.8 release is now well over 5 years stable and the
0.9 series is stable for about 3 years, from this point forward the 0.7
series of nss-pam-ldapd will no longer be supported.
The 0.8 series will remain supported for some time with security fixes
and major bug fixes as needed. The 0.9 series will also receive other
bug fixes and enhancements.
Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest 0.9 release because
stability is at least comparable to 0.8 and a lot more useful features
were added such as tunable logging, nested groups, password policy
support, invalidating caches and more powerful attribute mapping
expressions.

\* any buffers that may have held passwords are cleared before
the memory is released
\* increase buffer size for passwords to support extremely long
passwords (thanks ushi)
\* increase buffer size for DN to support very long names or
names with non-ASCII characters
\* log an error in almost all places where a defined buffer is
not large enough to hold the provided data instead of just
(sometimes silently) failing
\* logging improvements (start-up problems, login failures)
\* small improvement for Solaris

This is an update for the 0.9 development branch of nss-pam-ldapd that
includes a number of improvements. This branch will see more development
and features added, although it does seem to stabilise somewhat.
However, this isn't the most stable version and should be used with
care. The 0.8 branch will remain to be supported with bug and security
fixes for some time.
A summary of the changes since 0.9.2:
\* make the dn2uid cache lifetime configurable with the cache
configuration option
\* have the nslcd process only exit after the service is
completely available to avoid race conditions in the init
script
\* the nslcd daemon now properly daemonises (double fork)
\* support mapping the member attribute to an empty string to
disable the functionality to do extra lookups for member DN
to member uid translations
\* implement deref control handling to request the LDAP server
to dereference group member attribute values to uid values
\* support getting built-in groups from Active Directory (thanks
Davy Defaud)
\* fix for pwdLastSet attribute value handling (thanks Joshua
Shire)
\* fix a possible crash in the NSS module when retrieving large
networks entries (thanks Lukas Slebodnik)
\* correct NSS h\_errnop return value to indicate buffer too
small (thanks Nalin Dahyabhai)
\* fix a bug with shadow values on 64-bit architectures (only
present in 0.9 series)
\* automatically detect DragonFly as using the FreeBSD NSS
interface (thanks Francois Tigeot)
\* add a build-time test to see if krb5 is thread-safe
\* various minor bug fixes

This is an update for the 0.7 series that includes fixes for a few
issues. The changes should be minimal and have mostly been available in
the 0.8 branch for some time.
From this point on, the 0.7 series will only get updates for serious
(security) issues. Users are encouraged to upgrade the the more
up-to-date 0.8 or 0.9 series.
A summary of the changes since 0.7.18:
\* use the more portable EBADF instead of EBADFD (thanks Steven
Chamberlain)
\* fix buffer overflow on interrupted read that is hard to
trigger (thanks John Sullivan)
\* extra sanity check to ensure not too many file descriptors
are open

production deployments.

\* increase password value buffer size (by Bersl)
\* avoid more broken pipe errors by using a low timeout when
aborting reading requested information from nslcd (thanks
John Sullivan)
\* only log broken pipe errors in debugging mode
\* fix buffer overflow on interrupted read that is hard to
trigger (thanks John Sullivan)
\* use clock\_gettime() with CLOCK\_MONOTONIC for timeout
calculations to avoid clock adjustments errors (thanks John
Sullivan)
\* extend test suite to test for CLOCK\_MONOTONIC and timed IO
timeout calculations
\* increase the maximum number of base statements per map to 31
\* use larger nslcd send buffers to reduce the number of write
operations in nslcd and consequently the number of reads in
the NSS and PAM modules (thanks John Sullivan)
\* also run invalidators after first successful search
\* various clean-ups, portability improvements and fixes for
compiler warnings
\* import configure checks of Python modules
\* provide a script for setting up slapd in a test environment,
automatically loaded with the required test data
\* add script for evaluating test environment availability
\* portability improvements in the test scripts and test
environment

This is an update for the 0.9 development branch of nss-pam-ldapd that
includes a number of new features. This branch will see more development
and features added.
As such, this isn't the most stable version and should be used with
caution. The 0.7 and 0.8 branches will remain to be supported with bug
and security fixes for some time.
A summary of the changes since 0.9.0:
\* rename the nscd\_invalidate option to reconnect\_invalidate and allow
flushing the nfsidmap cache with the new option
\* implement an -n switch to not daemonise (by Caleb Callaway)
\* nslcd will now return partial shadow information to non-root users to
avoid authorisation problems with setgid shadow authentication helpers
with some PAM stacks
\* nslcd will now retry failing LDAP connections after receiving SIGUSR1
(SIGUSR1 could be sent after re-establishing a network connection)
\* fix the way manual pages are installed in some situations
\* the code for the nslcd utilities (getent.ldap and chsh.ldap) is now
installed in {prefix}/share/nslcd-utils
\* improve error and help output of the getent.ldap command
\* documentation updates
\* a number of tests were added and existing tests were extended
\* fix for a potential, small memory leak in PAM module regarding
temporary saving of old password
\* a large number of bug fixes and improvements in pynslcd
\* hide passwords from the pynslcd debug output
\* support start\_tls, pam\_password\_prohibit\_message,
nss\_initgroups\_ignoreusers and nss\_min\_uid in pynslcd
\* fix rootpwmodpw handling in pynslcd
\* complete a basic PAM implementation in pynslcd (some things such as
shadow attribute checking remain to be implemented)
\* clean up the caching functionality in pynslcd (functionality is still
disabled)

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/">http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/</a>
The pynslcd implementation is becoming more and more featureful and
robust. It should be a reasonable replacement for nslcd in some
environments. The biggest missing features are support for multiple LDAP
servers with fail-over and support for authenticated LDAP connections
for normal operations.
However, pynslcd is still not as well tested as nslcd.
Ideas, comments and patches for functionality are more than welcome.

problems with a newer nslcd
\* retry updating the lastChange attribute with the normal nslcd LDAP
connection if the update with the user's connection failed
\* avoid processing passwd\_byuid requests for uids below nss\_min\_uid
\* fix a few minor or very unlikely to occur memory leaks

<pre><pre>I'm pleased to announce release 0.9.0 of nss-pam-ldapd. The 0.9 branch
is the new development branch of nss-pam-ldapd in which a number of new
features are and will be introduced.
Amongst the most prominent new features are support for nested groups,
utilities for updating user information and handling of password policy
controls.
As such, this isn't the most stable version and should be used with
caution for now. Users are encouraged to test this release and provide
feedback.
The 0.7 and 0.8 branches will remain to be supported with bug and
security fixes for some time. Some of the features that have received
sufficient testing in the 0.9 series may be backported into the 0.8
series.
A summary of the changes since 0.8.13 (some more details below):
\* backwards incompatible change to the communications protocol between
nslcd and NSS and PAM modules to use network byte order to be able to
work on mixed endian multiarch systems and do some restructuring
\* netgroup lookups now makes a distinction between empty netgroups and
non-existing netgroups
\* the PAM protocol is now more consistent (cleaner support for password
modification by root, have all request parameters in the same order
and limit the information returned from the call)
\* request and handle password policy controls on LDAP authentication
\* implement support for nested groups which can be enabled with the
nss\_nested\_groups option (thanks Steve Hill)
\* add a log option to configure log level and logging to plain files
\* add an nscd\_invalidate option to invalidate the nscd cache after
recovering from LDAP connection problems (to clear any negative cache
entries)
\* allow trimming expressions with ${foo#bar} syntax in attribute mapping
expressions (thanks Thorsten Glaser)
\* pynslcd supports trimming expressions with full shell glob matching
\* support password modification in pynslcd
\* support children search scope for systems that have it
\* add a getent.ldap utility to perform nslcd queries bypassing the libc
NSS stack
\* implement functionality for changing user information and provide a
chsh.ldap utility to allow users to change their login shell
\* remove deprecated use\_sasl, reconnect\_tries, reconnect\_maxsleeptime
and tls\_checkpeer options which have been replaced long ago
\* allow names with one character in default validnames option and allow
parentheses (taken from Fedora packages)
\* fall back to updating the lastChange attribute with the normal LDAP
connection
\* dump full nslcd configuration at debug level on start-up
\* export an \_nss\_ldap\_version symbol in the NSS module to make finding
version mismatches easier (the NSS module version is logged from
nslcd)
\* documentation improvements
\* update the coding style for the C source code to follow a more modern
and commonly used coding convention
\* some parts of the code were refactored or rewritten to take into
account the changes within the software (e.g. configuration file
handling, reduction in the number of system calls for normal
communication)
\* numerous smaller fixes
\* portability and robustness improvements to the tests
\* implement lookup\_netgroup and lookup\_shadow test commands for systems
that cannot use getent to query these
\* guess the value for --with-pam-seclib-dir configure option if it is
not specified
\* temporary disable the caching functionality of pynslcd
\* usability improvements in the pynslcd implementation
\* various fixes for Solaris
This version introduces a backwards incompatible protocol change which
means it is no longer possible to use the NSS or PAM module of a
previous release and nslcd from a newer release (or vice versa). Since
these modules are generally loaded once per process, old versions of
these modules could be present in longer running processes when
upgrading.
The protocol has basically been stable since the beginning of the
project and a few inconveniences have piled up. Until the 0.9 series is
stable the protocol may change again in backwards incompatible ways.
This release introduces a switch to a more commonly used C coding style.
Also code was reviewed and refactored to be easier to maintain. This may
make it difficult to port patches. For help with porting or integration
into nss-pam-ldapd, send patches to the nss-pam-ldapd-users mailing
list.
As previously announced, Git is now used for revision control and the
Subversion repository will only be used to maintain older releases.
This release includes contributions from many people. I would like to
thank everybody that contributed bug reports, patches and their time to
this release.

Some more ideas and features that may be implemented in the 0.9 series
are:
\* see if we can find a proper solution for systems that organise users
differently (e.g. FreeBSD doesn't have shadow information
\* rework the pynslcd caching functionality and get pynslcd
production-ready
\* add more utilities for managing users, groups and other objects in
LDAP (the rootpwmoddn option will probably be renamed to rootmoddn)
\* support a wider range of authentication mechanisms for the protocol
between the NSS module and nslcd (especially useful for the utility
functions)
Ideas, comments and patches for functionality are more than welcome.
Please drop a note on the nss-pam-ldapd-users mailing list with any
ideas or patches you may have.

Garth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the
use of FD\_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd can lead to a buffer overflow. An
attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to cause a
process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or potentially
execute arbitrary code.
This problem affects all releases before 0.7.18 and 0.8.11.
This problem has been assigned CVE-2013-0288.
More details are available at:
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/CVE-2013-0288">http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/CVE-2013-0288</a>
Users are advised to apply the appropriate patch or upgrade to 0.8.11 or
0.7.18.

In order to use some of the advantages of a distributed VCS, the
nss-pam-ldapd project is currently slowly moving the development from
Subversion to Git. A migrated Git repository can be cloned with:
git clone <a rel="nofollow" href="http://arthurdejong.org/git/nss-pam-ldapd">http://arthurdejong.org/git/nss-pam-ldapd</a>
At this time, commits are still published primarily in the Subversion
repository and the Git repository is automatically updated. The
development branch will probably be moved to Git soon. At that point,
the development branch will no longer be updated in Subversion.
Work on the 0.7 and 0.8 maintenance branches and the Debian packaging
are expected to remain in Subversion.
The Subversion repository was automatically converted with some manual
clean-ups to properly set the Git tags. Commits originating from
Subversion will retain the git-svn-id information to make it easier to
find references to revision numbers in commit messages.
Some work remains to be done on setting up a web interface to browse the
repository and sending commit emails.
If you have any issue with the Git repository or comments, please do not
hesitate use the nss-pam-ldapd-users mailing list.

This is an update for the 0.7 series that includes two file descriptor
related fixes. The changes should be minimal and have mostly been
available in the 0.8 branch for some time.
A summary of the changes since 0.7.17:
\* ensure that select() is not passed a too high file descriptor to avoid
issues when a large number of file descriptors are open (thanks Adrien
Urban)
\* use FD\_CLOEXEC in NSS and PAM modules to ensure that nslcd file
descriptors are not leaked to child processes
The 0.7 series will only occasionally receive further bugfixes and will
not include any new features. Users of the 0.7 series are encouraged to
consider upgrading to a 0.8 release which is now considered stable and
includes a number of enhancements.

This is an update for the 0.8 series that includes a few bug fixes and
improvements. This should be a reasonably stable and well tested
release.
A summary of the changes since 0.8.11:
\* fix a problem with the sasl\_canonicalize option that would cause
errors on non-SASL enabled systems
\* ensure that the file descriptors in the NSS and PAM modules for
connecting to nslcd are closed on exec in the process
\* allow attribute options in attribute mapping expressions
\* show reconnect messages when failing over to a different LDAP server
or re-establishing the connection to an LDAP server (the message
accidentally got hidden in 0.7.4)
\* fix a problem with the pw\_class attribute in FreeBSD (fixes 0.8.11)
\* more fixes and improvements for Solaris (running under nscd may still
give problems though)
\* small improvement to PAM error logging
\* provide a pynslcd manual page if pynslcd is built

numerous small improvements and new features the biggest changes are:
\* support for Solaris and FreeBSD
\* introduction of pynslcd, an experimental alternative for nslcd
\* addition of a validnames option
\* checking shadow attributes for PAM authorisation
\* support mapping to the objectSid attribute
\* support pam\_unix when not getting shadow information from LDAP
A summary of the changes since 0.8.9:
\* documentation improvements
\* fix a problem that causes the PAM module to prompt for a new password
even though the old one was wrong
\* log successful password change in nslcd
\* install default configuration file with reduced permissions (further
protection for CVE-2009-1073)

expiration when doing authorisation
\* make buffer sizes consistent and grow all buffers holding string
representations of numbers to be able to hold 64-bit numbers
\* update AX\_PTHREAD from autoconf-archive
\* support querying DNS SRV records from a different domain than the
current one (based on a patch by James M. Leddy)
\* fix a problem with uninitialised memory while parsing the tls\_ciphers
option

Release 0.8.2 of nss-pam-ldapd has just been made available which fixes
some bugs and introduces some new features but mainly focusses on
improving the tests to avoid another security problem as was seen in
0.8.0.
A summary of the changes since 0.8.1:
\* fix problem with endless loop on incorrect password
\* fix a communication problem between nslcd and the NSS and PAM modules
when running on Solaris 10
\* fix a compilation issue on systems without HOST\_NAME\_MAX
\* link to the resolv library for hstrerror() on platforms that need it
\* ignore password change requests for users not in LDAP
\* many clean-ups to the tests and added some new tests including some
integration tests for the PAM functionality
\* some smaller code clean-ups and improvements
\* improvements to pynslcd, including implementations for service,
protocol and rpc lookups
\* implement a validnames option that can be used to filter valid user
and group names using a regular expression
\* improvements to the way nslcd shuts down with hanging worker threads
The 0.8 series remains in development mode and several more bigger
changes, enhancements and new features are planned. Users that require a
stable release are encouraged to stay with 0.7 until 0.8 stabilises.

Russell Sim discovered a serious security vulnerability in development
release 0.8.0 of nss-pam-ldapd that allows authentication with an
incorrect password for local user accounts.
The PAM module will erroneously return a success code when the user
cannot be found in LDAP. Exploitability depends on the details of the
PAM configuration but on systems that don't use the minimum\_uid PAM
option it may be possible to log in to any local account, including
root.
This problem only affects the 0.8.0 development release of
nss-pam-ldapd. Earlier releases are not affected.
This problem has been assigned CVE-2011-0438.
More details are available at:

Affected users are advised to apply the attached patch, upgrade to 0.8.1
(which will be released shortly), downgrade to 0.7.13 or disable
nss-pam-ldapd's PAM module.

I'm pleased to announce release 0.8.0 of nss-pam-ldapd. The 0.8 branch
is a new development branch of nss-pam-ldapd in which a number of new
features and implementations are introduced. As such, it isn't the most
stable version of nss-pam-ldapd but users are urged to try out this
release and send feedback.
The 0.7 branch will be supported with bug and security fixes at least
until the 0.8 branch has stabilised.
A summary of the changes since 0.7.13 (some more details further on):
\* include Solaris support developed by Ted C. Cheng of Symas Corporation
\* include an experimental partial implementation of nslcd in Python
(disabled by default, see --enable-pynslcd configure option)
\* implement a nss\_min\_uid option to filter user entries returned by LDAP
\* implement a rootpwmodpw option that allows the root user to change a
user's password without a password prompt
\* try to update the shadowLastChange attribute on password change
\* all log messages now include a description of the request to more
easily track problems when not running in debug mode
\* allow attribute mapping expressions for the userPassword attribute for
passwd, group and shadow entries and by default map it to the
unmatchable password (&quot;\*&quot;) to avoid accidentally leaking password
information
\* numerous compatibility improvements
\* add --with-pam-seclib-dir and --with-pam-ldap-soname configure options
to allow more control of hot to install the PAM module
\* add --with-nss-flavour and --with-nss-maps configure options to
support other C libraries and limit which NSS modules to install
\* allow tilde (~) in user and group names
\* improvements to the timeout mechanism (connections are now actively
timed out using the idle\_timelimit option)
\* set socket timeouts on the LDAP connection to disconnect regardless of
LDAP and possibly TLS handling of connection
\* better disconnect/reconnect handling of error conditions
\* some code improvements and cleanups and several smaller bug fixes
\* all internal string comparisons are now also case sensitive (e.g. for
providing DN to username lookups, etc)
\* signal handling in the daemon was changed to behave more reliable
across different threading implementations
\* nslcd will now always return a positive authorisation result during
authentication to avoid confusing the PAM module when it is only used
for authorisation
\* Debian packaging improvement: implement configuring SASL
authentication using Debconf, based on a patch by Daniel Dehennin

Support for Solaris was kindly provided by Ted C. Cheng of Symas
Corporation but was subsequently updated to simplify the code and to
support both Glibc and Solaris with the same code base. As such, the
current code isn't very well tested and contributions on this are most
welcome. There have been reports of problems with the communication
between the NSS module and nslcd.
The idea with pynslcd is to offer an alternative implementation of nslcd
that has less and easier to maintain code (most modules are about a
third of the size of their C counterpart). This makes it simpler to
implement extra features (e.g. caching). The implementation is currently
still incomplete (mainly missing configuration file parsing, attribute
mapping, proper logging and the rpc, network, netgroup, service,
protocol and hostname maps) but work is under way and it already passes
most of the basic tests in the test environment.
Some more features that may be implemented in the 0.8 series are:
\* updates of the logging system to rate-limit and more cleanly log
warnings
\* integration of FreeBSD support
\* implement better filtering of information passed between NSS layer and
LDAP server (e.g. make user and group name filtering configurable with
regular expression)
\* investigate switching to using environment variables to disable NSS
module
\* implementation of nested groups

With this release the 0.7 series will be in bugfixes-only mode. It will
still receive bugfixes and security support for some time but not any
major new features.
This allows for some more elbow room to introduce some new features in
the 0.8 series. A few interesting features that may make it in are:
\* an experimental Python implementation of nslcd (a very rough
beginning is available)
\* perhaps integrate the FreeBSD code, maybe work on Solaris (Illumos)
support
\* nested groups
\* rootpwmodpw option (see mailing list archives)
\* more autodetection and SASL configuration of the Debian package
\* implement other services in nslcd: sudo and autofs are candidates
\* perhaps rework PAM nslcd protocol to have cleaner support for
currently used functionality
\* have a logging framework to more clearly log invalid entries without
flooding the logs
If you are interested in any of these features or have some important
ones to add please drop a note on the nss-pam-ldapd-users mailing list.
Any input and ideas are appreciated, patches even more so. Also, if you
are willing to work on any improvements just drop by on the mailing
list.

\* add an nss\_initgroups\_ignoreusers option to ignore user name to group
lookups for the specified users
\* add an pam\_authz\_search option to perform a flexible authorisation
check on login (e.g. to restrict which users can login to which hosts,
etc)
\* implement a minimum\_uid option for the PAM module to ignore users that
have a lower numeric user id
\* change the way retries are done to error out quicker if the LDAP
server is down for some time (this should make the system more
responsive when the LDAP server is unavailable) and rename the
reconnect\_maxsleeptime option to reconnect\_retrytime to better
describe the behaviour
\* only log &quot;connected to LDAP server&quot; if the previous connection failed

Subject: CVE-2013-0288 nss-pam-ldapd: FD_SET array index error, leading to
 stack-based buffer overflow

Hello Steve, vendors,

  an array index error, leading to stack-based buffer overflow
flaw was found in the way nss-pam-ldapd, a PAM and nsswitch module
which uses directory servers, performed management of file descriptors
when performing file descriptors activity wait. An attacker could use
this flaw to cause processes with a large number of opened file
descriptors, that performed name lookups to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the process.

Upstream advisory (with patches and further details)
[1] <http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/CVE-2013-0288>

References:
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-0288>

Credit: This issue was found by Garth Mollett.

Red Hat would like to thank Garth Mollett for reporting this
issue, and Arthur de Jong of nss-pam-ldapd upstream for help
with coordination of this advisory.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

# CVE-2013-0288

| **Name** | CVE-2013-0288 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | nss-pam-ldapd before 0.7.18 and 0.8.x before 0.8.11 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by performing a name lookup on an application with a large number of open file descriptors, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow related to incorrect use of the FD\_SET macro. |

# Arthur de Jong

Open Source / Free Software developer

[![Photo of Arthur](arthur6-300x400.jpg)](https://arthurdejong.org)

Hi, I'm
Arthur de Jong.
I am a software engineer with a background in software design,
security and system administration.
I enjoy developing Open Source / Free Software because it helps
others and I learn from the feedback I get.

[Other stuff »](other)

### Open Source / Free Software

I'm an Open Source/Free Software developer since 2001
and develop and maintain a number of [Open Source/Free Software projects](software).
Some of them are continuations or forks of existing projects and some are
developed from scratch.

### Debian developer

I am also a [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
developer since 2003.
The goal of the Debian Project is to create a high-quality operating system
consisting entirely of free software.
I currently maintain [a couple of packages](http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=adejong),
try to be [active](https://contributors.debian.org/contributor/adejong%40debian)
in reporting bugs and occasionally help in fixing bugs.

I work for
[DataExpert](https://www.dataexpert.nl/)
as senior software developer since 2024.

You can also find some
[other assorted stuff](other) on these pages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## MGASA-2013-0071

| **Date:** | February 27nd, 2013 |
| --- | --- |
| **Affected releases:** | 2 |
| **Media:** | Core |

**Description:**

Updated nss-pam-ldapd packages fixes the following security vulnerability:

Garth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the use

of FD\_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow.

An attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to cause a

process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or potentially

execute arbitrary code.

The issue can be triggered in a network daemon by opening a large number

of connections and forcing a name lookup. This would result in a crash

and possibly remote code execution. This issue may also allow local

privilege escalation if a suid program does name lookups and doesn't

close file descriptors inherited from the parent process (CVE-2013-0288).

**Updated Packages:**

i586:

nss-pam-ldapd-0.8.6-3.1.mga2.i586.rpm

nss-pam-ldapd-debug-0.8.6-3.1.mga2.i586.rpm

x86\_64:

nss-pam-ldapd-0.8.6-3.1.mga2.x86\_64.rpm

nss-pam-ldapd-debug-0.8.6-3.1.mga2.x86\_64.rpm

## Synopsis

Important: nss-pam-ldapd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0590)

## Topic

Updated nss-pam-ldapd packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The nss-pam-ldapd packages provide the nss-pam-ldapd daemon (nslcd), which
uses a directory server to lookup name service information on behalf of a
lightweight nsswitch module.

An array index error, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow flaw, was
found in the way nss-pam-ldapd managed open file descriptors. An attacker
able to make a process have a large number of open file descriptors and
perform name lookups could use this flaw to cause the process to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the process. (CVE-2013-0288)

Red Hat would like to thank Garth Mollett for reporting this issue.

All users of nss-pam-ldapd are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain a backported patch to fix this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

**Description:**

Updated nss-pam-ldapd packages fixes the following security vulnerability:

Garth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the use

of FD\_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow.

An attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to cause a

process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or potentially

execute arbitrary code.

The issue can be triggered in a network daemon by opening a large number

of connections and forcing a name lookup. This would result in a crash

and possibly remote code execution. This issue may also allow local

privilege escalation if a suid program does name lookups and doesn't

close file descriptors inherited from the parent process (CVE-2013-0288).

**Updated Packages:**

i586:

nss-pam-ldapd-0.8.6-3.1.mga2.i586.rpm

nss-pam-ldapd-debug-0.8.6-3.1.mga2.i586.rpm

x86\_64:

nss-pam-ldapd-0.8.6-3.1.mga2.x86\_64.rpm

nss-pam-ldapd-debug-0.8.6-3.1.mga2.x86\_64.rpm

SRPMS:

nss-pam-ldapd-0.8.6-3.1.mga2.src.rpm

```
Package: nss-pam-ldapd
Version: 0.7.15+squeeze2
Severity: critical

When trying to get the identity, after establishing the connection
(connect /var/run/nslcd/socket), it uses select to wait on it. If the
filedescriptor is over 1024, it still uses FD_SET to write outside of
the fd_set, and calls select with a max at 1024.

The select won't have any fd to check, and will timeout.

The FD_SET writes outside of the space, and might corrupts memory, and
provide crash.

Exemple provided with binary id. First noticed it after tracing nginx
having *alot* of log files, and crashing less than a minute after
starting.

Thanks for reporting this and providing the detailed test. I guess the
proper solution is to switch to poll() instead of select(). A smaller
change would be to implement a check to see the FD would fit in the set.

trace.log is missing but with bug.c I can reproduce the problem easily.
Thanks.

Btw, I first couldn't reproduce the problem because I had nscd running
(which also may be a good idea in your configuration) so that is at
least a workaround in some cases.

The patch with minimal changes for the 0.7 and 0.8 branches are here:
  <http://arthurdejong.org/viewvc/nss-pam-ldapd?revision=1782&view=revision>
  <http://arthurdejong.org/viewvc/nss-pam-ldapd?revision=1781&view=revision>

With this patch the id command will still fail but it will do so quickly
and memory shouldn't be corrupted. I will work on switching to poll()
instead.

Thanks,

Hi,

I noticed (by chance) there is a problem with the squeeze-security patch
for #690319;  it introduces a regression on kfreebsd and has not built.
 I'm not sure where to find build logs of this, or if they are public,
but I think it is due to using a non-standard EBADFD errno ("file
descriptor in bad state").

Perhaps EBADF ("is not a valid file descriptor" / "bad file number")
would be suitable instead and is more portable;  please consider
attached bug690319-amend-1.diff

Alternatively we could #define EBADFD EBADF on platforms that don't have
it;  please see bug690319-amend-2.diff if that is preferred.

Thanks,
Regards,

I don't think the security build logs are public (even after the
advisory is released) and I hadn't noticed the buil failure before.

This looks like the right approach. The exact value of errno doesn't
make that much of a difference in this case.

I've applied this change upstream and am willing to prepare a
0.7.15+squeeze4 package. I think it's up to the security team to decide
whether this should go to stable or stable-security.

One thing to consider is that I'd also like to fix RC bug #700971 (the
bug report contains the patch that would be applied). People run into
this bug when installing a security update for nss-pam-ldapd.

Thanks for pointing this out,

Thanks for notifying. Yes, indeed nss-pam-ldapd did not build for
kfreebsd-amd64 and kfreebsd-i386. As the FTBFS is a regression for the
kfreebsd builds when appliying the initial fix for [CVE-2013-0288](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0288) I
think we should release an updated version targetting squeeze-security
to include the fix for it and send an updated DSA.

But I'm cc'ing also Moritz explicitly, who released this DSA, to get
an opinion from him.

Regards,
Salvatore

Thanks. Attached is a debdiff with the version I'd like to upload.

As indicated before it also provides a fix for RC bug #700971 which
happens on package upgrades in some environments.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : nss-pam-ldapd
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-0288
Debian Bug     : 690319

Garth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the
use of FD_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd, which provides NSS and PAM modules for
using LDAP as a naming service, can lead to a stack-based buffer
overflow. An attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to
cause a process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or
potentially execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.15+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss-pam-ldapd packages.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```

Garth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the
use of FD_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd can lead to a buffer overflow. An
attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to cause a
process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or potentially
execute arbitrary code.

This problem affects all releases before 0.7.18 and 0.8.11.

This problem has been assigned CVE-2013-0288.

More details are available at:
<http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/CVE-2013-0288>

Users are advised to apply the appropriate patch or upgrade to 0.8.11 or
0.7.18.
