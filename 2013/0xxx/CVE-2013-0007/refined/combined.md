## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft XML Core Services Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2756145)

Published: January 08, 2013 | Updated: December 16, 2013

**Version:** 1.2

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft XML Core Services. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit such a website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes the user to the attacker's website.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft XML Core Services 3.0, Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0, and Microsoft XML Core Services 6.0 on all affected editions of Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows RT; Critical for Microsoft XML Core Services 5.0 when installed with all supported editions of Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Word Viewer, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Expression Web, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, and Microsoft Groove Server 2007; Moderate for Microsoft XML Core Services 3.0, 4.0, and 6.0 on all affected editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft XML Core Services parses XML content. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**Â Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2756145](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2756145) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

## MSXML Integer Truncation Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0006

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Windows parses XML content. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-0006](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-0006).

#### Mitigating Factors for MSXML Integer Truncation Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0006

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit such a website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes the user to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability.

     ```
  2. Restart the system.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the Internet Options dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround**. There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone."
* **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **InternetOptions**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **TrustedSites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Prevent the MSXML 5.0 ActiveX control from being run in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate the MSXML 5.0 for Microsoft Office ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the controls in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow the steps in the article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  To set the kill bit for the MSXML 5.0 for Microsoft Office ActiveX control, follow these steps:

  1. Create a text file named Disable\_MSXML5.reg with the following contents:

     `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00`

     `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e5-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]`

     `"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400`

     `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e5-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]`

     `"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400`

     `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e6-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]`

     `"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400`

     `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e6-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]`

     `"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400`
  2. Double-click the .reg file to apply it to an individual system.
  3. Restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

     **Note** You can also apply the registry change across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see [Group Policy collection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).

#### FAQ for MSXML Integer Truncation Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0006

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) parses XML content, which can corrupt the system state in such a way as to allow an attacker to run arbitrary code.

**What is** **the component affected by the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability affects Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML), which allows customers who use JScript, Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 to develop XML-based applications that provide interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard. For more information, see the MSDN site, [MSXML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms763742.aspx).

**What is Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML)?**

Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) allows customers who use JScript, Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 to develop XML-based applications that provide interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard. For more information, see the MSDN site, [MSXML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms763742.aspx).

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the Internet Options dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround**. There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone."
* **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **InternetOptions**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **TrustedSites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Prevent the MSXML 5.0 ActiveX control from being run in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate the MSXML 5.0 for Microsoft Office ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the controls in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow the steps in the article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  To set the kill bit for the MSXML 5.0 for Microsoft Office ActiveX control, follow these steps:

  1. Create a text file named Disable\_MSXML5.reg with the following contents:

     `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00`

     `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e5-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]`

     `"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400`

     `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e5-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]`

     `"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400`

     `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e6-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]`

     `"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400`

     `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e6-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]`

     `"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400`
  2. Double-click the .reg file to apply it to an individual system.
  3. Restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

     **Note** You can also apply the registry change across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see [Group Policy collection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).

#### FAQ for MSXML XSLT Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0007

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) parses XML content, which can corrupt the system state in such a way as to allow an attacker to run arbitrary code.

**What is the component affected by the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability affects Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) which allows customers who use JScript, Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 to develop XML-based applications that provide interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard. For more information, see the MSDN site, [MSXML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms763742.aspx).

**What is Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML)?**

Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) allows customers who use JScript, Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 to develop XML-based applications that provide interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard. For more information, see the MSDN site, [MSXML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms763742.aspx).

**What version of Microsoft XML Core Services is installed on my system?**

Microsoft XML Core Services is included in additional non-operating system software from Microsoft and is also available as separate downloads. For information about the different Microsoft XML Core Services versions that are available and the products that install them, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 269238](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/269238).

**Note** Depending on which version of Microsoft XML Core Services you have installed on your system, you may be offered more than one security update from this security bulletin.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted website that is designed to invoke MSXML through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.

Non-Microsoft web applications and services that utilize the MSXML library for parsing XML could also be vulnerable to this attack.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a website for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft XML Core Services parses XML content.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

The security updates for MSXML 3.0 support the following setup switches:

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

The security updates for MSXML 4.0 and MSXML 6.0 support the following setup switches:

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

The security updates for MSXML 3.0 and MSXML 6.0 support the following setup switches:

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h,** **/help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).

The security update for MSXML 4.0 supports the following setup switches:

| Switch | Description |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| **/log<LogFile>** | Equivalent of /l\* <LogFile> |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note**Â Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note**Â Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

**Verifying That** **the Update Has Been Applied**

* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note**Â Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note**Â Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note**Â Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note**Â Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

* 10/08/2009
## In this article

Applies To: Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2003 with SP1, Windows Server 2003 with SP2

**In this section**

* Group Policy Tools
* Group Policy Settings
* Group Policy WMI Classes
* Related Information

This section summarizes the tools and settings associated with Group Policy.

## Group Policy Tools

The following is a list of administrative tools associated with Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy administrative tools, see the following topics in this collection:

* [Group Policy Administrative Tools](cc782611%28v%3Dws.10%29)
* [Group Policy Object Editor Tools and Settings](cc758588%28v%3Dws.10%29)
* [Group Policy Management Console Technical Reference](cc778172%28v%3Dws.10%29)
* [What Is Resultant Set of Policy?](cc758010%28v%3Dws.10%29)

For information about tools specific to Group Policy extensions, see the appropriate [Group Policy Components](cc776182%28v%3Dws.10%29) topics in this collection. For more information about other Resource Kit tools, see the WindowsÂ ServerÂ 2003 Deployment Kit Tools page.

#### GPUpdate.exe

This tool is used for refreshing local and Active Directory policy settings on the computer from which you run the **GPUpdate** command.

##### Category

This command-line tool is included in WindowsÂ XP and Windows ServerÂ 2003.

##### Version compatibility

You can use GPUpdate locally on WindowsÂ XP and higher computers to refresh policy immediately. On computers running WindowsÂ 2000, this behavior is provided by the using the secedit.exe command line tool, with a specific parameter.

GPUpdate refreshes local Group Policy settings and Group Policy settings that are stored in Active Directory, including security settings, on the computer from which it is run. This command supersedes the now obsolete **/refreshpolicy** option for the secedit command line tool. For more information about GPUpdate, type **GPUpdate /?** at the command line.

#### GPResult.exe

GPResult.exe is a Group Policy tool for examining the settings applied during Group Policy refresh.

##### Category

There are two versions of GPResult: One shipped with the WindowsÂ 2000 Resource Kit; the other is included with WindowsÂ XP and Windows ServerÂ 2003. The WindowsÂ 2000 version runs only locally on WindowsÂ 2000. The windows ServerÂ 2003 version runs locally or remotely on WindowsÂ XP or Windows ServerÂ 2003.

The different versions are not compatible.

##### Version compatibility

GPResult utilizes Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) data. You can use GPResult that shipped with Windows ServerÂ 2003 family on WindowsÂ XP and higher computers. You can use GPResult that shipped with WindowsÂ 2000 Resource Kit for WindowsÂ 2000.

GPResult for Windows ServerÂ 2003 displays Group Policy settings and Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) for a user or a computer. Because you can apply overlapping levels of policies to any computer or user, the Group Policy feature generates a resulting set of policies at logon. GPResult displays the resulting set of policies that were enforced on the computer for the specified user at logon.

GPResult for WindowsÂ 2000 estimates the Group Policy settings that would be applied at a specific computer. Full documentation for this version of GPResult is available in the readme file distributed with the tool.

#### Dcgpofix.exe: Dcgpofix

##### Category

Dcgpofix ships with Windows ServerÂ 2003.

##### Version compatibility

You can run Dcgpofix only on servers running Windows ServerÂ 2003 family. This tool can restore default domain policy and default domain controllers policy to their original state after installation, except for some security-related settings that are impossible to return to their exact original state. When you run Dcgpofix, you will lose any changes made to these Group Policy objects. For more information about Dcgpofix, type **Dcgpofix /?** at the command line.

This tool should be used as a last-resort disaster-recovery tool. A better solution is to use GPMC to back up and restore these GPOs.

#### GPMonitor.exe: Group Policy Monitor Tool

##### Category

Group Policy Monitor tool is included in the WindowsÂ ServerÂ 2003 Deployment Kit.

##### Version compatibility

The Group Policy Monitor tool works on WindowsÂ XP and higher computers. Group Policy Monitor tool collects Group Policy information at every Group Policy refresh and sends that information to a centralized location that you specify. You can then use the Group Policy Monitor user interface (UI) to view the data. The Group Policy Monitor UI can provide a historical view of policy changes. The UI is also designed to make it easy to navigate through historical snapshots of data and trace changes. For more information about the Group Policy Monitor tool, type **GPMonitor /?** at the command line. You can find full documentation for the Group Policy Monitor tool in the WindowsÂ ServerÂ 2003 Deployment Kit Tools.

#### GPOTool.exe: Group Policy Verification Tool

##### Category

Group Policy Verification tool is included in the WindowsÂ ServerÂ 2003 Deployment Kit.

##### Version compatibility

The Group Policy Verification tool works on WindowsÂ 2000 and higher computers. You use Group Policy Verification tool to check the health of the Group Policy objects on domain controllers. The tool checks GPOs for consistency on each domain controller in your domain. The tool also determines whether the policies are valid and displays detailed information about replicated Group Policy objects (GPOs).

GPOTool.exe ships with the Microsoft WindowsÂ 2003 Server Resource Kit and is also available as a free download at the Gpotool.exe: Group Policy Verification Tool page.

For more information about the Group Policy Verification tool, type **GPOTool /?** at the command line. You can find full documentation for Group Policy Verification tool in the WindowsÂ ServerÂ 2003 Deployment Kit Tools.

#### AdmX.exe: ADM File Parser

##### Category

The ADM File Parser (AdmX) is a command-line tool that enables an administrator to export Group Policy settings to a tab-delimited text file. The administrator can then use the text produced by ADM File Parser (AdmX) to find changes for the policy settings between different versions of the operating systems. AdmX is for use only with policies based on administrative templates.

##### Version compatibility

The AdmX.exe tool runs on WindowsÂ 2000, Windows ServerÂ 2003, and WindowsÂ XP Professional. AdmX.exe also requires the MicrosoftÂ .NET FrameworkÂ 1.0.

Administrators use AdmX.exe to extract policy setting information from .adm files and to list differences between two .adm files.

For more information about the ADM File Parser, type **AdmX.exe /?** at the command line.

#### Other Tools

For information about tools specific to Group Policy extensions, see the appropriate [Group Policy Components](cc776182%28v%3Dws.10%29) Tools topics in this collection.

## Group Policy Settings

Many Group Policy settings are configurable within the Administrative Template (.adm) files supplied with WindowsÂ 2000 and Windows ServerÂ 2003. Administrators can access these files from the Group Policy Object Editor for a specific GPO, and can configure Group Policy settings contained in the template files.

A registry setting exists for a Group Policy template setting only when the setting state has been changed from **Not Configured** to either **Enabled** or **Disabled**. You can change the setting state from the appropriate Administrative Template node in the Group Policy Object Editor.

To download a complete reference to the Group Policy settings in the .adm files supplied with Windows ServerÂ 2003, see the Group Policy Settings Reference for Windows ServerÂ 2003. This reference is in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format.

For a reference to settings specific to Group Policy behavior, and for a list of registry locations that are associated with Group Policy on the domain controller, target, or both, see the [Group Policy Object Editor Tools and Settings](cc758588%28v%3Dws.10%29) topic in this collection.

For a reference to settings specific to Group Policy extensions, see the appropriate [Group Policy Components](cc776182%28v%3Dws.10%29) topics in this collection.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 â Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 â Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 â Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 â Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products.Â Likewise, theÂ rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.Â Â In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."Â  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 isÂ â2âÂ and the rating for Windows 7 isÂ â1â, the rating will reflect â1â.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** â A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** â The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security updateâs release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month â thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

* Article
* 08/31/2016
## In this article

Updated: April 14, 2016

## Overview

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration places your server and Internet Explorer in a configuration that decreases the exposure of your server to potential attacks that can occur through Web content and application scripts. As a result, some Web sites may not display or perform as expected.

This topic contains the following information:

* Internet Explorer security zones
* How to browse when Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled
* Effects of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration

  + Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration and Terminal Services
  + Effects of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration on the Internet Explorer user experience
* Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration

  + Add sites to the Trusted sites zone
  + Add sites to the Local intranet zone
  + Apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users
  + Apply Internet Explorer security settings manually on your server
  + Upgrading from previous versions of Internet Explorer
* Browser security best practices

## Internet Explorer security zones

In Internet Explorer, you can configure security settings for two of the built-in security zones: the **Local intranet** zone and the **Trusted sites** zone. You cannot change the security settings for the **Internet** zone and the **Restricted sites** zone.

Note

To change security settings, you must open Internet Explorer in administrator mode, even if you are logged in as a local administrator. To open Internet Explorer in administrator mode, right-click **Internet Explorer**, and then click **Run as administrator**.

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration assigns security levels to these zones as follows:

* For the **Internet** zone, the security level is set to **High**.
* For the **Trusted sites** zone, the security level is set to **Medium**, which allows browsing of many Internet sites.
* For the **Local intranet** zone, the security level is set to **Medium-low**, which allows your user credentials (user name and password) to be sent automatically to sites and applications that need them.
* For the **Restricted sites** zone, the security level is set to **High**.
* All Internet and intranet sites are assigned to the **Internet** zone by default. Intranet sites are not part of the **Local intranet** zone unless you explicitly add them to this zone.

## How to browse when Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled

Enhanced Security Configuration increases the level of security on your server, but it may also affect Internet browsing in the following ways:

* Because ActiveX controls and scripting are disabled, Internet sites may not display in Internet Explorer as expected and applications that use the Internet may not work correctly. If you trust an Internet site and need it to be functional, you can add that site to the **Trusted sites** zone in Internet Explorer. If you attempt to browse an Internet site that uses scripting or ActiveX controls, Internet Explorer will prompt you to consider adding the site to the **Trusted sites** zone. You should add the site to the **Trusted sites** zone only if you are completely confident that the site is trustworthy and that the URL to be added is indeed the correct one. For more information, see Add sites to the Trusted sites zone.
* Access to intranet sites, Web-based applications that run over a local intranet, and other files on network shares may be restricted. If you trust an intranet site or share and need it to be functional, you can add it to the **Local intranet** zone. For more information, see Add sites to the Local intranet zone.

## Effects of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration adjusts the security levels for the existing security zones. The following table describes how each zone is affected.

| Zone | Security level | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internet | High | This zone has the same security settings as the **Restricted sites** zone. All Internet and intranet sites are assigned to this zone by default. Web pages may not display in Internet Explorer as expected and applications that require the browser may not work correctly because scripts, ActiveX controls, and file downloads have been disabled. If you trust an Internet site and need it to be functional, you can add that site to the **Trusted sites** zone in Internet Explorer. For more information, see Add sites to the Trusted sites zone. Access to scripts, executable files, and other files on Universal Naming Convention (UNC) shares is restricted unless the share is added to the **Local intranet** zone explicitly. For more information, see Add sites to the Local intranet zone. |
| Local intranet | Medium-low | When visiting intranet sites, you may be repeatedly prompted for credentials (your user name and password) as a result of Enhanced Security Configuration. Enhanced Security Configuration disables the automatic detection of intranet sites. If you want your credentials to be sent automatically to certain intranet sites, add those sites to the **Local intranet** zone. For more information, see Add sites to the Local intranet zone. Do not add Internet sites to the **Local intranet** zone because your credentials will be sent automatically to the site if they are requested. |
| Trusted sites | Medium | This zone is for the Internet sites whose content you trust. For more information, see Add sites to the Trusted sites zone. |
| Restricted sites | High | This zone contains sites you do not trust, such as sites that may damage your computer or data if you attempt to download or run files from them. |

Enhanced Security Configuration also adjusts the Internet Explorer extensibility and security settings to further reduce exposure to possible future security threats. These settings can be found on the **Advanced** tab of the **Internet Options** dialog box in Internet Explorer. The following table describes the settings that are affected.

| Name | Default setting | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enable third-party browser extensions | Off | Disables features you installed for use with Internet Explorer that may have been created by companies other than Microsoft. |
| Play sounds in Web pages | Off | Disables music and other sounds. |
| Play animations in Web pages | Off | Disables animations. |
| Check for server certificate revocation | On | Automatically checks a Web site's certificate to see whether it has been revoked before accepting it as valid. |
| Do not save encrypted pages to disk | On | Disables saving secured information in your Temporary Internet Files folder. |
| Empty Temporary Internet Files folder when browser is closed | On | Automatically clears the Temporary Internet Files folder when you close the browser. |
| Warn if changing between secure and not secure mode | On | Displays a warning that the browser is redirecting from a secure Web site to a non-secure Web site. |
| Enable memory protection to help mitigate online attacks | Off | Enables Data Execution Prevention (DEP) to help mitigate online attacks. This option applies to Windows ServerÂ 2008 only. |

These changes reduce the functionality in Web pages, Web-based applications, local network resources, and applications that use a browser to display Help, support, and general user assistance.

For more information about using the **Local intranet** or **Trusted sites** zones' inclusion lists, see Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

When Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled:

* The Microsoft Update Web site is added to the **Trusted sites** zone. This allows you to continue to get important updates for your operating system.
* The Windows error reporting site is added to the **Trusted sites** zone. This allows you to report problems encountered with your operating system and search for fixes.
* Several local computer sites (such as https://localhost, https://localhost, and hcp://system) are added to the **Local intranet** zone. This allows applications and code to work locally so that you can complete common administrative tasks.
* The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) level is set to **Medium** for the **Trusted sites** zone. If you want to change the P3P level for any zone other than the **Internet** zone, go to the **Privacy** tab of the **Internet Options** dialog box, and click **Import** to apply a custom privacy policy. For sample privacy policies, see How to Create a Customized Privacy Import File ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=12939](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=12939)).

## Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration and Terminal Services

Enhanced Security Configuration applies to different user accounts according to the type of installation. The following table describes how the users are affected.

| Type of installation | Enhanced Security Configuration is applied to Administrators | Enhanced Security Configuration is applied to Power Users | Enhanced Security Configuration is applied to Limited Users | Enhanced Security Configuration is applied to Restricted Users |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Upgrade of the operating system | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Unattended installation of the operating system | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Manual installation of Terminal Services | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Note

During the manual Terminal Services installation, you are prompted to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration for users. This allows users to run a terminal server session without restrictions.

System administrators should carefully consider the risks of using of internet-connected applications in a multiuser server before proceeding to disable Enhanced Security Configuration. While disabling Enhanced Security Configuration will improve web browsing experience for users, it will increase the risk of users becoming the victims of web-hosted attacks that can then lead to a system-wide security compromise.

For more information about applying Enhanced Security Configuration, see Apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users.

## Effects of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration on the Internet Explorer user experience

The following table describes how Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration affects each user's experience with Internet Explorer.

| Task | Can be completed by Administrators | Can be completed by Power Users | Can be completed by Limited Users | Can be completed by Restricted Users |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Turn on or off Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration | Yes | No | No | No |
| Adjust the security level for a particular zone in Internet Explorer | Yes     | Note | | --- | | You can change security settings only for the **Local intranet** zone and the **Trusted sites** zone. | | Yes, on computers running Windows Server?2003 No, on computers running Windows ServerÂ 2008 | No | No |
| Add sites to the **Trusted sites** zone | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Add sites to the **Local intranet** zone | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

All other Internet Explorer tasks can be completed by all user groups unless you choose to restrict user access further.

Overview

## Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is designed to reduce your server's exposure to security threats. To ensure that you get the most benefit from Enhanced Security Configuration, consider these browser management recommendations:

* All Internet and intranet sites are assigned to the **Internet** zone by default. If you trust an Internet or intranet site and need it to be functional, add the Internet site to the **Trusted sites** zone, and add the intranet site to the **Local intranet** zone. For more information about the security levels for each zone, see Effects of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* If you want to run a browser-based client application over the Internet, you should add the Web page that hosts the application to the **Trusted sites** zone. For more information, see Add sites to the Trusted sites zone.
* If you want to run a browser-based client application over a protected and secure local intranet, you should add the Web page that hosts the application to the **Local intranet** zone. For more information, see Add sites to the Local intranet zone.
* Add internal sites and local servers to the **Local intranet** zone to make sure you have access to, and can run, applications from your servers.
* Use unattend.txt to add intranet sites and UNC servers to the **Local intranet** zone inclusion list as part of the installation process. For more information, see the Readme file in Deploy.cab on the Windows Server?2003 product CD.
* Use client computers to download drivers, service packs, and other updates. Avoid any browsing from servers.
* If you use disk imaging to install operating systems on your servers, add the intranet sites and UNC servers you trust to the **Local intranet** zone, and add the Internet sites that you trust to the **Trusted sites** zone on the base image. You can then change the list on images for different server types and needs.

## Add sites to the Trusted sites zone

When Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled on your server, the security settings for all Internet sites are set to **High**. If you trust a Web page and need it to be functional, you can add that page to the **Trusted sites** zone in Internet Explorer.

1. Navigate to the site that you want to add.
2. On the status bar, double-click the security zone name (such as **Internet**) to open the **Internet Security** dialog box.
3. Click **Trusted sites**, and then click **Sites**.
4. In the **Trusted sites** dialog box, click **Add** to add the site to the list, and then click **Close**.
5. Refresh the page to view the site from its new zone.
6. Check the status bar of the browser to confirm that the site is in the **Trusted sites** zone.

**Notes**

* If an Internet site tries to use scripting or ActiveX controls, a dialog box will prompt you to add the Internet site to the **Trusted sites** zone. If you have disabled this dialog box, you can re-enable it in Internet Explorer. On the **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**. On the **Advanced** tab, select **Display enhanced security configuration dialog**.
* A Web page can be part of only one zone at a time. You cannot add a page to both the **Trusted sites** zone and the **Local intranet** zone.
* When you add a Web page to the **Trusted sites** zone, you are adding the domain for that page. Therefore, all pages within that domain are also added. For example, if you add *<https://www.microsoft.com/windows/>* to your **Trusted sites** zone, you are adding *<https://www.microsoft.com>*. If you then want to view the Help and Support site, you will have to add *<https://support.microsoft.com>* separately, because the Help and Support site is a separate domain.
* Internet Explorer maintains two different lists of sites for the **Trusted sites** zone. One list is in effect when Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled, and a separate list is in effect when Enhanced Security Configuration is disabled. When you add a Web page to the **Trusted sites** zone, you are adding it only to the list that is currently in effect.
* You can use wildcard characters to add all subdomains for a given domain. For example, you can add *\*.microsoft.com* to the list, which adds both *[www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com)* and *support.microsoft.com*.
* Many Internet sites use more than one domain to host their content. You may have to add several domains to the **Trusted sites** zone to have full functionality for one site.
* During installation, you can add many sites at one time to the **Trusted sites** zone by using certain settings in unattend.txt. For more information, see the Readme file in Deploy.cab on the Windows Server?2003 product CD. You can also use Group Policy to add and manage multiple sites. For more information, see the Microsoft Windows Server?2003 Deployment Kit ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=4298](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=4298)).

## Add sites to the Local intranet zone

When Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled, the security settings for all intranet sites are set to **High**. As a result, you are prompted for your credentials (your user name and password) each time you visit intranet sites that have not been added to the **Local intranet** zone. If you routinely use intranet sites and you know those sites are trustworthy, you can add them to the **Local intranet** zone in Internet Explorer.

1. Navigate to the local intranet site that you want to add.
2. On the status bar, double-click the security zone name (such as **Internet**) to open the **Internet Security** dialog box.
3. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Sites**.
4. In the **Local intranet** dialog box, click **Add** to add the site to the list, and then click **Close**.
5. Refresh the page to view the site from its new zone.
6. Check the status bar of the browser to confirm that the site is in the **Local intranet** zone.

**Notes**

* Do not add Internet sites to the **Local intranet** zone because your credentials are sent automatically to the site if they are requested.
* A Web page can be part of only one zone at a time. You cannot add a page to both the **Trusted sites** zone and the **Local intranet** zone.
* Enhanced Security Configuration also restricts access to scripts, executable files, and other potentially unsafe files on a UNC path unless it is added to the **Local intranet** zone explicitly. For example, if you want to access *\\server\share\setup.exe*, you must add *\\server* to the **Local intranet** zone.
* When you add a Web page to the **Trusted sites** zone, you are adding the domain for that page. Therefore, all pages within that domain are also added. For example, if you add *<https://www.microsoft.com/windows/>* to your **Trusted sites** zone, you are adding *<https://www.microsoft.com>*. If you then want to view the Help and Support site, you will have to add *<https://support.microsoft.com>* separately, because the Help and Support site is a separate domain.
* Internet Explorer maintains two different lists of sites for the **Local intranet** zone. One list is in effect when Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled, and a separate list is in effect when Enhanced Security Configuration is disabled. When you add a Web site to the **Local intranet** zone, you are adding it only to the list that is currently in effect.
* During installation you can add many sites at one time to the **Local intranet** zone by using certain settings in unattend.txt. For more information, see the Readme file in Deploy.cab on the Windows Server?2003 product CD. You can also use Group Policy to add and manage multiple sites. For more information, see the Microsoft Windows Server?2003 Deployment Kit. ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=4298](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=4298)).

## Apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration allows you to control the level of Internet Explorer access allowed to certain user groups on your server. The steps for applying Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users are different for Windows Server?2003 and Windows ServerÂ 2008.

### To apply Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users by using a computer running Windows Server?2003

1. Log on to the computer with a user account that is a member of the local Administrators group.
2. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
3. Click **Add or Remove Programs**, and then click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
4. Select the **Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration** check box, and then click **Details**.
5. Select the user group or groups that you want to apply Enhanced Security Configuration to (**Administrators group** or **All other user groups**), and then click **OK**.
6. Click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.
7. Restart Internet Explorer to apply Enhanced Security Configuration.

### To apply Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users by using a computer running Windows Server?2008

1. Log on to the computer with a user account that is a member of the local Administrators group.
2. Click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Server Manager**.
3. If the **User Account Control** dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click **Continue**.
4. Under **Security Information**, click **Configure IE?ESC**.

Note

Server Manager opens with the same window that was in use when it was last closed. If you do not see the **Security Information** section, click **Server Manager** in the console tree.

5. Under **Administrators**, click **On (Recommended)** or **Off**, depending on your desired configuration.
6. Under **Users**, click **On (Recommended)** or **Off**, depending on your desired configuration.
7. Click **OK**.
8. Restart Internet Explorer to apply Enhanced Security Configuration.

**Notes**

* When you apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to the Administrators group, the settings are applied to administrators. For Windows Server?2003, when you apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to **All other user groups**, the settings are applied to all groups except for the Administrators group. For Windows ServerÂ 2008, when you apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to **Users**, the settings are applied to all groups except for the Administrators group.
* For more information about Internet Explorer security zones, see About URL Security Zone Templates ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=12658](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=12658)).
* When you apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to any user group while Internet Explorer is open, you must exit Internet Explorer and restart it for the changes to take effect.

## Apply Internet Explorer security settings manually on your server

If you do not use Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration in your environment, you can use the **Internet Options** dialog box in Internet Explorer to manually apply the security settings on your server.

### To manually apply Internet Explorer security settings

1. Open Internet Explorer.
2. Click **Tools**, and then click **Internet Options**.
3. On the **Security** tab, select the zone that you want to adjust: **Local intranet** or **Trusted sites**.

Note

You cannot change the security level of the **Internet** zone and the **Restricted sites** zone.

4. Under **Security level for this zone**, click **Default level** to use the default security level for the zone, or click **Custom level** and then select the settings you want.
5. Click **OK** to close the **Internet Options** dialog box.

**Notes**

* For **Restricted sites**, click **Custom level**, and then click a level in the **Reset to** list.
* For more information about Internet Explorer security zones, see About URL Security Zone Templates ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=12658](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=12658)).

## Upgrading from previous versions of Internet Explorer

When upgrading to a later version of Internet Explorer, the settings from the previous version are retained. If Internet Explorer is using Enhanced Security Configuration and is upgraded to a later version, it will continue to use Enhanced Security Configuration. If Internet Explorer is not using Enhanced Security Configuration and is upgraded to a later version, it will not have this feature turned on during the upgrade.

**Notes**

* Browser customizations are always retained during an Internet Explorer upgrade. If Internet Explorer was using Enhanced Security Configuration and you made a configuration change, the Internet Explorer upgrade would retain that change.
* If you remove a version of Internet Explorer that is using Enhanced Security Configuration, the previous version will continue to use Enhanced Security Configuration. This is true when removing a version of Internet Explorer that is not using Enhanced Security Configuration. As with the Internet Explorer upgrade, any customizations to it will be retained in the uninstallation scenario as well.

Overview

## Browser security best practices

Using servers for Internet browsing does not adhere to sound security practices because Internet browsing increases the exposure of your server to potential security attacks. Regardless of the browser you use, you should restrict browsing on your server.

To reduce the risk to your server of potential attacks from malicious Web-based content:

* Do not use servers for browsing general Web content.
* Use client computers to download drivers, service packs, and other updates.
* Do not view Web sites that you cannot confirm are secure.
* Use a limited user account instead of an administrator account for general Web browsing.
* Use Group Policy to keep unauthorized users from making inappropriate changes to browser security settings.
