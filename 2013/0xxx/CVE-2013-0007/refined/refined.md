  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) parses XML content, which can corrupt the system state in such a way as to allow an attacker to run arbitrary code. Specifically, this vulnerability is related to the way MSXML processes XSLT transformations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper parsing of XML content leading to memory corruption."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution; If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted webpage designed to invoke MSXML through Internet Explorer.",
       "Compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements.",
      "Non-Microsoft web applications and services that utilize the MSXML library for parsing XML."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to host a website with specially crafted XML content and convince a user to visit the website (e.g., by clicking a link in an email or instant message).",
    "more_info": "This vulnerability is related to the way MSXML handles XSLT transformations. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft XML Core Services parses XML content. The vulnerability affects Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) which allows customers who use JScript, Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 to develop XML-based applications that provide interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard."
