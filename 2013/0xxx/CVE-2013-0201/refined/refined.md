Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to potential vulnerabilities:

**Commit b8e0309 (First Content):**

*   **Root Cause:** The commit modifies the `mimetypeIcon` function in `lib/helper.php` to replace both forward slashes (`/`) and backslashes (`\`) with hyphens (`-`). This is likely done to sanitize MIME types for use in filenames or other contexts where special characters could cause issues.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The change aims to address potential issues with special characters in MIME types.  While the commit itself is a fix, it suggests a previous vulnerability where unsanitized MIME types could have caused problems in file handling or display, though this is not specified, this commit fixes it by sanitizing the mime type.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Without the fix, it's possible that an attacker could have crafted a malicious MIME type string that could lead to a number of exploits, such as Cross Site Scripting, or other client side vulnerabilties if not escaped correctly.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker needs to upload or set a file's mimetype to a crafted malicious string.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to control the mime type of a file.

**Commit 4e2b834 (Second Content):**

*   **Root Cause:** This commit changes how the `resetpassword.php` script retrieves the user and token parameters. It replaces `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']` with `$_GET['user']` and `$_GET['token']`, sanitizing them using `htmlentities()`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability fixed by this change lies in using `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']` directly. This approach is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, as an attacker could inject malicious code into the query string, which would then be reflected in the HTML output. The fix here uses `$_GET` which is parsed differently and would make it harder to exploit.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker could craft a malicious URL with injected JavaScript in the query string. This URL would be sent to a user who's trying to reset their password through the web application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious URL to a user, that the user will click on.

**Summary of Findings:**

The provided content shows two separate commit fixes:
1. The first commit (b8e0309) addresses how mime types are handled and prevents malicious mime types from being used.
2. The second commit (4e2b834) addresses an XSS vulnerability via the `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']` variable.  It shows the fix using `$_GET` to retrieve user and token parameters and applying `htmlentities` to properly sanitize inputs.

**Relevance to CVE-2013-0201:**

Based on the provided content, **it's unlikely that either of these commits are directly related to CVE-2013-0201** since the description of the CVE is not provided and there is no indication in the commits that indicate a direct relation to it. However, they address security vulnerabilities in their own right. If the CVE is related to XSS vulnerabilities then commit 4e2b834 might be relevant.

**Response:** NOINFO
