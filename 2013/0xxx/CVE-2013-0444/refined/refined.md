{
  "CVE-2013-0444": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way Java Beans MethodFinder handled its method lookup cache. A restricted code could possibly use this flaw to obtain access to method previously looked up by a privileged code. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient checks in the MethodFinder's method lookup cache.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Improper handling of cached data"
    ],
    "Impact": "An untrusted Java application or applet could bypass Java sandbox restrictions, potentially gaining unauthorized access to methods previously accessed by privileged code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation of untrusted Java applications",
      "Exploitation of untrusted Java applets"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to execute untrusted Java applications or applets."
