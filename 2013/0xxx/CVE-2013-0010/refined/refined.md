Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-0010:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation within the System Center Operations Manager web console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a non-persistent XSS flaw. This means that malicious scripts aren't stored on the server but are injected into the user's browser when they visit a specially crafted URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the user's browser. This allows the attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the targeted user, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control.
*   **Spoofing Content:** The injected script could modify the displayed content of the web page, tricking the user.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The script could be used to steal sensitive information accessible to the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted URL:** An attacker crafts a URL containing malicious script.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the victim to visit the malicious URL. This could be achieved through:
    *   Email links
    *   Instant Messenger links
    *   Links on compromised websites
    *   Redirects from other websites
*   **Compromised/Malicious Websites:** Attackers could embed the malicious URL in compromised sites or on sites that accept user-generated content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on the crafted URL. This can be achieved through various social engineering techniques.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable server; the attack is client-side.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability affects Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2007 SP1 and R2.
* The vulnerability is rated as "Important"
* Microsoft released an update to address the vulnerability by modifying the way that System Center Operations Manager accepts input.
*   The advisory includes a workaround using Internet Explorer's XSS filter.
