- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Notes does not filter `<applet>` tags within HTML emails, allowing the loading of arbitrary Java applets from remote sources. Additionally, the default parsing of arbitrary JAVA and Javascript code in emails is the root cause.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unfiltered parsing of HTML emails allowing arbitrary JAVA and Javascript execution. Specifically, the lack of filtering of `<applet>` tags.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the user viewing emails in IBM Notes, potentially leading to information disclosure and other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted email containing malicious Java applets or Javascript code to a vulnerable IBM Notes user. The attack is triggered upon email preview or opening.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send emails to a user using the vulnerable IBM Notes client. No authentication or specific position on the network is required.
