Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0717:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw present in the web management interface of multiple NEC Aterm mobile routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The web interface lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to potentially trick a logged-in user's browser into sending malicious requests to the router.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If a user browses a malicious webpage while logged into the router's administration panel, an attacker can:
  - Initialize the router's settings to default values.
  - Force the router to reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious HTML file. This can be achieved by phishing or other social engineering techniques.
- The malicious website will contain code that crafts a request to the router's web management interface that will execute administrative functions (such as initialization or reboot).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the user/router. The attack can be launched remotely over the internet as long as the user is logged into the router's web interface.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page/file containing a CSRF exploit.
- No authentication is required from the attacker, as they are leveraging the existing user's session/authentication.
- The user must be convinced to take a standard action that does not feel harmful to most users such as clicking a link or viewing a file.
- Some expertise and/or luck may be needed to craft the exploit, but it is not considered highly complex.

**Affected Products (Extracted from multiple sources):**
- Aterm WM3450RN
- Aterm WM3600R
- Aterm WR8160N
- Aterm WR8170N
- Aterm WR8370N
- Aterm WR8600N
- Aterm WR8700N
- Aterm WR9500N
- All Aterm WiMAX router products except WM3800R
- Aterm wireless LAN access points released before 2011

**Mitigation:**
- **Firmware Update:** NEC released firmware updates to address the vulnerability for some affected models.
- **Workaround:** For devices without updated firmware, users should close their web browsers after configuring the router and should delete Basic Authentication information.
