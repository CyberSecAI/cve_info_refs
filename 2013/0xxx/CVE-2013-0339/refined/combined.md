How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVEs for libxml2 and expat internal and external XML entity expansion

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

So here are the CVE's for the two big ones, libxml2 and expat. Both
are affected by the expansion of internal entities (which can be used
to consume resources) and external entities (which can cause a denial
of service against other services, be used to port scan, etc.).

To be clear:

====================
Internal entity expansion refers to the exponential/quadratic/fast
linear expansion of XML entities, e.g.:
====================
<!DOCTYPE xmlbomb [
<!ENTITY a "1234567890" >
<!ENTITY b "&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;">
<!ENTITY c "&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;">
<!ENTITY d "&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;">
]>
<bomb>&d;</bomb>

or

<!DOCTYPE bomb [
<!ENTITY a "xxxxxxx... a couple of ten thousand chars">
]>
<bomb>&a;&a;&a;... repeat</bomb>

Which causes resources to be consumed

====================
External entity expansion refers to the loading of external resources
such as XML entities from another server or a local file:
====================
<!DOCTYPE external [
<!ENTITY ee SYSTEM "<http://www.example.org/some.xml>">
]>
<root>&ee;</root>

<!DOCTYPE external [
<!ENTITY ee SYSTEM "file:///PATH/TO/simple.xml">
]>
<root>&ee;</root>

Which can cause resources to be consumed or can result in port
scanning /application scanning information being sent to the attacker.

So the CVE's to use:

Please use CVE-2013-0338 for libxml2 internal entity expansion

Please use CVE-2013-0339 for libxml2 external entities expansion

Please use CVE-2013-0340 for expat internal entity expansion

Please use CVE-2013-0341 for expat external entities expansion

If you know of other XML libraries that are vulnerable (and open
source =) please let oss-sec know so we can assign CVEs.

```

libxml has an API to disable external entity expansion. Applications
linked against libxml, can use this API if they dont have enough
protections built-in. For this reason we believe that the
responsibility for correctly handling XEE lies with the app. and not
the library.

Subject: Re-evaluating expat/libxml2 CVE assignments

Various CVEs were assigned to XML-related issues in expat and libxml2
at:

<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/22/3>

CVE-2013-0338 - libxml2 internal entity expansion

CVE-2013-0339 - libxml2 external entities expansion

CVE-2013-0340 - expat internal entity expansion

CVE-2013-0341 - expat external entities expansion

As I noted in <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/21/24>, for
novel situations such as these, sometimes we might change directions after
we learn more.

After some investigation, the MITRE CNA team believes we should probably
REJECT CVE-2013-0341 and shift responsibility to application developers.

For CVE-2013-0340 and CVE-2013-0339, there are "workarounds" available for
application developers, although such workarounds may be very expensive to
develop, and this might place "too much" responsibility to the developers
- so, these assignments may still be OK.  It is still worth discussion.

CVE-2013-0338 still seems OK as is.

CVE-2013-0341 - expat external entities expansion
-------------------------------------------------

In <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/23/1>, Kurt says "I
think it's common enough to warrant [assignment]," but Florian Weimer
points out that expat doesn't resolve external entities directly.
Instead - as described (or quoted?) in detail by Kurt - "Expat does
not read or parse external entities directly."  The developer using
expat has to explicitly set ExternalEntityRefHandler, then create "a
subsidiary parser with XML_ExternalEntityParserCreate".

Since the programmer using expat has to do the work to define and set
up their ExternalEntityRefHandler, we believe that means that
individual applications are using expat unsafely, so there should be
separate CVEs for the applications, not expat.

CVE-2013-0340 - expat internal entity expansion
-----------------------------------------------

This probably qualifies for a CVE, but note that the issue came up in
CVE-2009-1955 (expat as used in Apache APR-util).  The implemented
solution was to change the application, not expat. See

<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=781403>
<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/apr/apr/trunk/xml/apr_xml.c?r1=757729&r2=781403&pathrev=781403&diff_format=h>

Apparently, if an application wishes to address this issue, it has to
call the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function with the name of an
alternative function that can handle entities more safely. The
opportunity to write your own code to process entities is probably
outside the general intention of our "the library provides an API
mechanism through which safe operation can be achieved" condition as
presented in the <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/21/24>
post.

CVE-2013-0339 - libxml2 external entities expansion
---------------------------------------------------

This also probably qualifies for a CVE. This may be another situation
where the library provides the opportunity to write your own code to
process entities safely. The libxml2 documentation for
xmlSAX2ResolveEntity says "The entity loader, to control the loading
of external entities, the application can either: ... override this
xmlSAX2ResolveEntity() callback in the SAX block ... or better use the
xmlSetExternalEntityLoader() function to set up it's own entity
resolution routine." If so, then like CVE-2013-0340, it again would
arguably be outside the bounds of the "the library provides an API
mechanism through which safe operation can be achieved" condition.

# USN-1904-2: libxml2 regression

17 July 2013

USN-1904-1 introduced a regression in libxml2.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [libxml2](/security/cves?package=libxml2) - GNOME XML library

## Details

USN-1904-1 fixed vulnerabilities in libxml2. The update caused a regression

for certain users. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that libxml2 would load XML external entities by default.

If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted

document, an attacker could possibly obtain access to arbitrary files or

cause resource consumption. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2013-0339](/security/CVE-2013-0339))

It was discovered that libxml2 incorrectly handled documents that end

abruptly. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted document, an attacker could possibly cause libxml2 to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-2877](/security/CVE-2013-2877))

### Reduce your security exposure

Package        : libxml2
Vulnerability  : external entity expansion
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-0338 CVE-2013-0339
Debian Bug     : 702260

Brad Hill of iSEC Partners discovered that many XML implementations are
vulnerable to external entity expansion issues, which can be used for
various purposes such as firewall circumvention, disguising an IP
address, and denial-of-service.  libxml2 was susceptible to these
problems when performing string substitution during entity expansion.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.8.dfsg-2+squeeze7.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, these problems
have been fixed in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=915149#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-02-25 05:25:38 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2, a library providing support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files, performed string substitutions when entity values for external  entity references replacement (--noent option) was requested / enabled during the XML file parsing. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file containing an external entity expansion, when processed would lead to excessive CPU consumption (denial of service).  This a different flaw from [CVE-2013-0338](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0338).  Upstream patch:  <http://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=23f05e0c33987d6605387b300c4be5da2120a7ab>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=915149#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-02-25 05:27:07 UTC  ``` Reference:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q1/391>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=915149#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-02-27 04:45:57 UTC  ``` Apart from causing DoS, External Entity Expansion could be abused in several other ways, which include:  - An attacker can circumvent firewalls and gain access to restricted resources as all the requests are made from an internal and trustworthy IP address, not from the outside.  - An attacker can abuse a service to attack, spy on or DoS your servers but also third party services. The attack is disguised with the IP address of the server and the attacker is able to utilize the high bandwidth of a big machine.  More details and write-up available at: <http://blog.python.org/2013/02/announcing-defusedxml-fixes-for-xml.html>  This flaw can be mitigated by not expanding external entities, specially the ones which come from untrusted sources.  libxml2 already provides mechanisms to disable external entities which applications can use.  Closing this flaw as "wontfix"   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=915149#c7)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-02-05 07:23:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been marked as WONTFIX for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  External Entity Expansion is the default behaviour of libxml2. Applications using libxml2 have an option of turning it off via an API, before parsing an xml file. While external entity expansion is dangerous when parsing untrusted xml files, it is an often required feature of certain applications like docbook, which only parse trusted xml files. For this reason we have decided to keep it on by default and encourage application developers to turn it off, when required.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=915149#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-13 19:59:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=915149#c7)) > External Entity Expansion is the default behaviour of libxml2. Applications > using libxml2 have an option of turning it off via an API, before parsing an > xml file.  The above information is not correct.  The default behavior of libxml2 is to not expand entity references, whether they are internal or external.  Applications using libxml2 can enable entity expansion by setting the XML_PARSE_NOENT parser option.  That option enables processing of both internal and external entities.  This is not recommended when processing untrusted XML input.  Note that the exact scope of this CVE is currently unclear as discussed in further details in the following oss-security mailing list post:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q2/245>  Its description suggests the CVE was created because of lack of easy way for applications to prevent external entity expansion.  However, as noted above, the default behavior is to not expand entities.  The CVE also references this libxml2 upstream commit:  <https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=4629ee02ac649c27f9c0cf98ba017c6b5526070f>  That commit addressed a bug in the way libxml2 handled external entities.  Even when entity expansion was disabled, libml2 was still fetching external entities.  This still made it vulnerable to certain XML eXternal Entity (XXE) issues such as DoS attacks or firewall circumvention, but would not allow easy information leak.  The above fix was applied to libxml2 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2012:1288:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1288.html>  Note that the libxml2 packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 released via the same erratum did not get the same fix.  The above commit only resolved the issue for general entities.  Similar problem was found to affect processing of parameter entities and got the [CVE-2014-0191](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0191) assigned, see [bug 1090976](show_bug.cgi?id=1090976 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0191 libxml2: external parameter entity loaded when entity substitution is disabled").   ``` |  |

```

This then breaks applications that need XXE to work, like docbook. We
can't disable every potential dangerous feature across the board, some
applications actually need these to work.

Subject: CVE Guidance for Libraries and Resource-Consumption DoS

(tl;dr - sorry, no such luck.  There's too much to consider.)

The recent discussions about XXE and related issues have touched upon
a number of issues that must be considered for CVE assignment.

INCLUSION (deciding whether to assign a CVE or not):

* Whether an "insecure default configuration" in a library should
   receive a CVE.

* How to draw the line between a "resource-consumption DoS" and
   acceptable, "normal" program behavior that just happens to be
   computationally intensive.

ABSTRACTION (deciding how many CVEs to assign):

* Whether a single CVE is assigned to a security concern in a library,
   or whether the applications using the library should receive their
   own CVEs.

* When multiple issues are "new types" of vulnerabilities (or not
   well-understood types), it can be difficult to consistently decide
   when to SPLIT or MERGE.  Such "new types" often spawn variants or
   are described poorly, so it can take some time before understanding
   and terminology stabilizes.

* While DoS issues have been around for ages, their underlying root
   causes have not been studied as closely as issues like buffer
   overflows, so it can be difficult to consistently classify different
   DoS issues as different types.

UTILITY:

* When clarifying CVE content decisions, we often have to consider how
   useful they may be to the CVE-using public; how practical they will
   be to implement without extensive, labor-intensive analysis or
   expertise; how much they capture the "spirit" of past content
   decisions; and whether we believe they could cause practical
   problems in the future without sufficient benefit (the so-called
   "snowball effect" I've touched on before).

* Because CVE is used so widely by many communities, we have sometimes
   had to accept improperly-applied content decisions instead of
   REJECTing the CVEs outright.  We do not view such issues as
   establishing a precedent.  A good example of this is CVE-2012-0217
   (the Intel SYSRET issue), in which many different operating systems
   should have received different CVEs, but the community's over-use of
   this CVE would have caused many more problems if we had REJECTed it
   and split it into many different CVEs.  (I know this example may be
   controversial to some, but the CVE assignment team is unified that
   this CVE should have been split.)  This type of situation may occur
   again, so - assignment of past CVEs does not imply a blind
   commitment to be consistent in the future just because there is a
   precedent.

Note that, when encountering a "novel" situation - or, at least, a
situation that is rarely encountered - I will sometimes take a "wait
and see" approach by doing things one way, and then (later) changing
directions.  While this is not ideal and can be frustrating to some
people, the fact is that we have to assign CVE identifiers to
real-world issues now, and the decisions that work for the short term
might not necessarily be ideal in the long run.  In some cases, the
entire community might not understand the issues well enough.  Of
course, we always try to be right the first time, or at least after a
couple examples have come up that raise awareness of the broader
context.

As a side note - I believe that the increase in chained exploits and
overall complexity will pose additional challenges for vulnerability
classification, vuln tracking, and vuln databases in the future.  As
vulnerabilities become more complex, we are likely to revisit some of
these content decisions.

CVE's "Traditional" Approach for Libraries
------------------------------------------

In general, when an issue appears to occur in a library, we determine
whether an application developer can use the library safely, or
whether there is no way to use it safely.  If the library can't be
used safely at all - then we would regard that as an issue in the
library.  We would assign a single CVE to that library, and we don't
assign any new CVEs to applications that use the vulnerable library.

If the developer has an opportunity to use the library correctly, but
doesn't, then we treat this as a vulnerability in the application.

Two classic examples of "library" problems are the C strcpy() function
and the PHP include() function.  Both of these functions have been
responsible for hundreds or thousands of vulnerabilities in
applications, but they can both be used safely if the programmer calls
them properly (perhaps after some input validation or equivalent
protection mechanism).  Accordingly, we don't have just one CVE for
strcpy() and one CVE for include() - we have hundreds of CVEs for the
applications that happen to use these functions insecurely.

With some libraries, however, the developer might not be able to have
the same high degree of control in avoiding a vulnerability; more
details later in this document.

The boundaries between library and application responsibility can
sometimes be blurred.  For example, we have created some CVEs for
buffer overflows or similar errors in PHP API functions where the
programmer would almost never be expected to call the function with
untrusted input.

Libraries are "special" because they can be used by many different
applications, in many different ways, and this can further complicate
decisions.  For example, a "secure fix" for one appliction developer
could harm usability for a different developer.  The perils of
preserving a bad API are equalled only by the perils of changing an
established API.

Note that I'm personally very interested in issues of API design, and
how API design choices can make it easier for application developers
to introduce vulnerabilities, but from a CVE perspective, these
interests are mostly irrelevant.  In general, we want CVE to only
cover specific, "actionable" problems instead of general warnings
about secure coding.

XXE etc. - Clarification on Vulnerability Types
-----------------------------------------------

I'm going to address the easier issues first.  Namely:

* We regard (1) entity expansion (aka billion-laughs or XEE) and (2)
   external entity references to remote http://, file://, or other URLs
   (aka XXE) to be distinct vulnerability types, and thus worth a
   SPLIT.

* Some of the recent disclosures cover additional issues that might be
   regarded as different types besides XXE/XXE (DTD retrieval, xpath
   support, xslt support, xinclude support).  These will need to be
   investigated in more detail before CVE assignments can be completed.

* In some cases, where there are two types of DoS, they MIGHT be worth
   a SPLIT.  There are clear cases like a NULL pointer dereference
   crash versus a reachable assertion or divide by zero.  Areas of
   algorithmic complexity, however, are not as well explored.  This is
   sometimes a judgment call, which can introduce variation in how
   pepole decide whether to split or merge.  An issue like an infinite
   loop (CPU and maybe memory consumption) might be different than
   another issue like uncontrolled memory allocation (just memory
   consumption, although the CPU and disk might get pretty busy too).
   In scenarios such as this, one general guideline is to consider
   whether the apparent fix for one issue will necessarily fix the
   other issue.  If you have infinite recursion, then fixing it by
   limiting the recursion depth would not do anything against an
   uncontrolled memory allocation, so this would probably be worth a
   SPLIT.

* Kurt - in <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/20/10>
   you referred to "linear expansion."  If you mean the "quadratic
   blowup entity expansion" as documented on
   <http://blog.python.org/2013/02/announcing-defusedxml-fixes-for-xml.html>,
   we are not sure whether this could be treated as different than
   billion laughs.  It's very likely that an implementation may fix
   billion-laughs in a way that does not also fix "quadratic blowup"
   issues; as the blog points out, this attack can "avoid triggering
   countermeasures of parsers against heavily nested entities."  So, we
   are likely to see fixes for one variant, then a new software package
   will get hit with the other variant - at best, this might mean an
   incomplete fix (becuase of different affected versions, a SPLIT
   would be clear in such a scenario).

   But, the quadratic blowup represents larger questions about when we
   decide that algorithmic complexity is just normal behavior versus a
   vulnerability.

Clarification on Resource-Consumption DoS
-----------------------------------------

When does an application cross the line from being "easily exploited"
to "just going slowly because it's been given so much data"?  This is
a CVE inclusion question, and there are no clear answers when it comes
to resource consumption.  We are almost certain to include an issue as
a DoS when any of the following hold:

   (1) there is a worst-case complexity that's "really bad" compared to
   the average case (or at least, common usage)

   (2) the amount of effort required by the attacker is much less than
   the amount of effort for the affected program (e.g., ZIP bombs or
   Smurf/packet-storm attacks)

   (3) un-released resource issues (like memory leaks or
   file-descriptor exhaustion) where the attacker can realistically
   increase the overall resources of the program incrementally, such as
   consuming only a small amount of memory for each "session"

   (4) the attacker can exceed a resource-consumption "policy" that the
   software attempts to explicitly enforce (this includes bypassing
   quotas, or if the application doesn't correctly implement an
   administrator-specified configuration)

Protection Mechanisms and "Default Configurations" in Libraries
---------------------------------------------------------------

The following guidance generally applies to the responsibilities of
libraries versus applications in avoiding vulnerabilities, but we pay
special attention to resource consumption issues, since that's the
topic of the day.

* If the issue is an insecure "default configuration" in a library,
   please consult the MITRE CNA first.  We do not yet have clear
   guidelines about whether to assign CVE identifiers.  There are still
   too many considerations.

   There are definitely some benefits to some users, especially
   software integrators, for assigning CVEs.  However, there are also
   some complications; for example, some XML libraries have a safer
   mode that must be set at compile time.  On platforms that have the
   "shared libraries" and "packages" concepts, this is problematic
   because XML-application-package-A has no way to force a situation in
   which XML-library-package-B is recompiled.  It could instead inline
   the third-party library code, but that has risks of its own.
   Sometimes the documentation suggests a source-code fix and there is
   no compilation option.  Certainly it's too burdensome for the
   application code to examine the library code at run time to try to
   figure out what compilation options were used.  In cases like this,
   where there is little recourse to the application developer to
   diagnose and fix the issue, we are likely to assign a CVE.

   Even if the XML library is configurable at run time, platforms with
   packages won't necessarily be able to handle this well.  You can't
   have N applications that want to have independent control of the
   configuration file of one library.  Finally, applications typically
   have to work with multiple versions of a library, especially
   multiple popular versions, so it might be reasonable to ask an
   application to take on some responsibility.

   So for now, we will treat these on a case-by-case basis.

   Some possibly-related precedents are: CVE-2010-4173 (requiring
   system-wide configuration, although it apparently is effectively for
   use by a single user); CVE-2010-2085 and CVE-2010-1459 (which are
   effectively for a framework, not a library, but we don't have
   application-specified CVEs; and CVE-2005-1992 (which is a "defualt
   configuration" in a programming language library).

   For now, if there is a "default configuration" or
   compiler-configured security setting in a library, please consult
   the MITRE CNA.

* If a library DOES NOT have a built-in mechanism for input that can
   reasonably be expected to be untrusted, then it can be generically
   abused and the programmer has no easy way of working around it.  So,
   the library should get a single CVE.  For example, an XML library
   should be expected to operate on an untrusted XML file.  By
   contrast, the glibc malloc implementation can't be considered
   responsible for detecting abusive arguments (allocation of 4+
   gigabytes of memory may be perfectly legitimate in some cases.)

* If a library DOES have a mechanism or "policy" for limiting resource
   consumption or other vulnerable conditions, then it does not get a
   CVE (although a bypass of such a mechanism still qualifies.)  When a
   protection mechanism is available, responsibility shifts to
   applications.

   An application should receive a CVE if all of the following hold:

   (A) the library provides an API mechanism through which safe
       operation can be achieved,

   (B) the application does not use that mechanism for safe operation,
       and

   (C) the application does not use any other mechanism for safe
       operation (e.g., resource-limited child processes).

   Any application that uses the library without (1) using its
   resource-consumption limits or (2) otherwise implementing its own
   protection mechanisms (such as spawning child processes with memory
   limits), should get a CVE.  This second item is important - we
   shouldn't "blame" an application just because it uses its own
   protection mechanism instead of the library's mechanism.

   We know this means that a large number of applications can be
   "blamed" and will receive a CVE.  But, no library can be reasonably
   expected to make universal decisions on resource limits for ALL of
   its potential users - that would hurt usability.

We hope that this post is helpful and informative in explaining how we
interpret CVE's content decisions as the vulnerability information
landscape continues to evolve.

```

It's still unclear to me what exactly CVE-2013-0339 covers.

Patch for the entity expansion DoS:
<https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=23f05e0c33987d6605387b300c4be5da2120a7ab>

Patch for not expanding external entities by default:
<https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=4629ee02ac649c27f9c0cf98ba017c6b5526070f>

Are both patches covered? The second one is quite important as it kills
the classic XXE vector <!ENTITY foo SYSTEM "/etc/passwd">

For Ubuntu, CVE-2013-0339 covers the XXE attack.
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libxml2/%2Bbug/1194410>

For Debian, it's "large memory consumption" only:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=702260>

For RedHat, it covers both but "libxml2 already provides mechanisms to
disable external entities which applications can use. Closing this flaw
as 'wontfix'": <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=915149>

And the official page for the CVE isn't helpful:
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0339>

Regards,
Nicolas Grégoire

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi, not sure if I even need this libxml2 as I don't write code or publish websites, as I think this may be what it's for?

I do however have this error and totally do not know what to do with the file I just downloaded.

I'm just a happy Ubuntu user :)

Any help would be gratefully acccepted!!

Thanks

Andrew

# USN-1904-1: libxml2 vulnerabilities

15 July 2013

Several security issues were fixed in libxml2.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [libxml2](/security/cves?package=libxml2) - GNOME XML library

## Details

It was discovered that libxml2 would load XML external entities by default.

If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted

document, an attacker could possibly obtain access to arbitrary files or

cause resource consumption. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2013-0339](/security/CVE-2013-0339))

It was discovered that libxml2 incorrectly handled documents that end

abruptly. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted document, an attacker could possibly cause libxml2 to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-2877](/security/CVE-2013-2877))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [libxml2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libxml2)
  -
  [2.9.0+dfsg1-4ubuntu4.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libxml2/2.9.0%2Bdfsg1-4ubuntu4.2)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [libxml2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libxml2)
  -
  [2.8.0+dfsg1-5ubuntu2.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libxml2/2.8.0%2Bdfsg1-5ubuntu2.3)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libxml2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libxml2)
  -
  [2.7.8.dfsg-5.1ubuntu4.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libxml2/2.7.8.dfsg-5.1ubuntu4.5)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libxml2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libxml2)
  -
  [2.7.6.dfsg-1ubuntu1.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libxml2/2.7.6.dfsg-1ubuntu1.9)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all

the necessary changes.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
