{
  "CVE-2013-0793": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the JavaScript history functions. A malicious site could cause a web page to be displayed that has a baseURI pointing to a different site, allowing cross-site scripting (XSS) and phishing attacks.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect handling of JavaScript history functions, leading to a mismatch between the displayed URL and the actual page's baseURI.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Phishing"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts or trick users into believing they are on a legitimate site when they are not, leading to cross-site scripting attacks or phishing attacks to steal data.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious site exploits a flaw in how Firefox handles JavaScript history functions, specifically by timing history navigations and manipulating the baseURI of the loaded page.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to host a malicious website and trick users into navigating it using specific JavaScript timing manipulation via the history object.  No special permissions needed other than having a user browse the malicious site."
