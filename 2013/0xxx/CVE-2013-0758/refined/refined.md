Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0758:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2013-0758 and provides details about the vulnerability. Therefore, the content is relevant.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the inconsistent handling of base URIs when loading resources within plugin objects embedded in SVG elements. Specifically:

*   `nsPluginHost::DoURLLoadSecurityCheck` resolves URLs using the document's base URI.
*  `nsPluginInstanceOwner::GetURL` uses `nsIContent::GetBaseURI`, which can resolve relative paths against a chrome URI due to the use of SVG's "use" element.

This discrepancy results in a security check bypass where a chrome-privileged page can be loaded, which would normally be blocked by the security manager.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) bypass:**  The vulnerability allows a bypass of COW, enabling access to privileged chrome functions.
*   **Inconsistent Base URI resolution:** The different methods used for base URI resolution in the plugin loading process create an exploitable inconsistency
* **Privilege Escalation:** Through the COW bypass, content can load chrome-privileged pages.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:**  Exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application (Firefox, Thunderbird, etc.).
* **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain escalated privileges by loading chrome-privileged pages.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Websites:** An attacker can host a malicious website containing a specially crafted SVG element that exploits the vulnerability. The vulnerable browser will load this page and trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Email/RSS (Limited):** While generally not exploitable directly via email in Thunderbird/SeaMonkey due to disabled scripting, the vulnerability might be leveraged in browser-like contexts within these applications, such as when viewing remote content in an RSS feed.
*   **Plugin Objects:** The exploit requires using a plugin object within the crafted SVG "use" element.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page to the victim or trick the victim into opening a specially crafted resource.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand the inconsistent base URI resolution and how to exploit it.
*   **Control over SVG content:** The attacker needs to be able to control the content of the SVG "use" element including plugin object instantiations.

**Additional Information from the Content (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Mariusz Mlynski.
*   The exploit involves using a plugin instance cloned into anonymous content of the SVG "use" element
*   The issue was addressed by unifying base URI usage within the plugin loading code, specifically by having `nsPluginInstanceOwner::GetURL()` use `nsIContent::GetBaseURI()` consistently.
*   Patches were created and applied across various Firefox versions (including ESR releases).
*   Red Hat provided security updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and 6 to address this issue in Firefox and Thunderbird.
*   Ubuntu also issued a security notice (USN-1681-1 and USN-1681-2) with patches for Firefox and Thunderbird to address this vulnerability.
*   openSUSE issued SUSE-SU-2013:0048-1, openSUSE-SU-2013:0049-1, and openSUSE-SU-2013:0131-1 security updates to patch the vulnerability in their respective products.
