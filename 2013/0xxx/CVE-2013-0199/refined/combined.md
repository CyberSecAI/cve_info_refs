The FreeIPA team is proud to announce version FreeIPA v3.1.2

This release contains Security Updates

It can be downloaded from <http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads>.

# Highlights[#](#highlights "Link to this heading")

During the past few months a number of security Issues have been found
that affect FreeIPA.

Three Security Advisories have been released:

* <CVE-2012-4546>: Incorrect CRLs publishing
* <CVE-2012-5484>: MITM Attack during Join process
* <CVE-2013-0199>: Cross-Realm Trust key leak

The FreeIPA Team would like to thank the Red Hat Security Response Team
and in particular Vincent Danen for the invaluable assistance provided
for the assessment and resolution of these issues. For CVE-2012-5484 we
would like to thank Petr Menšík for reporting the issue.

# Upgrading[#](#upgrading "Link to this heading")

Please consult each CVE announcement for related Upgrading instructions.

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note, that the referential integrity extension requires an
extended set of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server
with a excessive number of hosts, SUDO or HBAC entries may require
several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 is supported. Upgrading from previous versions is
not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys. Feedback

Please provide comments, bugs and other feedback via the freeipa-devel
mailing list: <http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/freeipa-devel>

# CVE-2013-0199[#](#cve-2013-0199 "Link to this heading")

## CVE-2013-0199: Cross-Realm Trust key leak[#](#cve-2013-0199-cross-realm-trust-key-leak "Link to this heading")

FreeIPA 3.0 introduced a Cross-Realm Kerberos trusts with Active
Directory, a feature that allows IPA administrators to create a Kerberos
trust with an AD. This allows IPA users to be able to access resources
in AD trusted domains and vice versa.

When the Kerberos trust is created, an outgoing and incoming keys are
stored in the IPA LDAP backend (in ipaNTTrustAuthIncoming and
ipaNTTrustAuthOutgoing attributes). However, the IPA LDAP ACIs allow
anonymous read acess to these attributes which could allow an
unprivileged user to read the keys. With these keys an attacker could
impersonate users and services of the opposite domain by crafting
special Kerberos tickets.

## Affected Versions[#](#affected-versions "Link to this heading")

All 3.x versions.

The vulnerability is present only if AD Trusts are enabled and a trust
relationship is in place.

## Impact[#](#impact "Link to this heading")

Medium

## Acknowledgements[#](#acknowledgements "Link to this heading")

The bug was found by the FreeIPA team during an internal review.

## Upgrade Instructions[#](#upgrade-instructions "Link to this heading")

Administrators are advise to change their ACIs to block the
ipaNTTrustAuthIncoming and ipaNTTrustAuthOutgoing attributes from access
from non administrative users.

Once the new ACIs are in place it is recommended to change the trust
password. This can be accomplished by temporary deleting and then
recreating the trust agreement between the two domains using tha ipa
trust CLI commands.

## Patches[#](#patches "Link to this heading")

A patch to resolve this issue is available through our git repository:
<http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/freeipa.git/commit/?id=d5966bde802d8ef84c202a3e7c85f17b9e305a30>

Applying the patch prevents further access to keys but does NOT change
the trust secret.
