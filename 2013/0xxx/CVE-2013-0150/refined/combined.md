How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [Code Execution via F5 Networks Java Appplet](https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/07/code-execution-via-f5-networks-java-applet/ "Permalink to Code Execution via F5 Networks JavaÂ Appplet")

Category: [Vulnerability Writeups](https://nealpoole.com/blog/category/vulnerability-writeups/) /
Tag: [java](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/java/), [java applet](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/java-applet/), [Oracle](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/oracle/), [security](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/security/), [f5](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/f5/), [code execution](https://nealpoole.com/blog/tag/code-execution/) / [Add Comment](#respond)

### Summary

A signed Java applet distributed with a number of products
by [F5 Networks](http://www.f5.com/) contained a vulnerability which allowed
for arbitrary code execution on a local machine under specific circumstances.

The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2013-0150 and F5 has put
together its own [security advisory](http://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/14000/400/sol14468.html) which lists affected applications
and provides information on which versions contained patched applets.
In the future F5 will ask Oracle to blacklist the applets so that they
can not be used in a malicious attack.

### Applet Overview

The applet in question is intended to be used to download and execute
software from F5 on a user’s machine. The general workflow is as follows:

1. Applet downloads executable (provided as a parameter to the applet named `source`)
2. Applet verifies signature for executable (the signature is also provided as a parameter)
3. If the signature is valid, the executable is run by the applet.

The vulnerability that I discovered was not in the signature scheme; instead,
it involved a bug in how the applet saved the newly downloaded executable.

### Vulnerability Details

The applet allowed you to provide a local filename for the downloaded file via
a parameter named `filename`. The file was intended to be saved in the system
temporary directory (`%TEMP%`, `/tmp`, etc). However, the `filename` parameter
was vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. As a result, the file
saved anywhere on the filesystem and would overwrite existing file contents.

For an attack on Windows machines, I realized that the executable could be saved
in `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Programs\Startup`, which
would allow the application to be executed when the machine next booted up. The `%TEMP%`
directory by default is `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp`, so my malicious parameter
looked like `../../../Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/app.exe`.

The only interaction required by a user was to allow the signed Java applet to run.
That interaction might not even have been necessary if the user had chosen to trust
applets signed by F5 Networks in the past.

### Disclosure Timeline

* **April 26th, 2013, 5:40 PM**: Email from F5 asking about disclosure timeline and
  finding attribution details

  Oracle’s Java blacklist.

* **June 21st, 2013**: Followup from F5. Fixes continue to be developed and released.
* **July 2nd, 2013, 11:26 AM**: Followup from F5. Public announcement has been made.
* **July 2nd, 2013 6:30 PM**: Blog post published

### Conclusion

Signed Java applets are [still a source of major insecurity](https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/01/how-hard-is-it-to-blacklist-a-java-applet/)
beyond the many vulnerabilities discovered in the JVM itself. Developers
working with signed Java applets should be especially cautions

This vulnerability was reported to F5 Networks in accordance with
their policies on [reporting suspected vulnerabilities](http://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/4000/600/sol4602.html?sr=12234302). I want to thank
them for their thoroughness and commend them for their smooth disclosure
and remediation process.
