{
  "CVE-2013-0217": {
    "description": "The Xen netback implementation contains a memory leak on an error path which is guest triggerable.",
    "root_cause": "A memory leak occurs in the Xen netback driver when handling errors in the `xen_netbk_tx_check_gop` function, specifically when processing grant table copies (GOPs). If the initial GOP status check fails, the code releases the pending index and corresponding VIF but does not properly free the allocated pages associated with it.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest can trigger a memory leak in the backend domain, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by exhausting available memory.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious guest can send network packets with crafted grant table copies (GOPs) which will trigger the error condition in netback driver, resulting in a memory leak"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious guest with access to PV network devices is required to trigger this vulnerability.",
