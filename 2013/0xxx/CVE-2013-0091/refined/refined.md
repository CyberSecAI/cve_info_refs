CVE ID: CVE-2013-0091
Root cause of vulnerability: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the browser attempts to access a CElement object that has already been deleted from memory.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free, memory corruption
Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. With administrative privileges, an attacker could gain full control of the affected system, install programs, modify or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
Attack vectors: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer. They could also exploit compromised websites or those that accept user-provided content, embedding the malicious code. The attacker must convince the user to visit the malicious site, typically by enticing them to click a link in an email or instant message, or open a malicious attachment.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or inject malicious content into a website and convince a user to view it with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
