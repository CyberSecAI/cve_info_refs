  "CVE-2013-0131": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NVIDIA driver for the X Window System, when operated in \"NoScanout\" mode, does not properly validate the size of an ARGB cursor, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (e.g., X server segmentation fault) or arbitrary code execution. If the X server runs as setuid root, an attacker could potentially gain root privileges.",
      "Attack vectors": "An X client installs an ARGB cursor that is larger than the expected size (64x64 or 256x256, depending on the driver version). This requires a connection to a running X server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs a connection to a running X server and the ability to install an ARGB cursor. Normally, X servers only accept authenticated connections from the local host, but some may be configured to allow more permissive connections and/or network connections."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Buffer overflow in the NVIDIA UNIX GPU driver when handling ARGB cursors in \"NoScanout\" mode.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Potential denial of service (X server segmentation fault), or arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to privilege escalation to root if the X server runs as setuid root.",
      "Attack vectors": "An X client installs an ARGB cursor larger than the expected size, overflowing a buffer in the NVIDIA driver.",
          "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to connect to a running X server and be able to install ARGB cursors. X servers are often configured to only accept local connections, but this can be configured differently."
