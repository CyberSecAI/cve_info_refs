CVE-2013-0131: NVIDIA UNIX GPU Driver ARGB Cursor Buffer Overflow in "NoScanout" Mode.

When the NVIDIA driver for the X Window System is operated in "NoScanout" mode, and an X client installs an ARGB cursor that is larger than the expected size (64x64 or 256x256, depending on the driver version), the driver will overflow a buffer. This can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault), or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. Because the X server runs as setuid root in many configurations, an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability in those configurations to gain root privileges. To install an ARGB cursor, an application would require a connection to a running X server. Normally, X servers are configured to only accept authenticated connections from the local host, but some X servers may be configured to more permissively allow connections, and/or to allow connections over a network.

"NoScanout" mode is enabled implicitly on NVIDIA products which lack display output connectors, and can be enabled explicitly on some other configurations with the X configuration option:

Option "UseDisplayDevice" "none"

NVIDIA GPU drivers for OSes other than Linux, FreeBSD, VMware ESX, and Solaris are not affected.

This vulnerability has been present since NVIDIA driver version 195.22. The overflow is fixed in 304.88, 310.44, 313.30, and all drivers newer than those versions. NVIDIA recommends that users upgrade to a fixed driver version, or disable NoScanout mode, where possible.

This vulnerability was identified by NVIDIA. There are no known reports of exploits of this vulnerability in the wild.

Security issues pertaining to NVIDIA's UNIX GPU Drivers can be reported through unix-security@nvidia.com or the web form available from <http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-security.html>

## NVIDIA UNIX GPU driver ARGB cursor buffer overflow in "NoScanout" mode

#### Vulnerability Note VU#771620

Original Release Date: 2013-04-05 | Last Revised: 2013-04-05

---

### Overview

NVIDIA UNIX video drivers contain a buffer overflow vulnerability when run in NoScanout mode.

### Description

| The NVIDIA security advisory states:  *NVIDIA UNIX GPU Driver ARGB Cursor Buffer Overflow in "NoScanout" Mode.When the NVIDIA driver for the X Window System is operated in "NoScanout" mode, and an X client installs an ARGB cursor that is larger than the expected size (64x64 or 256x256, depending on the driver version), the driver will overflow a buffer. This can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault), or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. Because the X server runs as setuid root in many configurations, an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability in those configurations to gain root privileges.To install an ARGB cursor, an application would require a connection to a running X server. Normally, X servers are configured to only accept authenticated connections from the local host, but some X servers may be configured to more permissively allow connections, and/or to allow connections over a network."NoScanout" mode is enabled implicitly on NVIDIA products which lack display output connectors, and can be enabled explicitly on some other configurations with the X configuration option:Option "UseDisplayDevice" "none"NVIDIA GPU drivers for OSes other than Linux, FreeBSD, VMware ESX, and Solaris are not affected.This vulnerability has been present since NVIDIA driver version 195.22.* *The overflow is fixed in 304.88, 310.44, 313.30, and all drivers newer than those versions.**NVIDIA recommends that users upgrade to a fixed driver version, or disable NoScanout mode, where possible.This vulnerability was identified by NVIDIA. There are no known reports of exploits of this vulnerability in the wild.*Additional details may be found in the full [NVIDIA security advisory](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3290). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local authenticated attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to gain privilege escalation to the root user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**The overflow is fixed in driver versions 304.88, 310.44, 313.30, and all drivers newer than those versions. Users should [download the drivers directly from NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us). |

# NVIDIA Drivers: Privilege escalation — GLSA **201304-01**

Two vulnerabilities in NVIDIA drivers may allow a local attacker to
gain escalated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **304.88** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **304.88** |

### Background

The NVIDIA drivers provide X11 and GLX support for NVIDIA graphic
boards.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in NVIDIA drivers:

* A vulnerability has been found in the way NVIDIA drivers handle
  read/write access to GPU device nodes, allowing access to arbitrary
  system memory locations (CVE-2012-4225).
* A buffer overflow error has been discovered in NVIDIA drivers
  (CVE-2013-0131).

NOTE: Exposure to CVE-2012-4225 is reduced in Gentoo due to 660
permissions being used on the GPU device nodes by default.

### Impact

A local attacker could gain escalated privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NVIDIA driver users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-304.88"

```

| [Description](#c0)  Mark Piper    2004-02-25 23:16:17 UTC  ``` To use the Escreen feature of Eterm (Eterm -t Escreen), screen must be merged BEFORE emerging Eterm.  Otherwise, Eterm will exit immediately when started.  (Normal eterm, without screen functionality, will still work.)  Perhaps an escreen use var should be made, or just have screen become a dependency of eterm.  A similar problem may exist w/ Eterm's twin support, though I haven't checked.   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.  On a system where screen has never been merged, emerge x11-terms/eterm 2.  Emerge screen 3.  Run Eterm -t Escreen  Actual Results:   Watch it exit immediately :-) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-02-26 22:55:49 UTC  ``` fixed in cvs ... another local use flag, escreen, has been added ``` |  |
