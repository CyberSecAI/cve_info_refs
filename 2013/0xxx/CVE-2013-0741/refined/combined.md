# ImageGen

**2020 - ImageGen has been retired.**

*Use ImageGen for fast and easy resizing of photos, screenshots, and images from icon to thumbnail to full-screen retina sizes.*

*Do you need to create photo or lightbox galleries, screenshot flip books, staff profile or directory pages? Would you like to automatically create graphical text from any font on your server for headlines or menus? Do you need to protect your site’s images with a watermark?*

*ImageGen can create text graphics as well as overlay text on images. And ImageGen can automatically protect and brand your images with watermarks and corporate logos.*

*With more than 30 options, ImageGen can create hundreds of thousands of variations to meet virtually any need. ImageGen is easy to install and use on your website.
