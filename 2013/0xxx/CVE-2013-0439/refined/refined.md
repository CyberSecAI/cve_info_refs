Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-0439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from multiple security flaws in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which can be exploited to bypass security restrictions. The specific technical details for CVE-2013-0439 are not provided directly in the text, but it is listed as one of the many vulnerabilities addressed by updating the JRE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue lies in the ability of untrusted Java applets to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code due to vulnerabilities in how the JRE handles security checks and memory management. Specifically, this set of vulnerabilities allows an attacker to bypass the Security Manager.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This can lead to a full compromise of the system, with the attacker gaining control over the system. The vulnerability affects both Java applets run in browsers and standalone Java applications. Server deployments of Java are also affected if they process untrusted data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Browsers:** By enticing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document that contains a malicious Java applet or JNLP file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability. This includes "drive-by download" attacks on compromised websites.
*   **Applications using web content rendering components:** Applications using the Internet Explorer web content rendering components, such as Microsoft Office or Windows Desktop Search, can also be exploited by malicious Java applets embedded in web content.
*   **Server-side Java:** By causing a Java server application to process untrusted data, the vulnerabilities can be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious Java applets or JNLP files onto a website or other location accessible to the victim.
*   The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., visiting a compromised website or opening a malicious file).
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication or access to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The document indicates that at least one of these vulnerabilities is being actively exploited in the wild.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by updating to Java 7 Update 13 or Java 6 Update 39.
*   Disabling Java in web browsers is also recommended as a mitigation measure.
*   The provided CVSS vector for CVE-2013-0439 is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), which corresponds to a base score of 10.0 and indicates a highly critical vulnerability.
