## Description

The xen\_iret function in arch/x86/xen/xen-asm\_32.S in the Linux kernel before 3.7.9 on 32-bit Xen paravirt\_ops platforms does not properly handle an invalid value in the DS segment register, which allows guest OS users to gain guest OS privileges via a crafted application.

# USN-1796-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

8 April 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Andrew Jones discovered a flaw with the xen\_iret function in Linux kernel's

Xen virtualizeation. In the 32-bit Xen paravirt platform an unprivileged

guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash

the system) or gain guest OS privilege. ([CVE-2013-0228](/security/CVE-2013-0228))

Emese Revfy discovered that in the Linux kernel signal handlers could leak

address information across an exec, making it possible to by pass ASLR

(Address Space Layout Randomization). A local user could use this flaw to

by pass ASLR to reliably deliver an exploit payload that would otherwise be

stopped (by ASLR). ([CVE-2013-0914](/security/CVE-2013-0914))

A memory use after free error was discover in the Linux kernel's tmpfs

filesystem. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-1767](/security/CVE-2013-1767))

Mateusz Guzik discovered a race in the Linux kernel's keyring. A local user

could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2013-1792](/security/CVE-2013-1792))

Mathias Krause discovered a memory leak in the Linux kernel's crypto report

API. A local user with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN could exploit this leak to examine

some of the kernel's stack memory. ([CVE-2013-2546](/security/CVE-2013-2546))

Mathias Krause discovered a memory leak in the Linux kernel's crypto report

API. A local user with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN could exploit this leak to examine

some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2013-2547](/security/CVE-2013-2547))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel's crypto

algorithm report API. A local user could exploit these flaws to leak kernel

stack and heap memory contents. ([CVE-2013-2548](/security/CVE-2013-2548))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-27-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-27.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-27.46)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-27-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-27.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-27.46)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-27-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-27.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-27.46)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-27-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-27.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-27.46)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-27-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-27.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-27.46)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's

getsockname implementation for Logical Link Layer (llc) sockets. A local

user could exploit this flaw to examine some of the kernel's stack memory.

([CVE-2012-6542](/security/CVE-2012-6542))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth

Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) implementation. A

local user could exploit these flaws to examine some of the kernel's stack

memory. ([CVE-2012-6544](/security/CVE-2012-6544))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth

RFCOMM protocol implementation. A local user could exploit these flaws to

examine parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6545](/security/CVE-2012-6545))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel's

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking stack. A local user could

exploit these flaws to examine some parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6546](/security/CVE-2012-6546))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's UDF

file system implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine

some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6548](/security/CVE-2012-6548))

Andrew Jones discovered a flaw with the xen\_iret function in Linux kernel's

Xen virtualizeation. In the 32-bit Xen paravirt platform an unprivileged

guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash

the system) or gain guest OS privilege. ([CVE-2013-0228](/security/CVE-2013-0228))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack

when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local

unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from

the kernel. ([CVE-2013-0349](/security/CVE-2013-0349))

A flaw was discovered in the Edgeort USB serial converter driver when the

device is disconnected while it is in use. A local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-1774](/security/CVE-2013-1774))

Andrew Honig discovered a flaw in guest OS time updates in the Linux

kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash host system) or

potential escalate privilege to the host kernel level. ([CVE-2013-1796](/security/CVE-2013-1796))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-351-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-351.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-351.64)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

Petr says: "
 I've analysed the bug and I think that xen_iret() cannot cope with
 mangled DS, in this case zeroed out (null selector/descriptor) by either
 xen_failsafe_callback() or RESTORE_REGS because the corresponding LDT
 entry was invalidated by the reproducer. "

Jan took a look at the preliminary patch and came up a fix that solves
this problem:

"This code gets called after all registers other than those handled by
IRET got already restored, hence a null selector in %ds or a non-null
one that got loaded from a code or read-only data descriptor would
cause a kernel mode fault (with the potential of crashing the kernel
as a whole, if panic_on_oops is set)."

The way to fix this is to realize that the we can only relay on the
registers that IRET restores. The two that are guaranteed are the
%cs and %ss as they are always fixed GDT selectors. Also they are
inaccessible from user mode - so they cannot be altered. This is
the approach taken in this patch.

Another alternative option suggested by Jan would be to relay on
the subtle realization that using the %ebp or %esp relative references uses
the %ss segment.  In which case we could switch from using %eax to %ebp and
would not need the %ss over-rides. That would also require one extra
instruction to compensate for the one place where the register is used
as scaled index. However Andrew pointed out that is too subtle and if
further work was to be done in this code-path it could escape folks attention
and lead to accidents.

## Description

The xen\_failsafe\_callback function in Xen for the Linux kernel 2.6.23 and other versions, when running a 32-bit PVOPS guest, allows local users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) by triggering an iret fault, leading to use of an incorrect stack pointer and stack corruption.

efi: Clear EFI\_RUNTIME\_SERVICES rather than EFI\_BOOT by "noefi" boot parameter
commit 1de63d60cd5b0d33a812efa455d5933bf1564a51 upstream.
There was a serious problem in samsung-laptop that its platform driver is
designed to run under BIOS and running under EFI can cause the machine to
become bricked or can cause Machine Check Exceptions.
Discussion about this problem:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cdimage/+bug/1040557
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=47121
The patches to fix this problem:
efi: Make 'efi\_enabled' a function to query EFI facilities

samsung-laptop: Disable on EFI hardware
e0094244e41c4d0c7ad69920681972fc45d8ce34
Unfortunately this problem comes back again if users specify "noefi" option.
This parameter clears EFI\_BOOT and that driver continues to run even if running
under EFI. Refer to the document, this parameter should clear
EFI\_RUNTIME\_SERVICES instead.

PCI/PM: Clean up PME state when removing a device
commit 249bfb83cf8ba658955f0245ac3981d941f746ee upstream.
Devices are added to pci\_pme\_list when drivers use pci\_enable\_wake()
or pci\_wake\_from\_d3(), but they aren't removed from the list unless
the driver explicitly disables wakeup. Many drivers never disable
wakeup, so their devices remain on the list even after they are
removed, e.g., via hotplug. A subsequent PME poll will oops when
it tries to touch the device.
This patch disables PME# on a device before removing it, which removes
the device from pci\_pme\_list. This is safe even if the device never
had PME# enabled.
This oops can be triggered by unplugging a Thunderbolt ethernet adapter
on a Macbook Pro, as reported by Daniel below.

Jan took a look at the preliminary patch and came up a fix that solves
this problem:
"This code gets called after all registers other than those handled by
IRET got already restored, hence a null selector in %ds or a non-null
one that got loaded from a code or read-only data descriptor would
cause a kernel mode fault (with the potential of crashing the kernel
as a whole, if panic\_on\_oops is set)."
The way to fix this is to realize that the we can only relay on the
registers that IRET restores. The two that are guaranteed are the
%cs and %ss as they are always fixed GDT selectors. Also they are
inaccessible from user mode - so they cannot be altered. This is
the approach taken in this patch.
Another alternative option suggested by Jan would be to relay on
the subtle realization that using the %ebp or %esp relative references uses
the %ss segment. In which case we could switch from using %eax to %ebp and
would not need the %ss over-rides. That would also require one extra
instruction to compensate for the one place where the register is used
as scaled index. However Andrew pointed out that is too subtle and if
further work was to be done in this code-path it could escape folks attention
and lead to accidents.

x86/mm: Check if PUD is large when validating a kernel address
commit 0ee364eb316348ddf3e0dfcd986f5f13f528f821 upstream.
A user reported the following oops when a backup process reads
/proc/kcore:
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffbb00ff33b000
IP: [] kern\_addr\_valid+0xbe/0x110
[...]
Call Trace:
[] read\_kcore+0x17a/0x370
[] proc\_reg\_read+0x77/0xc0
[] vfs\_read+0xc7/0x130
[] sys\_read+0x53/0xa0
[] system\_call\_fastpath+0x16/0x1b
Investigation determined that the bug triggered when reading
system RAM at the 4G mark. On this system, that was the first
address using 1G pages for the virt->phys direct mapping so the
PUD is pointing to a physical address, not a PMD page.
The problem is that the page table walker in kern\_addr\_valid() is
not checking pud\_large() and treats the physical address as if
it was a PMD. If it happens to look like pmd\_none then it'll
silently fail, probably returning zeros instead of real data. If
the data happens to look like a present PMD though, it will be
walked resulting in the oops above.
This patch adds the necessary pud\_large() check.
Unfortunately the problem was not readily reproducible and now
they are running the backup program without accessing
/proc/kcore so the patch has not been validated but I think it
makes sense.

x86/apic: Work around boot failure on HP ProLiant DL980 G7 Server systems
commit cb214ede7657db458fd0b2a25ea0b28dbf900ebc upstream.
When a HP ProLiant DL980 G7 Server boots a regular kernel,
there will be intermittent lost interrupts which could
result in a hang or (in extreme cases) data loss.
The reason is that this system only supports x2apic physical
mode, while the kernel boots with a logical-cluster default
setting.
This bug can be worked around by specifying the "x2apic\_phys" or
"nox2apic" boot option, but we want to handle this system
without requiring manual workarounds.
The BIOS sets ACPI\_FADT\_APIC\_PHYSICAL in FADT table.
As all apicids are smaller than 255, BIOS need to pass the
control to the OS with xapic mode, according to x2apic-spec,
chapter 2.9.
Current code handle x2apic when BIOS pass with xapic mode
enabled:
When user specifies x2apic\_phys, or FADT indicates PHYSICAL:
1. During madt oem check, apic driver is set with xapic logical
or xapic phys driver at first.
2. enable\_IR\_x2apic() will enable x2apic\_mode.
3. if user specifies x2apic\_phys on the boot line, x2apic\_phys\_probe()
will install the correct x2apic phys driver and use x2apic phys mode.
Otherwise it will skip the driver will let x2apic\_cluster\_probe to
take over to install x2apic cluster driver (wrong one) even though FADT
indicates PHYSICAL, because x2apic\_phys\_probe does not check
FADT PHYSICAL.
Add checking x2apic\_fadt\_phys in x2apic\_phys\_probe() to fix the
problem.

x86: Do not leak kernel page mapping locations
commit e575a86fdc50d013bf3ad3aa81d9100e8e6cc60d upstream.
Without this patch, it is trivial to determine kernel page
mappings by examining the error code reported to dmesg[1].
Instead, declare the entire kernel memory space as a violation
of a present page.
Additionally, since show\_unhandled\_signals is enabled by
default, switch branch hinting to the more realistic
expectation, and unobfuscate the setting of the PF\_PROT bit to
improve readability.

s390/timer: avoid overflow when programming clock comparator
commit d911e03d097bdc01363df5d81c43f69432eb785c upstream.
Since ed4f209 "s390/time: fix sched\_clock() overflow" a new helper function
is used to avoid overflows when converting TOD format values to nanosecond
values.
The kvm interrupt code formerly however only worked by accident because of
an overflow. It tried to program a timer that would expire in more than ~29
years. Because of the old TOD-to-nanoseconds overflow bug the real expiry
value however was much smaller, but now it isn't anymore.
This however triggers yet another bug in the function that programs the clock
comparator s390\_next\_ktime(): if the absolute "expires" value is after 2042
this will result in an overflow and the programmed value is lower than the
current TOD value which immediatly triggers a clock comparator (= timer)
interrupt.
Since the timer isn't expired it will be programmed immediately again and so
on... the result is a dead system.
To fix this simply program the maximum possible value if an overflow is
detected.

mm: don't overwrite mm->def\_flags in do\_mlockall()

With commit 8e72033f2a48 ("thp: make MADV\_HUGEPAGE check for
mm->def\_flags") the VM\_NOHUGEPAGE flag may be set on s390 in
mm->def\_flags for certain processes, to prevent future thp mappings.
This would be overwritten by do\_mlockall(), which sets it back to 0 with
an optional VM\_LOCKED flag set.
To fix this, instead of overwriting mm->def\_flags in do\_mlockall(), only
the VM\_LOCKED flag should be set or cleared.

The bit that is being poked as "clockwatch" enable bit for the ST

clock divider on the ST variants, and setting it to 1 will affect
timekeeping in a very bad way.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-222-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-222.33](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-222.33)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-27-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-27.46~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-27.46~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's

getsockname implementation for Logical Link Layer (llc) sockets. A local

user could exploit this flaw to examine some of the kernel's stack memory.

([CVE-2012-6542](/security/CVE-2012-6542))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth

Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) implementation. A

local user could exploit these flaws to examine some of the kernel's stack

memory. ([CVE-2012-6544](/security/CVE-2012-6544))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth

RFCOMM protocol implementation. A local user could exploit these flaws to

examine parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6545](/security/CVE-2012-6545))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel's

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking stack. A local user could

exploit these flaws to examine some parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6546](/security/CVE-2012-6546))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's UDF

file system implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine

some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6548](/security/CVE-2012-6548))

Andrew Jones discovered a flaw with the xen\_iret function in Linux kernel's

Xen virtualizeation. In the 32-bit Xen paravirt platform an unprivileged

guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash

the system) or gain guest OS privilege. ([CVE-2013-0228](/security/CVE-2013-0228))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack

when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local

unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from

the kernel. ([CVE-2013-0349](/security/CVE-2013-0349))

A flaw was discovered in the Edgeort USB serial converter driver when the

device is disconnected while it is in use. A local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-1774](/security/CVE-2013-1774))

Andrew Honig discovered a flaw in guest OS time updates in the Linux

kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash host system) or

potential escalate privilege to the host kernel level. ([CVE-2013-1796](/security/CVE-2013-1796))

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 42 (CVE-2013-0228) - Linux kernel hits
 general protection if %ds is corrupt for 32-bit PVOPS.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-0228 / XSA-42
                            version 2

 Linux kernel hits general protection if %ds is corrupt for 32-bit PVOPS.

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Linux kernel when returning from an iret assumes that %ds segment is safe
and uses it to reference various per-cpu related fields. Unfortunately
the user can modify the LDT and provide a NULL one. Whenever an iret is called
we end up in xen_iret and try to use the %ds segment and cause an
general protection fault.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or buggy unprivileged user space can cause the guest kernel to
crash, or permit a privilege escalation within the guest, or operate
erroneously.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All 32bit PVOPS versions of Linux are affected, since the introduction
of Xen PVOPS support in 2.6.23.  Classic-Xen kernels are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

This can be mitigated by not running 32bit PVOPS Linux guests.

32bit classic-Xen guests, all 64bit PV guests and all HVM guests are
unaffected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
