- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue existed in the handling of emergency calls from the lock screen.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the logic of how emergency calls are handled when the device is locked.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A person with physical access to the device may be able to bypass the screen lock.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device is required. The attacker must then exploit the logic flaw in emergency call handling.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Physical access to the device.
