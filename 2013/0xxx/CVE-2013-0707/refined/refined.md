Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2013-0707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that there's a flaw in how the affected JustSystems products process certain files, which allows for arbitrary code execution. The provided links point to a Japanese-only advisory from the vendor, which may contain additional details.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core vulnerability is the potential for arbitrary code execution, which is a high-severity issue.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted file.
- The software fails to properly validate or sanitize the file data, allowing malicious code to be injected or executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
- This could lead to a complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is primarily through specially crafted files.
- An attacker needs to deliver a malicious file to the target user. This could be achieved by several ways including:
  - Email attachments
  - Malicious websites
  - File sharing platforms

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to create malicious files.
- They need to convince the user to open the malicious file. This could be accomplished through social engineering tactics.
- The attacker could be an external attacker who has no initial access to the target system.

**Additional details from JPCERT/CC:**
-   **Access Required:** Can be attacked over the Internet using packets (High severity). This suggests the vulnerability could be triggered remotely if the application processes files received over a network.
-   **Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability (High severity).
-   **User Interaction Required:** The user must open the malicious file (Medium severity).
-   **Exploit Complexity:** Some expertise and/or luck required (Medium-High severity), this means the exploit requires more technical skill.

This information indicates that CVE-2013-0707 is a serious vulnerability that could be exploited by remote attackers without authentication. The user interaction needed might be achieved through social engineering. It is very important for users of affected products to apply the available patches.
