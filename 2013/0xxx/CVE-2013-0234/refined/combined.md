# XSS in Elgg 1.8.12, 1.7.16 (core module "Twitter widget")

---

*From*: Moritz Naumann <security () moritz-naumann com>

*Date*: Tue, 29 Jan 2013 01:03:52 +0100

```
Hello dear XSS bored audience,

the PHP based social networking engine Elgg [1], versions 1.8.12 and
1.7.16 and earlier, bears a persistent script injection vulnerability in
its core module "Twitter widget", which allows for XSS attacks.

On installations which have the Twitter widget activated (disabled by
default, but in use on many installations), any authenticated user may
add the Twitter to their activity / dashboard page. Editing its
configuration allows the user to set the twitter_username parameter. The
value stored in this parameter will be echoed without sanitation [2]
when this page is viewed by any other user, authenticated or not.

For mitigation, the Twitter widget can be disabled by a site admin (in
the admin backend's plugin configuration area).

According to changes committed [3] to their Git repository Elgg
developers will provide a fix for this issue in the upcoming (?) 1.8.13
release.

This was originally reported by
     Moritz Naumann
     <http://moritz-naumann.com>
on January 17, to security[at]elgg.org, and got me a prompt vendor
reply. Coordination of advisory release is something to improve upon
next time.

A CVE ID has, to my knowledge, not yet been assigned. Secunia has
assigned it SA52007.

Have fun,

Moritz

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
