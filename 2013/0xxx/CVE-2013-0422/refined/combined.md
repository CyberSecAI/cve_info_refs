A malicious deployed application could use this flaw to circumvent the controls applied by the Java security manager. Affected JBoss middleware users are advised to use a patched or unaffected implementation of Java 7. JBoss middleware users who are not using Java 7 or are not relying on the Java security manager are not affected by this flaw.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c18)  David Jorm    2013-01-14 04:00:15 UTC  ``` Fixed in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 11. <https://blogs.oracle.com/security/entry/security_alert_for_cve_2013> <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u11-relnotes-1896856.html>  External Reference: <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2013-0422-1896849.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c22)  Tomas Hoger    2013-01-14 10:49:27 UTC  ``` Created java-1.7.0-openjdk tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 895035](show_bug.cgi?id=895035 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2013-0422 CVE-2012-3174 java-1.7.0-openjdk various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c23)  Tomas Hoger    2013-01-14 18:59:13 UTC  ``` Related commits in upstream OpenJDK7 repositories:  <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u-dev/jdk/rev/ecc14534318c> <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u-dev/jdk/rev/d9969a953f69>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c24)  Tomas Hoger    2013-01-14 19:24:30 UTC  ``` Esteban Guillardoy's (Immunity) analysis of the issues used by the published exploit to achieve code execution:  <https://partners.immunityinc.com/idocs/Java%20MBeanInstantiator.findClass%200day%20Analysis.pdf>  Adam Gowdiak's (Security Explorations) response to the above analysis, disagreeing with which issue is to be be called the core problem, and which is exploitation technique:  <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Jan/77>  Oracle fix addresses issue in the new reflection API and its MethodHandles.Lookup.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-14 20:54:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0156 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0156.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c26)  Tomas Hoger    2013-01-15 09:12:45 UTC  ``` IBM PSIRT blog post with a statement indicating that IBM JDK/JRE is not affected by this issue:  <https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/PSIRT/entry/oracle_java_7_security_manager_bypass_vulnerability_cve_2013_04224?lang=en_us>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c27)  Tomas Hoger    2013-01-15 12:34:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #24](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c24)) > Oracle fix addresses issue in the new reflection API and its > MethodHandles.Lookup.  Another follow up form Esteban Guillardoy (Immunity), pointing out that Oracle Java SE 7 Update 11 does not prevent sandboxed code form gaining reference to restricted classes using MBeanInstantiator.findClass:  <http://immunityproducts.blogspot.com/2013/01/confirmed-java-only-fixed-one-of-two.html>  This currently leads to a confusing CVE description:    <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0422>    Oracle Java 7 before Update 11 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary   code via unspecified vectors, as exploited in the wild in January 2013, as   demonstrated by Blackhole and Nuclear Pack, and a different vulnerability   than [CVE-2012-4681](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4681) and [CVE-2012-3174](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3174). NOTE: as of 20130114, the scope of this   CVE is not clear due to the lack of technical details from Oracle, the CNA.   It is currently unknown whether this CVE is related to (1) the findClass   method in the MBeanInstantiator class, (2) recursive use of the Reflection   API, (3) an unrelated vulnerability, or (4) a combination of two or more of   these vulnerabilities. NOTE: it was originally reported that Java 6 was also   vulnerable, but the reporter has retracted this claim, stating that Java 6   is not exploitable because the affected code is called differently.  The CVE is used for the combination of MBeanInstantiator and new reflection API issues to achieve code execution, even though only the reflection API issue was addressed in 7u11.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c29)  Tomas Hoger    2013-01-16 08:04:10 UTC  ``` Patches integrated in upstream IcedTea versions 2.1.4, 2.2.4 and 2.3.4:  <http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/distro-pkg-dev/2013-January/021413.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c30)  Tomas Hoger    2013-01-16 16:55:55 UTC  ``` As noted in [comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c10), public exploit did not achieve sandbox bypass with OpenJDK 7 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 because of the different behavior of the sun.org.mozilla.javascript package.  Underlying issue in the reflection API exists in those packages and is fixed in upcoming updates to ensure it can not be exploited using some other way.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 currently do not provide any browser plugin for use with OpenJDK 7 packages.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 includes IcedTea-Web browser plugin (in icedtea-web package), which currently only uses OpenJDK 6 packages (java-1.6.0-openjdk).   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-16 18:27:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:0165 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0165.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=894172#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-11 18:57:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0626 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0626.html>   ``` |  |

# 0 day 1.7u10 (CVE-2013-0422) spotted in the Wild - Disable Java Plugin NOW !

Was wondering what to do with that...Disclose, do not Disclose.

Hundreds of thousands of hits daily where i found it. This could be a cause mayhem.
I think it's better to make some noise about it.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# USN-1693-1: OpenJDK 7 vulnerabilities

16 January 2013

OpenJDK 7 could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted Java applet.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [openjdk-7](/security/cves?package=openjdk-7) - Open Source Java implementation

## Details

It was discovered that OpenJDK 7's security mechanism could be bypassed via

Java applets. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, a

remote attacker could exploit this to perform arbitrary code execution as

the user invoking the program.

Residents across the United States are being inundated with text messages purporting to come from toll road operators like E-ZPass, warning that recipients face fines if a delinquent toll fee remains unpaid. Researchers say the surge in SMS spam coincides with new features added to a popular commercial phishing kit sold in China that makes it simple to set up convincing lures spoofing toll road operators in multiple U.S. states.

Microsoft today unleashed updates to plug a whopping 161 security vulnerabilities in Windows and related software, including three “zero-day” weaknesses that are already under active attack. Redmond’s inaugural Patch Tuesday of 2025 bundles more fixes than the company has shipped in one go since 2017.

Besieged by scammers seeking to phish user accounts over the telephone, Apple and Google frequently caution that they will never reach out unbidden to users this way. However, new details about the internal operations of a prolific voice phishing gang show the group routinely abuses legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices.

Adam Griffin is still in disbelief over how quickly he was robbed of nearly $500,000 in cryptocurrencies. A scammer called using a real Google phone number to warn his Gmail account was being hacked, sent email security alerts directly from google.com, and ultimately seized control over the account by convincing him to click “yes” to a Google prompt on his mobile device.

Phishing attacks increased nearly 40 percent in the year ending August 2024, with much of that growth concentrated at a small number of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) — such as .shop, .top, .xyz — that attract scammers with rock-bottom prices and no meaningful registration requirements, new research finds. Meanwhile, the nonprofit entity that oversees the domain name industry is moving forward with plans to introduce a slew of new gTLDs.

The financial technology firm Finastra is investigating the alleged large-scale theft of information from its internal file transfer platform, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Finastra, which provides software and services to 45 of the world’s top 50 banks, notified customers of a potential breach after a cybercriminal began selling more than 400 gigabytes of data purportedly stolen from the company.

Not long ago, the ability to remotely track someone’s daily movements just by knowing their home address, employer, or place of worship was considered a powerful surveillance tool that should only be in the purview of nation states. But a new lawsuit in a likely constitutional battle over a New Jersey privacy law shows that anyone can now access this capability, thanks to a proliferation of commercial services that hoover up the digital exhaust emitted by widely-used mobile apps and websites.

Alert
# Oracle Java 7 Security Manager Bypass Vulnerability

Last RevisedFebruary 06, 2013
Alert CodeTA13-010A

### Systems Affected

Any system using Oracle Java 7 (1.7, 1.7.0) including

* Java Platform Standard Edition 7 (Java SE 7)
* Java SE Development Kit (JDK 7)
* Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE 7)
* OpenJDK 7 and 7u
* IcedTea 2.x (IcedTea7 2.x)

All versions of Java 7 through update 10 are affected.  Web browsers using the Java 7 plug-in are at high risk.

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Java 7 restricts the permissions of Java applets could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system.

A vulnerability in the Java Security Manager allows a Java applet to grant itself permission to execute arbitrary code. An attacker could use social engineering techniques to entice a user to visit a link to a website hosting a malicious Java applet. An attacker could also compromise a legitimate web site and upload a malicious Java applet (a "drive-by download" attack).

Any web browser using the Java 7 plug-in is affected. The Java Deployment Toolkit plug-in and Java Web Start can also be used as attack vectors.

Reports indicate this vulnerability is being actively exploited, and exploit code is publicly available.

Further technical details are available in Vulnerability Note [VU#625617](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617).

### Impact

By convincing a user to load a malicious Java applet or Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the Java plug-in process.

### Solution

**Update Java**

[Oracle Security Alert CVE-2013-0422](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2013-0422-1896849.html) states that Java 7 Update 11 ([7u11](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u11-relnotes-1896856.html)) addresses this (CVE-2013-0422) and a different but equally severe vulnerability (CVE-2012-3174).

Java 7 Update 11 sets the default Java security settings to "High" so that users will be prompted before running unsigned or self-signed Java applets.

**Disable Java in web browsers**

This and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered. To defend against this and future Java vulnerabilities, consider disabling Java in web browsers until adequate updates are available. As with any software, unnecessary features should be disabled or removed as appropriate for your environment.

Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to disable Java content in web browsers through the Java control panel applet. From [Setting the Security Level of the Java Client](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable):

For installations where the highest level of security is required, it is possible to entirely prevent *any* Java apps (signed or unsigned) from running in a browser by de-selecting Enable Java content in the browser in the Java Control Panel under the Security tab.

If you are unable to update to Java 7 Update 10 please see the solution section of Vulnerability Note [VU#636312](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312#solution) for instructions on how to disable Java on a per-browser basis.[Vulnerability Note VU#625617](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617)

# [SE-2012-01] 'Fix' for Issue 32 exploited by new Java 0-day code

---

*From*: Security Explorations <contact () security-explorations com>

```

Hello All,

We were notified today of ongoing attacks with the use of a new
Java vulnerability affecting latest version 7 Update 10 of the
software [1][2].

Due to the unpatched status of Issue 50 [3] and some inquiries
received regarding whether the attack code found exploited this
bug, we had a quick look at the exploit code found in the wild.
Below, we are providing you with the results of our analysis.

The 0-day attack code that was spotted in the wild today is yet
another instance of Java security vulnerabilities that stem from
insecure implementation of Reflection API [4].

The new attack is a combination of two vulnerabilities. The first
flaw allows to load arbitrary (restricted) classes by the means
of findClass method of com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.MBeanInstantiator
class. This can be accomplished by the means of this code:

  public static Class loadClass(String name) throws Throwable {
    JmxMBeanServerBuilder jmxbsb=new JmxMBeanServerBuilder();

```
 JmxMBeanServer
jmxbs=(JmxMBeanServer)jmxbsb.newMBeanServer("",null,null);
```

    MBeanInstantiator mbi=jmxbs.getMBeanInstantiator();

    return mbi.findClass(name,(ClassLoader)null);
  }

The problem stems from insecure call to Class.forName() method.

The second issue abuses the new Reflection API to successfully
obtain and call MethodHandle objects that point to methods and
constructors of restricted classes. This second issue relies on
invokeWithArguments method call of java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle
class, which has been already a subject of a security problem
(Issue 32 that we reported to Oracle on Aug 31, 2012).

The company had released a fix for Issue 32 in Oct 2012. However,
it turns out that the fix was not complete as one can still abuse
invokeWithArguments method to setup calls to invokeExact method
with a trusted system class as a target method caller. This time
the call is however done to methods of new Reflection API (from
java.lang.invoke.* package), of which many rely on security checks
conducted against the caller of the target method.

Oracle's fix for Issue 32 relies on a binding of the MethodHandle
object to the caller of a target method / constructor if it denotes
a potentially dangerous Reflection API call. This binding has a
form of injecting extra stack frame from a caller's Class Loader
namespace into the call stack prior to issuing a security sensitive
method call. Calls to blacklisted Reflection APIs are detected with
the use of isCallerSensitive method of MethodHandleNatives class.
The blacklisting however focuses primarily on Core Reflection API
(Class.forName(), Class.getMethods(), etc.) and does not take into
account the possibility to use new Reflection API calls. As a result,
the invokeWithArguments trampoline used in the context of a system
(privileged) lookup object may still be abused for gaining access to
restricted classes, their methods, etc.

The above is important in the context of a security check that is
implemented by the Lookup class. Its checkSecurityManager method
compares the Class Loader (CL) namespace of the caller class of a
target find[*] method (findStatic, findVirtual, etc.) with the CL
namespace of a class for which a given find operation is conducted.
Access to restricted packages is not checked only if Class Loader
namespaces are equal (the case for public lookup object, but also
for a trusted method caller such as invokeWithArguments invoked for
not blacklisted method).

The exploit vector used by the attack code is the same as the one
we used for second instance of our Proof of Concept code for Issue
32 (reported to Oracle on 17-Sep-2012). This exploit vector relies
on sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.GeneratedClassLoader class
in order to define a fully privileged attacker's class in a system
Class Loader namespace. From that point all security checks can be
easily disabled.

This is not the first time Oracle fails to "sync" security of Core
and new Reflection APIs. Just to mention the Reflection API filter.

This is also not the first time Oracle's own investigation / analysis
of security issues turns out to be not sufficiently comprehensive.
Just to mention Issue 50, which was discovered in the code addressed
by the company not so long ago...

Bugs are like mushrooms, in many cases they can be found in a close
proximity to those already spotted. It looks Oracle either stopped
the picking too early or they are still deep in the woods...

Thank you.

Best Regards
Adam Gowdiak

Besieged by scammers seeking to phish user accounts over the telephone, Apple and Google frequently caution that they will never reach out unbidden to users this way. However, new details about the internal operations of a prolific voice phishing gang show the group routinely abuses legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices.

Cybercriminals are selling hundreds of thousands of credential sets stolen with the help of a cracked version of Acunetix, a powerful commercial web app vulnerability scanner, new research finds. The cracked software is being resold as a cloud-based attack tool by at least two different services, one of which KrebsOnSecurity traced to an information technology firm based in Turkey.

Phishing attacks increased nearly 40 percent in the year ending August 2024, with much of that growth concentrated at a small number of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) — such as .shop, .top, .xyz — that attract scammers with rock-bottom prices and no meaningful registration requirements, new research finds. Meanwhile, the nonprofit entity that oversees the domain name industry is moving forward with plans to introduce a slew of new gTLDs.

Two men have been arrested for allegedly stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies that used the cloud data storage company Snowflake, but a third suspect — a prolific hacker known as Kiberphant0m — remains at large and continues to publicly extort victims. However, this person’s identity may not remain a secret for long: A careful review of Kiberphant0m’s daily chats across multiple cybercrime personas suggests they are a U.S. Army soldier who is or was recently stationed in South Korea.

The financial technology firm Finastra is investigating the alleged large-scale theft of information from its internal file transfer platform, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Finastra, which provides software and services to 45 of the world’s top 50 banks, notified customers of a potential breach after a cybercriminal began selling more than 400 gigabytes of data purportedly stolen from the company.

Not long ago, the ability to remotely track someone’s daily movements just by knowing their home address, employer, or place of worship was considered a powerful surveillance tool that should only be in the purview of nation states. But a new lawsuit in a likely constitutional battle over a New Jersey privacy law shows that anyone can now access this capability, thanks to a proliferation of commercial services that hoover up the digital exhaust emitted by widely-used mobile apps and websites.

# The path to infection - Eye glance at the first line of "Russian Underground" - focused on Ransomware

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c5LwFfgffI0/VnPoBn99MlI/AAAAAAAAFYU/lGPqkI3CO9k/s200/2015-12-18_12h03_29.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c5LwFfgffI0/VnPoBn99MlI/AAAAAAAAFYU/lGPqkI3CO9k/s1600/2015-12-18_12h03_29.png)

One year since I started "active" actions in understanding what is on the other side of malware/mass infection campaign. Will share in one picture how i figure things.
*( I hope to have many feedback to fix/adjust my understanding )*

I will focus on the Ransomware case but most parts are valid for many other "blind mass attack" (as Ransomware is a specific case of Botnet )

Straight to the visual :

| Eye glance at the first line of "Russian Underground"The path to infection [Credits](http://pastebin.com/HsugYbhL) for some models used hereNote: New infection vector appeared in early 2013 - RDP compromission then Crypto Ransomware |

And now here are basic explanation to read the illustration (even if most of you don't need it :P ).
I won't talk about what happen after infection (data/voucher code reselling, money laundering, etc...). It's another story.

 *(will try to add here a table of content or list of anchor links)*

### -Poke A Mole Concept

I will first talk about a concept to which i will often refer, the forest hiding the tree, or the "Poke A Mole board".
On previous map, most of the steps are represented by a single node but even small groups will hide the real node/bad server behind redirectors/reverse proxies. It's easier to recreate a redirector than rebuild a new server once a node is burnt (read: blacklisted by browser internal protections or antivirus or other filtering tools).
The smallest group will have one server and multiple IP, then we'll see some groups with one server and one redirector with multiple IPs, and bigger groups can daily add many redirectors.

This is how you can reach this kind of architecture for a single exploit kit :

|  |
| --- |
| Cool EK Poke A Mole Board (Snapshot as [I saw it](https://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2012/10/newcoolek.html) on 13/10/2012)Too small ? : <http://i.minus.com/ibbdTxd1LpqqHr.jpg> |

or even bigger ( [I saw one Blackhole with up to 2400 ips](https://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2012/09/ULockerAS36444BHEK.html) available to reach it...at least 1940 when it was also hosting a Ransomware C&C)

Same goes for Domains. Having hundreds of domain allow bad guy to switch from one to another and escape domain based blacklisting. Managing domain generation/rotation can be manual, "outsourced", built-in the tools or managed by dedicated tools. I'll give more details later.

One other great illustration for both, was back in february/march 2012, the Sinowal/Torpig group hosting its custom Blackhole on infected nodes of its botnet and making it reachable via Fast-Flux && DGA (based on Twitter trends).

### -Infection vector :

this is how you get infected (as I focus on *Ransomware*, I won't talk about USB/Network Share etc..
<edit 2013-03-25> Some crypto-ransomware are now deployed after RDP compromission. Bruteforce on windows server and Via Remote Desktop Protocol. </edit>

#### - Browsing Website :

[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EiyoBEzByZA/UL5uYKSYJRI/AAAAAAAADNc/ljq6Csm0Alw/s320/2_Infection.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EiyoBEzByZA/UL5uYKSYJRI/AAAAAAAADNc/ljq6Csm0Alw/s1600/2_Infection.jpg)
   - Compromised website : one website has been compromised either using a vulnerability (usually on outdated CMS) or using stolen credentials from owner, modified to redirect visitors to the infection.
There are a lot dedicated tools to manage a huge amount of iFrame on website with known credentials or kown vulns
[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vEVSdaG7jJc/UL89PDrN3fI/AAAAAAAADdg/t3SLPLgJ3gc/s320/screenshot_105.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vEVSdaG7jJc/UL89PDrN3fI/AAAAAAAADdg/t3SLPLgJ3gc/s1600/screenshot_105.png)[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EC3A8Da3c9U/UL89y7uVhpI/AAAAAAAADdo/m7ZKEa32iG0/s320/screenshot_1287.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EC3A8Da3c9U/UL89y7uVhpI/AAAAAAAADdo/m7ZKEa32iG0/s1600/screenshot_1287.png)
  - Malvertising : same via a malicious fake advert (see advertising platforms)

#### - Chat/mail

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JdqSlxeMtsQ/UL5uhn1NxaI/AAAAAAAADNk/kviKRiNY8P0/s320/2Social4.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JdqSlxeMtsQ/UL5uhn1NxaI/AAAAAAAADNk/kviKRiNY8P0/s1600/2Social4.jpg)    - link to compromised website or exploit kit
    - binary as attachement, or document with link to the exploit kit

*( Matsnu/Rannoh mainly spread by mail, and skype [was used to redirect](http://www.gfi.com/blog/skype-users-targeted-with-ransomware-and-click-fraud/) users to BH EK 2.0 then Ransomware )*

The tools :

|  |
| --- |
| A Nacha/Facebook themed spam Tool |

|  |
| --- |
| One more mailer |

To figure out more about that you can read:[Threat Outbreak Alerts](http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/threatOutbreak.x?i=77) (Cisco)[Dynamoo's Blog](http://blog.dynamoo.com/)
#### - Manual download

    - the victims download the binary by themselves thinking it's something else (a "free" version of a paid game, an indispensable video plugin, a disinfection tool, etc...)
#### - Push in botnet

[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-boPsA3z8ixI/UL51KEU1GXI/AAAAAAAADPE/vVLQV_to3gA/s320/5_C&C2.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-boPsA3z8ixI/UL51KEU1GXI/AAAAAAAADPE/vVLQV_to3gA/s1600/5_C%26C2.jpg)Not a "real" one as it's in fact an already infected computer which is being pushed another malware. ( *See for instance [Reveton pushed in a Smokebot](https://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2012/09/from-sakura-to-reveton-via-smoke-bot-or.html). I saw also [Lyposit](https://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2012/11/inside-view-of-lyposit-aka-for-its.html), Vicas, [Urausy](https://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2012/09/urausy-is-invading-europe-targeting-3.html) pushed that way* ) .

Tools : Task option of most Botnet C&C panel

etc...
### Advertising Platforms

The platform can be legit or not. Clicksor, Plugrush, Adfly are often being victims of these kind of badvertisers. Some platform are built for that dark job. Malekal pointed a fake platform  [in this brilliant post](http://www.malekal.com/2012/11/20/en-megoads-fake-advertising-for-porn-websites/) about MegoADS
These platforms are used or abused by bad guys to push advertisement that will drive the user to the redirection infrastructure, often for instance fake porn website (see later).

| Cbeplay.P pushed by Sweet Orange via TrafficBroker Malvert |

[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VkncD1vDBBA/UL51bEW80XI/AAAAAAAADPM/NaBQ71CxRwg/s320/3_TDS_Traff.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VkncD1vDBBA/UL51bEW80XI/AAAAAAAADPM/NaBQ71CxRwg/s1600/3_TDS_Traff.jpg)This block cover all the steps between the first redirection to the exploitation. This is the "Traffer Zone".
Depending on how many actors are involved/how mature are the groups you can see a huge amount of hops.

The first step after malvertising is TDS or fake website with redirect js

Tools:

When modifying a saved legit page is not enough to build a fake site, there are dedicated tools to do this.

| Fakemaker (one fake website builder) |

(more here :  <http://kafeine.minus.com/lsInqkPcgjHSY> )

In some case the fake website is used to "prepare" the victim. For instance to increase conversion rate (people paying among infected people) on ransomware some traffer do not hesitate to redirect you to a fake Child porn website (but with real images). Victim shocked before being presented a pseudo law enforcement warning.

Dedicated TDS. Those TDS can be hidden behind forest of redirectors/reverse proxies.
They are redirecting traffic based on country/browser depending on the needs (client requests).
One TDS will often serve different exploit kits depending on the countries/sources of people hitting it.

The RunForestRun campaign that was including DGA was a traffer side work.
The js were redirecting to a TDS who could then redirect to other TDS or to Exploit Kits (We saw at least Blackhole and Redkit).

### Traffic Exchange Platforms

Won't spend a lot of time here. These are places where traffer/EK operators can register and can sell/buy traffic. There are tools to build this kind of platform

### Domain rotator sytem

Tools/utility that cover the need for fast/mass domain rotation.Most exploit kits have built-in features for this.This was one of the addition to the version 2.0 of Blackhole Exploit Kit.This is one of the big feature of Redkit (domain every hours, path every few seconds) , it has also been added to ProPack. The group behind the Cool EK pushing Reveton has also a backend system (I saw at least ten IPs ) with an api to serve active hijacked domains to traffers
Tools :
 Qpi Rotator

### Sometimes the crypt provider allow you to add more features than just bypassing Antivirus :

### Underground Forums

This is a key point where all independent actors exchanges service offers and establish contacts. Reading this blog you'll see many screenshots of announcement or services offer. Forum are also often the place where conflict are solved in section often named "Black"/"Blacklist".

If you want an idea on the diversity of services take a look at this advert collection :
<http://kafeine.minus.com/mnrcD1JxAzu2U> (focused on : Traffing, Hosting, Crypting, Virtual Currency Echange, Ransomware affiliates etc...). These advert are found inside services (Forums, Scan, Crypt, Blackhole..etc)

So behind an infection there is a dark economy in turmoil with a lot of specialized individuals/groups.
We can spend a lot of time discussing about each hat/job in the path. From the domain registration to the hosting, from the coding to the spreading but it was just an eye glance :)

Not long ago, miscreants who wanted to buy an exploit kit — automated software that helps booby-trap hacked sites to deploy malicious code — had to be fairly well-connected, or at least have access to semi-private underground forums. These days, some exploit kit makers are brazenly advertising and offering their services out in the open, marketing their wares as browser vulnerability “stress-test platforms.”

### Confirmed: Java only fixed one of the two bugs.

One of things we tend to do when preparing our Java exploitation [training](http://www.immunityinc.com/infiltrate/training.html) as part of the INFILTRATE master class, is to analyze the past and the present in order to not only teach the specifics of exploitation but to build in our students their offensive "intuition".
```

```

This is an important characteristic if you want to win in the world of exploitation, because these days exploits are not served on a [fresh cucumber nitro-tini](http://bartongtherestaurant.com/drinks/speciality-cocktails/) but rather you will need picks and shovels to open your way into it.

This is the case of the recent MBeanInstantiator exploit, which combines two bugs in order to remotely execute code.

And sometimes for everyone involved in the offensive world, this mean you need to look at the patch with special detail, because sometimes the vendor stops the worm/0day exploit  with a patch, but doesn't necessary fix all of the associated problems. And of course, being only human, sometimes the vendor's team just plain messes up the patch.

After further analysis of the Oracle Java patch (Java 7 update 11),  Immunity was able to identify that only one of the two bugs were fixed, making Java still vulnerable to one of the bugs used in the exploit found in the wild.

The patch did stop the exploit, fixing one of its components. But an attacker with enough knowledge of the Java code base and the help of another zero day bug to replace the one fixed can easily continue compromising users. (Assuming they now use a signed Java applet - one of the other changes introduced in this patch.)

Java is indeed a constant target for attackers, and nobody should be surprised if an attacker just replaces the patched bug with a different one and starts compromising machines again. This is why it is important for Oracle and their user base to start paying special attention to each bug because with an exploitation chain as the one is needed these days, every bug matters.

Immunity this year is doing a five day long [Master class](http://www.immunityinc.com/infiltrate/training.html) at Infiltrate (April, 15-19) where we will spent a full day on Java exploitation, teaching our student how to analyze patch, understand the Java code base and how to combine multiple bugs to obtain full exploitation.

# Oracle Patch

Oracle released a patch for these[2 vulnerabilities](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2013-0422-1896849.html) and[two different CVE's were assigned](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/entry/security_alert_for_cve_2013) to them.

The patch for the Recursive Reflection vulnerability (CVE-2013-0422) can be seen in the *java.lang.invoke.MethodHandleNatives.isCallerSensitive* method:

|  |
| --- |
| *isCallerSensitive diff between Java 7 update 10 and 11* |

And also *sun.reflect.misc.MethodUtil* class was changed to include some more checks:

```
 public static Object invoke(Method paramMethod, Object paramObject, Object[] paramArrayOfObject)
throws InvocationTargetException, IllegalAccessException
{
if  ((paramMethod.getDeclaringClass().equals(AccessController.class)) ||
    ((paramMethod.getDeclaringClass().equals(MethodHandles.class)) &&
     (paramMethod.getName().equals("lookup"))) ||
    ((paramMethod.getDeclaringClass().equals(MethodHandles.Lookup.class)) &&
    ((paramMethod.getName().startsWith("find")) ||
     (paramMethod.getName().startsWith("bind")) ||
     (paramMethod.getName().startsWith("unreflect")))) ||
    (paramMethod.getDeclaringClass().equals(Method.class)))
{
    throw new InvocationTargetException(
       new UnsupportedOperationException("invocation not supported"));
}

    [...]

}

```

However, the patch (which is Java 7 update 11) doesn't show any difference at all in the classes inside *com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver* package.

It appears then that the *MBeanInstantiator.findClass* vulnerability (CVE-2013-0422) is still there in the latest Java update.

In fact, running a simple test shows that restricted classes can still be retrieved with this bug.

A simple PoC like this can be used to see the situation:

```
import java.applet.Applet;
import com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer;
import com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServerBuilder;
import com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.MBeanInstantiator;

public class Test9 extends Applet {
 public void test1() {
  System.out.println("RUNNING TEST1");
  try {

# MbeanInstantiator.findClass vulnerability

Over our investigation of the *com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.MBeanInstantiator.findClass and**com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.MBeanInstantiator.loadClass* we found that the implementation on JDK6 and JDK7 are the same, which led us at first to the wrong conclusion that both were vulnerable. After further research we found that **although the *MBeanInstantiator*
code is the same in both versions, JDK/JRE 6 cannot be exploited.**

There is a flag called
*com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer.interceptorsEnabled*
that determines if *MbeanServerInterceptors* are enabled or not
and that value is set in the *com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer*
constructor.

In JDK7, the public static method
*com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer.newMBeanServer(String,
MBeanServer, MBeanServerDelegate, boolean)* directly
calls the constructor
*com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer.JmxMBeanServer(String,
MBeanServer, MBeanServerDelegate, MBeanInstantiator, boolean,
boolean)* where the
interceptorsEnabled flag is fully controlled.

JDK6
implementation is different because it calls another constructor that
ignores the flag passed to the *newMbeanServer*
method and always sets the flag to false.

This
is what is preventing an attacker from getting a *MbeanInstantiator*
instance to then use the findClass method.

We can clearly see
that the call hierarchy is different in JDK6 and JDK7

|  |
| --- |
| *JDK7 MBeanInstantiator constructor call hierarchy* |

|  |
| --- |
| *JDK6 MBeanInstantiator constructor call hierarchy* |

This last image clearly shows that the
*newMBeanServer* method is calling a different constructor that
sets the flag to False.

# Recursive Reflection Vulnerability

The vulnerability is that the new
reflection API security checks were passed because a trusted caller
from the JDK (*java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle*)
was retrieved from the frame's stack, as was explained in the
analysis.

We came to the conclusion that
this happened due to an error in the
*sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass*implementation
that failed to skip frames related to the new reflection API, but
this was not correct.

I'd like to thank
Michael 'mihi' Schierl for pointing out that the reason behind the
situation was not what I suspected but something else. Learning from
mistakes is good :)

You can see the
details in [Michael's post](http://schierlm.users.sourceforge.net/CVE-2013-0422.html).

**Update:** According to mitre.org, CVE-2013-0422 includes  the MBeanInstantiator and the Recursive Reflection issue (Even though MBeanInstantiator is not fixed on the last Java release). CVE-2012-3174 is actually for an unspecified vulnerability with no publicly known details.

CVE-2012-3174 is \*not\* "the Recursive Reflection vulnerability." It is a distinct vulnerability from anything used in the exploits/PoCs for CVE-2013-0422.

# Zero-Day Java Exploit Debuts in Crimeware

January 10, 2013

[73 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comments)

The hackers who maintain **Blackhole** and **Nuclear Pack —** competing crimeware products that are made to be stitched into hacked sites and use browser flaws to foist malware — say they’ve added a brand new exploit that attacks a previously unknown and currently unpatched security hole in **Java**.

The curator of Blackhole, a miscreant who uses the nickname “Paunch,” announced yesterday on several Underweb forums that the Java zero-day was a “New Year’s Gift,” to customers who use his exploit kit. Paunch bragged that his was the first to include the powerful offensive weapon, but shortly afterwards the same announcement was made by the maker and seller of Nuclear Pack.

According to both crimeware authors, the vulnerability exists in all versions of Java 7, including the latest — **Java 7 Update 10**. This information could not be immediately verified, but if you have Java installed, it would be a very good idea to [unplug Java from your browser](http://krebsonsecurity.com/how-to-unplug-java-from-the-browser/ "http://krebsonsecurity.com/how-to-unplug-java-from-the-browser/"), or uninstall this program entirely if you don’t need it. I will update this post as more information becomes available.

**Update, 8:47 a.m. ET: Alienvault Labs** say they have [reproduced and verified](http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2013/new-year-new-java-zeroday/ "http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2013/new-year-new-java-zeroday/") the claims of a new Java zero-day that exploits a vulnerability ([CVE-2013-0422](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0422)) in fully-patched versions of Java 7.

**Update, 11:46 a.m. ET:** As several readers have noted, Java 7 Update 10 ships with a feature that makes it far simpler to unplug Java from the browser than in previous. Oracle’s instructions for using that feature are [here](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml "http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml"), and the folks at DHS’s U.S.-CERT are now [recommending](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617 "http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617") this method as well.

   Unplugging Java from the browser…just so happens that this kind of breaks the web.

   How about putting the browser in a containerized malware airlock – segregating it and other targeted applications from the host? Then how about putting advanced behavioral detection capabilities in that environment so you can spot and kill exploits regardless of signature?

   That’s what we do here at Invincea…invite folks out there to hit us up for a trial…www.invincea.com

      Unplugging Java breaks the Web? That seems like hyperbole to me. I haven’t had Java plugged into any of the browsers I use for surfing the Web for the past two years, and I haven’t missed it once.

      Now, if we’re talking about Javascript, I’d agree with you that, unfortunately, turning off Javascript completely breaks the Web.

      A happy medium is Noscript, Notscripts or some kind of script control environment, but really, regular users should not have Java installed unless they have a specific need for it.

         I fully agree to Brian…as a private User I do not necessarily need Java at all…but if corporate uses web apps based on Java, disabling Java in general is no option…unfortunately. And I do not see any solution for using Java reg. Internal web apps, but not using it when surfing the Internet…

         Well, we could use 2 different browsers, one for each part…or does anyone see an easy to be configured alternative?

         I also don’t consider Java Applets as relevant for any web user experience.

         BUT certain vendors rely on Java Applet technology, and – guess what – even certain security authentication mechanisms. One such authentication mechanism is the national SSO-solution in Denmark, called NemID (EasyID). It is used for 95% of banks and almost all interactions with public authorities, including the IRS.

         To make matters worse, NemID has told us all \*not\* to follow the advise of turning off JVM browser plugins – simply because noone would be able to logon anywhere if we did.

         Denmark is now officially sitting ducks for drive-by applet attacks.

         What we need to do asap is getting rid of JVMs as browser plugins. Java, Silverlight, Flash, etc altogether.

         I think there is still a lot of confusion when it comes to Java(JRE) and JavaScript. People get it mixed up a lot ;). Personally, i haven’t seen a Java applet used in a very long time on any consumer/end user site.

      I never install Java on any of my systems and I practically never run across a website that needs it. It happens maybe once or twice a year and then it usually is a very old site that uses Java to do things that other sites do using Flahs or jquery.

      Unlike JavaScript, using Java in the browser has become something of the past.

   Is there any reason to unplug Java manually rather than use the new “Enable Java content in browser” setting in Java 7 update 10?

   Unchecking the setting appears to completely remove the Java extension/add-on from IE and Firefox. Is there something it misses that leaves browser vulnerable?

   1. [BrianKrebs](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com)  Post author[January 10, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140220)

      If that works, great to hear. I haven’t tried it myself yet. I assume Oracle added the feature because people were finding it hard to figure out how to completely unplug Java from the browser. It was so complicated, in fact, that US-CERT had to publish and republish several times advice for doing so in IE, which is particularly tricky. It would be nice to hear from them again whether this solution from Oracle really does the trick.

         Hi Brian,

         The new (as of 7u10) checkbox for unplugging Java from web browsers seems to work well. In fact, that’s currently the only guidance that I’ve provided in: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617>

         I’d like to think that I was \*somewhat\* responsible for the motivation to add such a feature, but that’s perhaps just optimistic speculation. 🙂

            That’s great to hear. WD (Will Dormann) is being modest; he’s one of the main vuln research and advisory authors at US-CERT.

            Thanks for responding with that. I feel much better about recommending Oracle’s method now.

               That feature only exists in the latest version of Java 7, Update 10. If you are using Java 6, you will not see this option.

         The setting in the Java Control Panel seems to work well. Do you know if there is a command line/registry method of toggling this? Using the GUI doesn’t scale in a large environment.

            There is a command-line option for the Java installer called “WEB\_JAVA=0”, which configures Java at install time to be disabled for web browsers. It would seem to be a bit redundant to have to re-install Java on systems just to get the change rolled out. I’m still investigating to see if there’s a simpler way to do the same thing that doesn’t require a Java reinstall.

   Well here we go again with JRE, i fully removed this pile of crud after a nightmare install of version 1.6.0.19 in April 2010, only to find out a few days later that there was a new unpatched exploit, not missed it one bit!

   I’m using Java 6 until the bitter end (sometime in early- to mid-2013 for consumers). It’s had a lot less problems recently than has Java 7.

   For those requiring the Java plug-in on Windows to run Java applets, take Brian’s advice here:

   <http://krebsonsecurity.com/tools-for-a-safer-pc/>

   And either whitelist your allowed (or ‘trusted’) sites with the NoScript add-on for Firefox or the NotScripts extension for Chrome. Alternatively, download, install and configure Sandboxie to run your browser sandboxed as this will also sandbox the Java plug-in process when it runs.

   I only run Java on one desktop Linux system. In order for my browser to even know that Java exists on this system, I have to create a soft link to the Java plug-in file (as root). At the moment, the soft link doesn’t exist. Thus, there’s no Java plug-in.

   1. WD [January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140603)

      You do realize that Oracle has reportedly already been automatically updating Java 6 clients to Java 7, right?

      1. Rabid Howler Monkey [January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140692)

         Actually, I was not aware of the automatic upgrade to Java SE 7. But, it doesn’t matter to me as Oracle will provide an updated Java SE 6 JDK next month, February, 2013, which will be the last Java SE 6 update available to the public. I’ll upgrade to Java SE 7 either in June, 2013, or earlier if an exploit surfaces for Java SE 6 Update 39.

         As I stated previously, Java SE 7, has been hit more with zero-days recently than has Java SE 6. And the last two Java SE 7 zero-days have not affected Java SE 6. Also, note this text in the Oracle link you provided:

         “Oracle will start auto-updating Windows 32-bit, Java Runtime Environment (JRE) users from JRE 6 to JRE 7 in December 2012.

         Had I allowed Oracle to automatically upgrade my Java SE 6 to Java SE 7 last month, I would now be running a vulnerable JDK with an exploit-in-the wild. With Java SE 6, I’m not exposed to this.

         P.S. I’m pretty good about keeping my JDK up-to-date. And I do upgrade to the next version when updates are no longer available to the public for the current version.

         Here’s a link to an article that provides more perspective on my decision to stay with Java SE 6 to the bitter end:

         <http://blogs.computerworld.com/desktop-apps/21298/choosing-between-java-version-6-or-7>

         From Michael Horowitz’ Defensive Computing blog at ComputerWorld dated November 07, 2012 . I read the article shortly after it came out and pretty much agreed with it.

         Hope this helps.

            I could never get Java 6 to work on my Vista x64 system despite using the 32 bit version of IE. I was pleasantly shocked when it suddenly started working for site that needed it, after upgrading to Java 7. I have to have Java anyway, or I’d get rid of it in a heart beat.

    Well, I had to resort to clicking on “Manage Add-ons” in the “Tools” button and disabling anything that belongs to Java. I also had to click on “View” in the “Java Runtime Environment Settings” in the Java tab of the JCP and unchecking anything that belongs to Java.

       I too have seen this behavior. Probably a bug in the Java installer. Search your computer for javacpl.exe and run that. It’s likely in C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin

          I had the same problem with Java 6, and never could get it back even after researching everything I could find on it, and doing everything Oracle said to troubleshoot. I never could get it to work on sites that needed it either. But I only needed it for my router console, and at least that worked. This was true for both XP SP3 and Vista x64, at that time.

          Java 7 finally cured it. Curious? ?:|

    This creates a problem with trying to access my banking account!!! I have to have Java working in order to get into the US Banking account!!!

    The only way out – ICEWEASEL on a stick!! Knoppix Linux on a usb stick and boot from this – then do my banking and get the hell off. This method prevents anyone from addressing the hard drive as the program loads into ram and stays there and disappears when I’m done and, unless you tell it to, it will not store anything.

       It does not appear to affect Java 6. However since Java 6 will not see any updates after next month (February 2013), it probably wouldn’t be a good idea to stick with it.

       1. Rabid Howler Monkey [January 10, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140301)

          Well, I certainly wouldn’t change horses from Java 6 to Java 7 when there’s an exploit for Java 7 in-the-wild and there’s no patch available for the vulnerability(ies) making the exploit possible.

          I will run Java 6 after the planned February, 2013, update until either a vulnerability is disclosed or an exploit surfaces. A number of web sites publish advisories for software including Java SE 6. When disclosed, I will promptly upgrade to Java 7.

             Well if he uses Secunia PSI; he will probably get away with that, because it will promptly tell him if it is vulnerable or not. Only problem is – it will hound him for having end-of-life applications on board too. 🙁

          Just an example for clarification, Java SE 5 was EOL’d (End of Public Updates) in October, 2009. Vulnerabilities continue to be reported for Java SE 5 because of it’s continued support for enterprises that choose to pay Oracle for premier, extended or sustaining support:

    Is this only affecting oracle jre, or is it also affecting java from other vendors, ie IBM or icedtea ?

    1. WD [January 10, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140303)

       I’ve attempted to reproduce the exploit with icedtea, but without success. Though that’s certainly not enough to conclude that it’s not affected.

       With the last Java vul from August, it was concluded that OpenJDK was indeed affected as well, but I seem to recall having a similar experience just attempting to run the PoC as-is. Perhaps it needs a tweak or there are other factors at play. <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312>

          Redhat has confirmed that OpenJDK is affected. Part of the confusion of whether or not it was affected are because 1) The exploit takes advantage of more than one weakness in Java to achieve code execution. 2) The PoC sample is crafted to work with Oracle Java, but the fact that it doesn’t work with OpenJDK doesn’t mean that OpenJDK isn’t vulnerable.

    Do you have any suggestions for disabling the plugin en masse, that is on several hundred machines? That checkbox seems to change quite a few registry keys and a simpler way of doing it would be nice. A single registry key toggle or single command line to execute would be my ideal.

    I got a question regarding Chrome.

    Say, when I visit java.com and press “Do I have Java”, I have to verify that I want java to run. “run this time” or “run always for this website”.

    Doesn’t this work on malicious websites as well?

    Brian, would you be so kind as to fix your link to US-CERT? It’s missing the hyphen.

    The included “disable Java within browsers” did not work for me – I am currently running Java 7 Update 10 – but opening my Java Control Panel did not reveal the browser safety settings… my “About” reveals that the control panel is Java 7 Update 1 – kind of worrying really…. I am removing Java completely and doing a full Java reinstall at J7U10 to see if that changes – if not, Java is gone for the time being…

    OK – got to the bottom of this – my Win7 64-bit system had Java 7 Update 10 (32-bit) and Java 7 Update 1 (64-bit) – if you have a similar situation, probably a good idea to remove the 64-bit version at J7U1 and restart – as I am doing now…

    1. [Greg Hewitt-Long](http://www.compsecglobal.com) [January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140546)

       It seems odd to reply to my own post – but this is an update – J7U1-64-bit removed – restarted – CP reports J7R10 properly – but browser removal part of the CP is just NOT THERE. I am removing this Java completely and going a full install of J7U10 – will update again if I get the browser removal option within the CP after that has completed – also removing Java fx 2.1.1

    update: after removing all Java – restarting the computer – downloading the FULL installer of J7U10 – my Java control panel now shows the “enable Java content in the browser” option under the Security tab.

    With an installation that had incrementally updated through releases – the control panel did not show those option on my machine. What is the point of upgrading if not every piece of the software gets upgraded?!?

       Good to hear Greg – I wonder if Revo Uninstaller may help if it happens again?

    It seems completely unclear whether the issue exists in Java 6. Does anyone know?

    1. [BrianKrebs](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com)  Post author[January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140685)

       Steven, read the story and the comments. There are \*no\* indications that this vulnerability exists in Java 6. It is Java 7 specific.

       That said, Oracle will stop supporting Java 6 next month, and is already in the process of pushing Java 6 users to Java 7

       1. [BrianKrebs](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com)  Post author[January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140707)

          Allow me to put a finer point on it: There are no indications that bad guys/malware are exploiting this in anything but Java 7 right now.

          1. Jason [January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140850)

             Brian: we are experiencing confusion in preparing our response because the associated CVE (<http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0422>) shows versions back to 1.4 as vulnerable to this — that would mean a huge difference to us in what response requires this week, so can you provide any insight on why the CVE says more are vulnerable?

             1. [BrianKrebs](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com)  Post author[January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140907)

                I hope this answers your question of whether older versions of Java are vulnerable

                <http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-java-exploit/>

                From that Q&A

                Q: I’m using Java 6. Does that mean I don’t have to worry about this?

                A: There have been conflicting findings on this front, but all indications are that this particular flaw does not exist in anything older than Java 7. The description of this bug at the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), for example, states that the vulnerability is present in Java versions going back several years, including version 4 and 5. But Will Dormann, a security expert who’s been examining this flaw closely for CERT, said the NVD’s advisory is incorrect: CERT maintains that this vulnerability stems from a component that Oracle introduced with Java 7. Dormann points to a detailed technical analysis of the Java flaw by Adam Gowdiak of Security Explorations, a security research team that has alerted Java maker Oracle about a large number of flaws in Java. Gowdiak says Oracle tried to fix this particular flaw in a previous update but failed to address it completely.

    Any indication if this is only a java on Windows issue, or does it affect Mac and Linux users too?

    1. WD [January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140870)

       I have confirmed that Windows, OS X, and Linux users are all indeed affected.
45. Alex Bewster [January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140885)

    Does this affect Linux or is it confined to just Windows?

    1. Zsolt Sandor [January 16, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-142142)

       The bug is in the runtime library of Oracle’s Java, but it only means, that the cracker can run a program as a normal user (the user in it’s name the browser was started). It is also unlike that a hacker cares about linux, the target platforms are mostly windows. But, it does not mean your are invulnerable, only that most likely you won’t have a problem. I suggest however to switch off java in your browser, and if a page requires java (banking operations, etc.) use a separate browser only for that purpose.
47. Unforgiven [January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140913)

    According to this site there is no mention of Java 6 Update 36 or 37. I’m not saying that they’re safe but to be specifically not on the list is rather interesting.

    <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0422>

    1. Jason [January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140916)

       We considered that internally… but the decision to patch up internally, etc… and then find out it might be vulnerable with further research.
49. chupu [January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140962)

    Great Article.

    Given that nearly every other networked program out there including FireFox, Chrome, Outlook, Windows, iTunes, etc. have had recent exploits that allow arbitrary code to be executed, maybe they should all be disabled too! The arguments for removing Java from the machine are specious and reek of fear mongering. Given that Java is open source and has been been reviewed by thousands and used by millions, it should be riddled with far fewer security bugs than the closed source programs.

    In the short term, just configure the Java plug-in using the ControlPanel to request permission to run until Oracle releases a patch, which should be soon.

    1. JCitizen [January 13, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-141245)

       Maybe:

       But from everything I read on many tech sites everywhere; Java and Adobe are the TOP vectors for criminals bent on pwning your stuff!
53. godivademaus [January 14, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-141410)

    I am running on a mac 10.5.8 Leopard, on a powerPC, which means that a) I cannot update beyond this operating system because subsequent OS upgrades will not work on my powerPC chipset.

    Also, Adobe, and other software and utility developers have ceased to include my OS and my chipset among their included upgrades, therefore I only have java 6 and is not included among the automatic upgrades.

    So, can I assume from this that my machine would not be impacted from this recently discovered flaw in the Java SE 7?

    1. JCitizen [January 15, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-141572)

       I’m just guessing, but I would speculate that even if the malware could compromise your browser, they wouldn’t be able to do anything with it. I’ve tested some zero day threats that are supposed to work on Mac, only to find they can’t run on RISC architecture. In fact I’ve had some clients who were under attack by what was obviously concerted efforts by corporate espionage groups, who switched to old PowerPCs and have been able to run again. This doesn’t guarantee they aren’t still under surveillance, but at least they can operate their business.

       When you have the big guns after you, that can take over a new Mac Air with your cell phone! I assume using bluetooth. You know you are a target of interest!
55. Zsolt Sandor [January 16, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-142141)

    A solution to this problem is to install a portable firefox/chrome/etc. on your computer, where you have enabled java, and use this portable browser for accessing pages, which require java (government portal, banking).

    Disable java in the browser you use for regular surfing.

    Not very elegant way, but at least a safe one.
57. Rabid Howler Monkey [January 20, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-143610)

    More on portable apps (mentioned immediately above by Zsolt Sandor, thx Zsolt) and Java. For those that need access to Java applets served on important web sites and/or Java-based applications, portable apps might be a solution for some users. In fact, one might be able to go Java free on their PC.

    The Firefox portable app:

    <http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable>

    The portable Java Runtime Environment, jPortable:

    <http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/java_portable>

    When you need to access a web site serving Java applets, just plug-in the USB stick with your portable apps and do your browsing. When finished, safely remove the USB stick from the PC. And be sure to keep your portable browser and Java up-to-date.

    In addition, all or, perhaps, some of one’s Java-based apps (read JAR files) might also be placed on the USB stick and run via the Java portable launcher (it works with jPortable, above):

### Confirmed: Java only fixed one of the two bugs.

One of things we tend to do when preparing our Java exploitation [training](http://www.immunityinc.com/infiltrate/training.html) as part of the INFILTRATE master class, is to analyze the past and the present in order to not only teach the specifics of exploitation but to build in our students their offensive "intuition".
```

```

This is an important characteristic if you want to win in the world of exploitation, because these days exploits are not served on a [fresh cucumber nitro-tini](http://bartongtherestaurant.com/drinks/speciality-cocktails/) but rather you will need picks and shovels to open your way into it.

This is the case of the recent MBeanInstantiator exploit, which combines two bugs in order to remotely execute code.

And sometimes for everyone involved in the offensive world, this mean you need to look at the patch with special detail, because sometimes the vendor stops the worm/0day exploit  with a patch, but doesn't necessary fix all of the associated problems. And of course, being only human, sometimes the vendor's team just plain messes up the patch.

After further analysis of the Oracle Java patch (Java 7 update 11),  Immunity was able to identify that only one of the two bugs were fixed, making Java still vulnerable to one of the bugs used in the exploit found in the wild.

The patch did stop the exploit, fixing one of its components. But an attacker with enough knowledge of the Java code base and the help of another zero day bug to replace the one fixed can easily continue compromising users. (Assuming they now use a signed Java applet - one of the other changes introduced in this patch.)

Java is indeed a constant target for attackers, and nobody should be surprised if an attacker just replaces the patched bug with a different one and starts compromising machines again. This is why it is important for Oracle and their user base to start paying special attention to each bug because with an exploitation chain as the one is needed these days, every bug matters.

Immunity this year is doing a five day long [Master class](http://www.immunityinc.com/infiltrate/training.html) at Infiltrate (April, 15-19) where we will spent a full day on Java exploitation, teaching our student how to analyze patch, understand the Java code base and how to combine multiple bugs to obtain full exploitation.

# Oracle Patch

Oracle released a patch for these[2 vulnerabilities](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2013-0422-1896849.html) and[two different CVE's were assigned](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/entry/security_alert_for_cve_2013) to them.

The patch for the Recursive Reflection vulnerability (CVE-2013-0422) can be seen in the *java.lang.invoke.MethodHandleNatives.isCallerSensitive* method:

|  |
| --- |
| *isCallerSensitive diff between Java 7 update 10 and 11* |

And also *sun.reflect.misc.MethodUtil* class was changed to include some more checks:

```
 public static Object invoke(Method paramMethod, Object paramObject, Object[] paramArrayOfObject)
throws InvocationTargetException, IllegalAccessException
{
if  ((paramMethod.getDeclaringClass().equals(AccessController.class)) ||
    ((paramMethod.getDeclaringClass().equals(MethodHandles.class)) &&
     (paramMethod.getName().equals("lookup"))) ||
    ((paramMethod.getDeclaringClass().equals(MethodHandles.Lookup.class)) &&
    ((paramMethod.getName().startsWith("find")) ||
     (paramMethod.getName().startsWith("bind")) ||
     (paramMethod.getName().startsWith("unreflect")))) ||
    (paramMethod.getDeclaringClass().equals(Method.class)))
{
    throw new InvocationTargetException(
       new UnsupportedOperationException("invocation not supported"));
}

    [...]

}

```

However, the patch (which is Java 7 update 11) doesn't show any difference at all in the classes inside *com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver* package.

It appears then that the *MBeanInstantiator.findClass* vulnerability (CVE-2013-0422) is still there in the latest Java update.

In fact, running a simple test shows that restricted classes can still be retrieved with this bug.

A simple PoC like this can be used to see the situation:

```
import java.applet.Applet;
import com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer;
import com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServerBuilder;
import com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.MBeanInstantiator;

public class Test9 extends Applet {
 public void test1() {
  System.out.println("RUNNING TEST1");
  try {
   javax.management.MBeanServer ms = com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer
     .newMBeanServer("test", null, null, true);

   com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.MBeanInstantiator mi = ((com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer) ms)
     .getMBeanInstantiator();

   System.out.println("MBeanInstantiator = " + mi);
   Class clazz = mi.findClass(
     "sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.Context",
     (ClassLoader) null);
   System.out.println("clazz = " + clazz);
  } catch (Exception e) {
   e.printStackTrace();
  }

 }

 public void test2() {
  System.out.println("RUNNING TEST2");
  try {
   JmxMBeanServerBuilder sb = new JmxMBeanServerBuilder();
   JmxMBeanServer jxmMBS = (JmxMBeanServer) sb.newMBeanServer("",
     null, null);
   MBeanInstantiator mi = jxmMBS.getMBeanInstantiator();
   System.out.println("MBeanInstantiator = " + mi);
   Class clazz = mi.findClass("sun.misc.Unsafe", (ClassLoader) null);
   System.out.println("clazz = " + clazz);

  } catch (Exception e) {
   e.printStackTrace();
  }
 }

 public void init() {
  test1();
  System.out.println("--------------------------------------------");
  test2();
 }
}

```

The output of such code executed with Java 7 update 11 will be something like this:

# MbeanInstantiator.findClass vulnerability

Over our investigation of the *com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.MBeanInstantiator.findClass and**com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.MBeanInstantiator.loadClass* we found that the implementation on JDK6 and JDK7 are the same, which led us at first to the wrong conclusion that both were vulnerable. After further research we found that **although the *MBeanInstantiator*
code is the same in both versions, JDK/JRE 6 cannot be exploited.**

There is a flag called
*com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer.interceptorsEnabled*
that determines if *MbeanServerInterceptors* are enabled or not
and that value is set in the *com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer*
constructor.

In JDK7, the public static method
*com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer.newMBeanServer(String,
MBeanServer, MBeanServerDelegate, boolean)* directly
calls the constructor
*com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer.JmxMBeanServer(String,
MBeanServer, MBeanServerDelegate, MBeanInstantiator, boolean,
boolean)* where the
interceptorsEnabled flag is fully controlled.

JDK6
implementation is different because it calls another constructor that
ignores the flag passed to the *newMbeanServer*
method and always sets the flag to false.

This
is what is preventing an attacker from getting a *MbeanInstantiator*
instance to then use the findClass method.

We can clearly see
that the call hierarchy is different in JDK6 and JDK7

|  |
| --- |
| *JDK7 MBeanInstantiator constructor call hierarchy* |

|  |
| --- |
| *JDK6 MBeanInstantiator constructor call hierarchy* |

This last image clearly shows that the
*newMBeanServer* method is calling a different constructor that
sets the flag to False.

# Recursive Reflection Vulnerability

The vulnerability is that the new
reflection API security checks were passed because a trusted caller
from the JDK (*java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle*)
was retrieved from the frame's stack, as was explained in the
analysis.

We came to the conclusion that
this happened due to an error in the
*sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass*implementation
that failed to skip frames related to the new reflection API, but
this was not correct.

I'd like to thank
Michael 'mihi' Schierl for pointing out that the reason behind the
situation was not what I suspected but something else. Learning from
mistakes is good :)

You can see the
details in [Michael's post](http://schierlm.users.sourceforge.net/CVE-2013-0422.html).

**Update:** According to mitre.org, CVE-2013-0422 includes  the MBeanInstantiator and the Recursive Reflection issue (Even though MBeanInstantiator is not fixed on the last Java release). CVE-2012-3174 is actually for an unspecified vulnerability with no publicly known details.

CVE-2012-3174 is \*not\* "the Recursive Reflection vulnerability." It is a distinct vulnerability from anything used in the exploits/PoCs for CVE-2013-0422.

# Zero-Day Java Exploit Debuts in Crimeware

January 10, 2013

[73 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comments)

The hackers who maintain **Blackhole** and **Nuclear Pack —** competing crimeware products that are made to be stitched into hacked sites and use browser flaws to foist malware — say they’ve added a brand new exploit that attacks a previously unknown and currently unpatched security hole in **Java**.

The curator of Blackhole, a miscreant who uses the nickname “Paunch,” announced yesterday on several Underweb forums that the Java zero-day was a “New Year’s Gift,” to customers who use his exploit kit. Paunch bragged that his was the first to include the powerful offensive weapon, but shortly afterwards the same announcement was made by the maker and seller of Nuclear Pack.

According to both crimeware authors, the vulnerability exists in all versions of Java 7, including the latest — **Java 7 Update 10**. This information could not be immediately verified, but if you have Java installed, it would be a very good idea to [unplug Java from your browser](http://krebsonsecurity.com/how-to-unplug-java-from-the-browser/ "http://krebsonsecurity.com/how-to-unplug-java-from-the-browser/"), or uninstall this program entirely if you don’t need it. I will update this post as more information becomes available.

**Update, 8:47 a.m. ET: Alienvault Labs** say they have [reproduced and verified](http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2013/new-year-new-java-zeroday/ "http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2013/new-year-new-java-zeroday/") the claims of a new Java zero-day that exploits a vulnerability ([CVE-2013-0422](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0422)) in fully-patched versions of Java 7.

**Update, 11:46 a.m. ET:** As several readers have noted, Java 7 Update 10 ships with a feature that makes it far simpler to unplug Java from the browser than in previous. Oracle’s instructions for using that feature are [here](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml "http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml"), and the folks at DHS’s U.S.-CERT are now [recommending](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617 "http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617") this method as well.

   Unplugging Java from the browser…just so happens that this kind of breaks the web.

   How about putting the browser in a containerized malware airlock – segregating it and other targeted applications from the host? Then how about putting advanced behavioral detection capabilities in that environment so you can spot and kill exploits regardless of signature?

   That’s what we do here at Invincea…invite folks out there to hit us up for a trial…www.invincea.com

      Unplugging Java breaks the Web? That seems like hyperbole to me. I haven’t had Java plugged into any of the browsers I use for surfing the Web for the past two years, and I haven’t missed it once.

      Now, if we’re talking about Javascript, I’d agree with you that, unfortunately, turning off Javascript completely breaks the Web.

      A happy medium is Noscript, Notscripts or some kind of script control environment, but really, regular users should not have Java installed unless they have a specific need for it.

         I fully agree to Brian…as a private User I do not necessarily need Java at all…but if corporate uses web apps based on Java, disabling Java in general is no option…unfortunately. And I do not see any solution for using Java reg. Internal web apps, but not using it when surfing the Internet…

         Well, we could use 2 different browsers, one for each part…or does anyone see an easy to be configured alternative?

         I also don’t consider Java Applets as relevant for any web user experience.

         BUT certain vendors rely on Java Applet technology, and – guess what – even certain security authentication mechanisms. One such authentication mechanism is the national SSO-solution in Denmark, called NemID (EasyID). It is used for 95% of banks and almost all interactions with public authorities, including the IRS.

         To make matters worse, NemID has told us all \*not\* to follow the advise of turning off JVM browser plugins – simply because noone would be able to logon anywhere if we did.

         Denmark is now officially sitting ducks for drive-by applet attacks.

         What we need to do asap is getting rid of JVMs as browser plugins. Java, Silverlight, Flash, etc altogether.

         I think there is still a lot of confusion when it comes to Java(JRE) and JavaScript. People get it mixed up a lot ;). Personally, i haven’t seen a Java applet used in a very long time on any consumer/end user site.

      I never install Java on any of my systems and I practically never run across a website that needs it. It happens maybe once or twice a year and then it usually is a very old site that uses Java to do things that other sites do using Flahs or jquery.

      Unlike JavaScript, using Java in the browser has become something of the past.
3. Justin [January 10, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140211)

   Is there any reason to unplug Java manually rather than use the new “Enable Java content in browser” setting in Java 7 update 10?

   Unchecking the setting appears to completely remove the Java extension/add-on from IE and Firefox. Is there something it misses that leaves browser vulnerable?

   1. [BrianKrebs](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com)  Post author[January 10, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140220)

      If that works, great to hear. I haven’t tried it myself yet. I assume Oracle added the feature because people were finding it hard to figure out how to completely unplug Java from the browser. It was so complicated, in fact, that US-CERT had to publish and republish several times advice for doing so in IE, which is particularly tricky. It would be nice to hear from them again whether this solution from Oracle really does the trick.

      1. WD [January 10, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140225)

         Hi Brian,

         The new (as of 7u10) checkbox for unplugging Java from web browsers seems to work well. In fact, that’s currently the only guidance that I’ve provided in: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617>

         I’d like to think that I was \*somewhat\* responsible for the motivation to add such a feature, but that’s perhaps just optimistic speculation. 🙂

         1. [BrianKrebs](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com)  Post author[January 10, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140226)

            That’s great to hear. WD (Will Dormann) is being modest; he’s one of the main vuln research and advisory authors at US-CERT.

            Thanks for responding with that. I feel much better about recommending Oracle’s method now.

            Well, I opened up the Java Control Panel, but when I clicked on “Security”, I don’t see the “Enable Java Content in Browser”. This stinks! 🙁

               That feature only exists in the latest version of Java 7, Update 10. If you are using Java 6, you will not see this option.

         The setting in the Java Control Panel seems to work well. Do you know if there is a command line/registry method of toggling this? Using the GUI doesn’t scale in a large environment.

         1. WD [January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140675)

            There is a command-line option for the Java installer called “WEB\_JAVA=0”, which configures Java at install time to be disabled for web browsers. It would seem to be a bit redundant to have to re-install Java on systems just to get the change rolled out. I’m still investigating to see if there’s a simpler way to do the same thing that doesn’t require a Java reinstall.

   Well here we go again with JRE, i fully removed this pile of crud after a nightmare install of version 1.6.0.19 in April 2010, only to find out a few days later that there was a new unpatched exploit, not missed it one bit!

      This page says it includes Mac OS at the top, but no step-by-step. I found a Java control panel in System Preferences and turned it off similar to windows.

   I’m using Java 6 until the bitter end (sometime in early- to mid-2013 for consumers). It’s had a lot less problems recently than has Java 7.

   For those requiring the Java plug-in on Windows to run Java applets, take Brian’s advice here:

   <http://krebsonsecurity.com/tools-for-a-safer-pc/>

   And either whitelist your allowed (or ‘trusted’) sites with the NoScript add-on for Firefox or the NotScripts extension for Chrome. Alternatively, download, install and configure Sandboxie to run your browser sandboxed as this will also sandbox the Java plug-in process when it runs.

   I only run Java on one desktop Linux system. In order for my browser to even know that Java exists on this system, I have to create a soft link to the Java plug-in file (as root). At the moment, the soft link doesn’t exist. Thus, there’s no Java plug-in.

   1. WD [January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140603)

      You do realize that Oracle has reportedly already been automatically updating Java 6 clients to Java 7, right?

      1. Rabid Howler Monkey [January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140692)

         Actually, I was not aware of the automatic upgrade to Java SE 7. But, it doesn’t matter to me as Oracle will provide an updated Java SE 6 JDK next month, February, 2013, which will be the last Java SE 6 update available to the public. I’ll upgrade to Java SE 7 either in June, 2013, or earlier if an exploit surfaces for Java SE 6 Update 39.

         As I stated previously, Java SE 7, has been hit more with zero-days recently than has Java SE 6. And the last two Java SE 7 zero-days have not affected Java SE 6. Also, note this text in the Oracle link you provided:

         “Oracle will start auto-updating Windows 32-bit, Java Runtime Environment (JRE) users from JRE 6 to JRE 7 in December 2012.

         Had I allowed Oracle to automatically upgrade my Java SE 6 to Java SE 7 last month, I would now be running a vulnerable JDK with an exploit-in-the wild. With Java SE 6, I’m not exposed to this.

         P.S. I’m pretty good about keeping my JDK up-to-date. And I do upgrade to the next version when updates are no longer available to the public for the current version.
      3. Rabid Howler Monkey [January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140706)

         Here’s a link to an article that provides more perspective on my decision to stay with Java SE 6 to the bitter end:

         <http://blogs.computerworld.com/desktop-apps/21298/choosing-between-java-version-6-or-7>

         From Michael Horowitz’ Defensive Computing blog at ComputerWorld dated November 07, 2012 . I read the article shortly after it came out and pretty much agreed with it.

         Hope this helps.

            I could never get Java 6 to work on my Vista x64 system despite using the 32 bit version of IE. I was pleasantly shocked when it suddenly started working for site that needed it, after upgrading to Java 7. I have to have Java anyway, or I’d get rid of it in a heart beat.

    Well, I had to resort to clicking on “Manage Add-ons” in the “Tools” button and disabling anything that belongs to Java. I also had to click on “View” in the “Java Runtime Environment Settings” in the Java tab of the JCP and unchecking anything that belongs to Java.

          Avast has a VM built in for applications if you put the .exe file in their console. I’ve never tried it on a browser; but I’m using the free one, so I’m not even sure it is enabled.

    When I downloaded Java 7 (10), my icon in the Control Panel mysteriously disappeared, and therefore I cannot find any of the information needed to unplug Java. Can anyone help?

       I too have seen this behavior. Probably a bug in the Java installer. Search your computer for javacpl.exe and run that. It’s likely in C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin

       1. JCitizen [January 13, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-141241)

          I had the same problem with Java 6, and never could get it back even after researching everything I could find on it, and doing everything Oracle said to troubleshoot. I never could get it to work on sites that needed it either. But I only needed it for my router console, and at least that worked. This was true for both XP SP3 and Vista x64, at that time.

          Java 7 finally cured it. Curious? ?:|

    This creates a problem with trying to access my banking account!!! I have to have Java working in order to get into the US Banking account!!!

    The only way out – ICEWEASEL on a stick!! Knoppix Linux on a usb stick and boot from this – then do my banking and get the hell off. This method prevents anyone from addressing the hard drive as the program loads into ram and stays there and disappears when I’m done and, unless you tell it to, it will not store anything.

    Do we know if previous versions of Java (like 6) are affected? Or is this vulnerability specific to Java 7?

    1. WD [January 10, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140287)

       It does not appear to affect Java 6. However since Java 6 will not see any updates after next month (February 2013), it probably wouldn’t be a good idea to stick with it.

       1. Rabid Howler Monkey [January 10, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140301)

          Well, I certainly wouldn’t change horses from Java 6 to Java 7 when there’s an exploit for Java 7 in-the-wild and there’s no patch available for the vulnerability(ies) making the exploit possible.

          I will run Java 6 after the planned February, 2013, update until either a vulnerability is disclosed or an exploit surfaces. A number of web sites publish advisories for software including Java SE 6. When disclosed, I will promptly upgrade to Java 7.

             Well if he uses Secunia PSI; he will probably get away with that, because it will promptly tell him if it is vulnerable or not. Only problem is – it will hound him for having end-of-life applications on board too. 🙁

          Just an example for clarification, Java SE 5 was EOL’d (End of Public Updates) in October, 2009. Vulnerabilities continue to be reported for Java SE 5 because of it’s continued support for enterprises that choose to pay Oracle for premier, extended or sustaining support:

    Is this only affecting oracle jre, or is it also affecting java from other vendors, ie IBM or icedtea ?

    1. WD [January 10, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140303)

       I’ve attempted to reproduce the exploit with icedtea, but without success. Though that’s certainly not enough to conclude that it’s not affected.

       With the last Java vul from August, it was concluded that OpenJDK was indeed affected as well, but I seem to recall having a similar experience just attempting to run the PoC as-is. Perhaps it needs a tweak or there are other factors at play. <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312>

       1. WD [January 14, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-141467)

          Redhat has confirmed that OpenJDK is affected. Part of the confusion of whether or not it was affected are because 1) The exploit takes advantage of more than one weakness in Java to achieve code execution. 2) The PoC sample is crafted to work with Oracle Java, but the fact that it doesn’t work with OpenJDK doesn’t mean that OpenJDK isn’t vulnerable.

    Do you have any suggestions for disabling the plugin en masse, that is on several hundred machines? That checkbox seems to change quite a few registry keys and a simpler way of doing it would be nice. A single registry key toggle or single command line to execute would be my ideal.

    Hi Brian, I saw a link saying it affects all versions of Java. some of my environment is version 6 and some is 7. So I am confused about what to do.

    <http://www.csoonline.com/article/726227/java-zero-day-prompts-calls-again-to-disable-it>

    I got a question regarding Chrome.

    Say, when I visit java.com and press “Do I have Java”, I have to verify that I want java to run. “run this time” or “run always for this website”.

    Doesn’t this work on malicious websites as well?

    The included “disable Java within browsers” did not work for me – I am currently running Java 7 Update 10 – but opening my Java Control Panel did not reveal the browser safety settings… my “About” reveals that the control panel is Java 7 Update 1 – kind of worrying really…. I am removing Java completely and doing a full Java reinstall at J7U10 to see if that changes – if not, Java is gone for the time being…
37. [Greg Hewitt-Long](http://www.compsecglobal.com) [January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140543)

    OK – got to the bottom of this – my Win7 64-bit system had Java 7 Update 10 (32-bit) and Java 7 Update 1 (64-bit) – if you have a similar situation, probably a good idea to remove the 64-bit version at J7U1 and restart – as I am doing now…

    1. [Greg Hewitt-Long](http://www.compsecglobal.com) [January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140546)

       It seems odd to reply to my own post – but this is an update – J7U1-64-bit removed – restarted – CP reports J7R10 properly – but browser removal part of the CP is just NOT THERE. I am removing this Java completely and going a full install of J7U10 – will update again if I get the browser removal option within the CP after that has completed – also removing Java fx 2.1.1
39. [Greg Hewitt-Long](http://www.compsecglobal.com) [January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140553)

    update: after removing all Java – restarting the computer – downloading the FULL installer of J7U10 – my Java control panel now shows the “enable Java content in the browser” option under the Security tab.

    With an installation that had incrementally updated through releases – the control panel did not show those option on my machine. What is the point of upgrading if not every piece of the software gets upgraded?!?

    It seems completely unclear whether the issue exists in Java 6. Does anyone know?

    1. [BrianKrebs](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com)  Post author[January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140685)

       Steven, read the story and the comments. There are \*no\* indications that this vulnerability exists in Java 6. It is Java 7 specific.

       That said, Oracle will stop supporting Java 6 next month, and is already in the process of pushing Java 6 users to Java 7

       1. [BrianKrebs](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com)  Post author[January 11, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140707)

          Allow me to put a finer point on it: There are no indications that bad guys/malware are exploiting this in anything but Java 7 right now.

          1. Jason [January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140850)

             Brian: we are experiencing confusion in preparing our response because the associated CVE (<http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0422>) shows versions back to 1.4 as vulnerable to this — that would mean a huge difference to us in what response requires this week, so can you provide any insight on why the CVE says more are vulnerable?

             1. [BrianKrebs](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com)  Post author[January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140907)

                I hope this answers your question of whether older versions of Java are vulnerable

                <http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-java-exploit/>

                From that Q&A

                Q: I’m using Java 6. Does that mean I don’t have to worry about this?

                A: There have been conflicting findings on this front, but all indications are that this particular flaw does not exist in anything older than Java 7. The description of this bug at the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), for example, states that the vulnerability is present in Java versions going back several years, including version 4 and 5. But Will Dormann, a security expert who’s been examining this flaw closely for CERT, said the NVD’s advisory is incorrect: CERT maintains that this vulnerability stems from a component that Oracle introduced with Java 7. Dormann points to a detailed technical analysis of the Java flaw by Adam Gowdiak of Security Explorations, a security research team that has alerted Java maker Oracle about a large number of flaws in Java. Gowdiak says Oracle tried to fix this particular flaw in a previous update but failed to address it completely.

45. Alex Bewster [January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140885)

    Does this affect Linux or is it confined to just Windows?

       The bug is in the runtime library of Oracle’s Java, but it only means, that the cracker can run a program as a normal user (the user in it’s name the browser was started). It is also unlike that a hacker cares about linux, the target platforms are mostly windows. But, it does not mean your are invulnerable, only that most likely you won’t have a problem. I suggest however to switch off java in your browser, and if a page requires java (banking operations, etc.) use a separate browser only for that purpose.
47. Unforgiven [January 12, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-140913)

    According to this site there is no mention of Java 6 Update 36 or 37. I’m not saying that they’re safe but to be specifically not on the list is rather interesting.

       We considered that internally… but the decision to patch up internally, etc… and then find out it might be vulnerable with further research.

    Given that nearly every other networked program out there including FireFox, Chrome, Outlook, Windows, iTunes, etc. have had recent exploits that allow arbitrary code to be executed, maybe they should all be disabled too! The arguments for removing Java from the machine are specious and reek of fear mongering. Given that Java is open source and has been been reviewed by thousands and used by millions, it should be riddled with far fewer security bugs than the closed source programs.

    In the short term, just configure the Java plug-in using the ControlPanel to request permission to run until Oracle releases a patch, which should be soon.

       Maybe:

       But from everything I read on many tech sites everywhere; Java and Adobe are the TOP vectors for criminals bent on pwning your stuff!
53. godivademaus [January 14, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-141410)

    I am running on a mac 10.5.8 Leopard, on a powerPC, which means that a) I cannot update beyond this operating system because subsequent OS upgrades will not work on my powerPC chipset.

    Also, Adobe, and other software and utility developers have ceased to include my OS and my chipset among their included upgrades, therefore I only have java 6 and is not included among the automatic upgrades.

    So, can I assume from this that my machine would not be impacted from this recently discovered flaw in the Java SE 7?

    1. JCitizen [January 15, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-141572)

       I’m just guessing, but I would speculate that even if the malware could compromise your browser, they wouldn’t be able to do anything with it. I’ve tested some zero day threats that are supposed to work on Mac, only to find they can’t run on RISC architecture. In fact I’ve had some clients who were under attack by what was obviously concerted efforts by corporate espionage groups, who switched to old PowerPCs and have been able to run again. This doesn’t guarantee they aren’t still under surveillance, but at least they can operate their business.

       When you have the big guns after you, that can take over a new Mac Air with your cell phone! I assume using bluetooth. You know you are a target of interest!

    A solution to this problem is to install a portable firefox/chrome/etc. on your computer, where you have enabled java, and use this portable browser for accessing pages, which require java (government portal, banking).

    Disable java in the browser you use for regular surfing.

    Not very elegant way, but at least a safe one.
57. Rabid Howler Monkey [January 20, 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/zero-day-java-exploit-debuts-in-crimeware/#comment-143610)

    More on portable apps (mentioned immediately above by Zsolt Sandor, thx Zsolt) and Java. For those that need access to Java applets served on important web sites and/or Java-based applications, portable apps might be a solution for some users. In fact, one might be able to go Java free on their PC.

    The Firefox portable app:

    <http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable>

    The portable Java Runtime Environment, jPortable:

    <http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/java_portable>

    When you need to access a web site serving Java applets, just plug-in the USB stick with your portable apps and do your browsing. When finished, safely remove the USB stick from the PC. And be sure to keep your portable browser and Java up-to-date.

    In addition, all or, perhaps, some of one’s Java-based apps (read JAR files) might also be placed on the USB stick and run via the Java portable launcher (it works with jPortable, above):

## Java 7 fails to restrict access to privileged code

#### Vulnerability Note VU#625617

Original Release Date: 2013-01-10 | Last Revised: 2013-06-12

---

### Overview

Java 7 Update 10 and earlier versions of Java 7 contain a vulnerability that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.7 allows users to run Java applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Oracle has made the JRE available for multiple operating systems. OpenJDK is an open-source implementation of the Java platform, and the IcedTea project aims to make it easier to deploy OpenJDK, including a web browser plugin.  The Java JRE plug-in provides its own [Security Manager](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29). Typically, a web applet runs with a security manager provided by the browser or Java Web Start plugin. Oracle's document [states](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29), *"If there is a security manager already installed, this method first calls the security manager's* *checkPermission* *method with a* *RuntimePermission("setSecurityManager")* *permission to ensure it's safe to replace the existing security manager. This may result in throwing a* *SecurityException"**.* By leveraging the a vulnerability in the [Java Management Extensions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/index.html) (JMX) [MBean](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/mbeans/index.html) components, unprivileged Java code can access restricted classes. By using that vulnerability in conjunction with a second vulnerability involving recursive use of the Reflection API via the [invokeWithArguments](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandle.html#invokeWithArguments%28java.util.List%29) method of the [MethodHandle](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandle.html) class, an untrusted Java applet can escalate its privileges by calling the the [setSecurityManager()](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29) function to allow full privileges, without requiring code signing. Oracle Java 7 update 10 and earlier Java 7 versions are affected. OpenJDK 7, and subsequently [IcedTea](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.openjdk.distro-packaging.devel/21381), are also [affected](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=894172). The invokeWithArguments method was introduced with Java 7, so therefore Java 6 is not affected.This vulnerability is being attacked in the wild, and is reported to be incorporated into exploit kits. Exploit code for this vulnerability is also publicly available. We have confirmed that Oracle Java 7 installed on Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms are affected. Other platforms that use Oracle Java 7 may also be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Note that applications that use the Internet Explorer web content rendering components, such as Microsoft Office or Windows Desktop Search, may also be used as an attack vector for this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**[Oracle Security Alert CVE-2013-0422](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2013-0422-1896849.html) states that [Java 7 Update 11](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u11-relnotes-1896856.html) addresses this (CVE-2013-0422) and an equally severe, but distinct vulnerability (CVE-2012-3174). Immunity [has indicated](http://immunityproducts.blogspot.ca/2013/01/confirmed-java-only-fixed-one-of-two.html) that only the reflection vulnerability has been fixed and that the JMX MBean vulnerability remains. Java 7u11 sets the default Java security settings to "High" so that users will be prompted before running unsigned or self-signed Java applets.Unless it is absolutely necessary to run Java in web browsers, disable it as described below, even after updating to 7u11. This will help mitigate other Java vulnerabilities that may be discovered in the future.This issue has also been addressed in [IcedTea versions 2.1.4, 2.2.4, and 2.3.4](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/distro-pkg-dev/2013-January/021413.html). |
| --- |

| **Disable Java in web browsers**  Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to [disable Java content in web browsers](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml) through the Java control panel applet. Please see the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable) for more details.**Note**: Due to what appears to potentially be a bug in the Java installer, the Java Control Panel applet may be missing on some Windows systems. In such cases, the Java Control Panel applet may be launched by finding and executing javacpl.exe manually. This file is likely to be found in C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin or C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin.**Also note** that we have encountered situations on Windows where Java will crash if it has been disabled in the web browser as described above and then subsequently re-enabled. Depending on the browser used, this [Michael Horowitz has pointed out](http://blogs.computerworld.com/cybercrime-and-hacking/21664/understanding-new-security-java-7-update-11) that performing the same steps on Windows 7 will result in unsigned Java applets executing without prompting in Internet Explorer, despite what the "Security Level" slider in the Java Control panel applet is configured to use. We have confirmed this behavior with Internet Explorer on both Windows 7 and Vista. Reinstalling Java appears to correct both of these situations.System administrators wishing to deploy Java 7 Update 10 or later with the "Enable Java content in the browser" feature disabled can invoke the Java installer with the WEB\_JAVA=0 command-line option. More details are available in the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#install).Alternatively, Microsoft has released a [Fix it](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/05/29/java-when-you-cannot-let-go.aspx) that disables Java in the Internet Explorer web browser.**Restrict access to Java applets**Network administrators unable to disable Java in web browsers may be able to help mitigate this and other Java vulnerabilities by restricting access to Java applets. This may be accomplished by using proxy server rules, for example. Blocking or whitelisting web requests to .jar and .class files can help to prevent Java from being used by untrusted sources. Filtering requests that contain a Java User-Agent header may also be effective. For example, this technique can be used in environments where Java is required on the local intranet. The proxy can be configured to allow Java requests locally, but block them when the destination is a site on the internet. |
