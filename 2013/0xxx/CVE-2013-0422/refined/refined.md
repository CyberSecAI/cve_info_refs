  "CVE-2013-0422": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is due to improper permission checks in the MethodHandles.Lookup class of OpenJDK. This allows an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions and achieve arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper permission checks in MethodHandles.Lookup class",
       "Abuse of MBeanInstantiator.findClass to load arbitrary restricted classes",
      "Insecure use of invokeWithArguments method of java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle class, resulting in improper security checks."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Java plug-in process by enticing a user to load a malicious Java applet or JNLP file. This can lead to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote, unauthenticated exploitation via a malicious website containing a specially crafted Java applet. Drive-by downloads by compromising legitimate websites.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to host a malicious Java applet on a website. No user interaction is required beyond visiting the malicious page.",
        "additional_details": [
          "Exploits this vulnerability were seen in the wild and were incorporated into exploit kits like Blackhole, Nuclear Pack, Cool EK, RedKit, and Sweet Orange.",
          "The vulnerability can be triggered through web browsers with the Java plugin enabled, Java Web Start, or the Java Deployment Toolkit plugin.",
          "The vulnerability can be exploited in all versions of Java 7 prior to Update 11.",
          "The vulnerability stems from insecure implementation of Reflection API.",
          "The exploit is a combination of two vulnerabilities: a flaw that allows loading restricted classes using findClass and a second vulnerability that abuses the new Reflection API to obtain and call MethodHandle objects of restricted classes.",
          "Oracle's fix for CVE-2013-0422 in Java 7 Update 11 addresses the issue in the reflection API but does not fully prevent sandboxed code from gaining reference to restricted classes using MBeanInstantiator.findClass",
            "OpenJDK 7 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are not affected by the published exploit, but contain the underlying issue in the reflection API and is fixed to ensure it can not be exploited using some other way",
              "The vulnerability affects JBoss middleware products relying on the Java security manager to control privileges of deployed applications."
