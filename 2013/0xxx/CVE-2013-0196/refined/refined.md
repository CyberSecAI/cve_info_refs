Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The OpenShift web console uses basic authentication.
- The REST API lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The absence of CSRF protection in the REST API allows attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Basic Authentication:** Reliance on basic authentication for the web console makes it easier to extract authentication headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Actions:** Malicious links or scripts can be used to trigger unwanted actions against the REST API while a user is authenticated. This means an attacker can perform actions as the authenticated user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Links:** Attackers can embed malicious links in websites or emails.
- **Malicious Scripts:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into websites or other locations viewed by authenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link.
- The attacker does not need to have direct access to the OpenShift system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both OpenShift Enterprise and OpenShift Online.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jeremy Choi of the Red Hat Hosted and Shared Services team.
- The issue was addressed in the errata RHEA-2013-1031.
