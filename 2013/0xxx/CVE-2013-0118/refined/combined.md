## CS-Cart v3.0.4 configured with PayPal Standard Payments design vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#583564

Original Release Date: 2013-02-22 | Last Revised: 2013-02-22

---

### Overview

CS-Cart v3.0.4 and possibly other versions configured with PayPal Standard Payment is susceptible to a client-side attack that results in an attacker purchasing items without having to pay for them.

### Description

| It has been reported that CS-Cart v3.0.4 configured with PayPal Standard Payments contains a design flaw that allows an attacker to buy items without having to pay for them. The parameter for the merchant's PayPal email address is controlled on the client-side and not verified by the server. This allows an attacker to change the PayPal email address to one the attacker controls allowing the attacker to purchase items on a website but effectively pay themselves instead of the merchant. Manual verification of website orders with the PayPal transactions would need to be performed to detect this fraud. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can effectively purchase items without paying the merchant for them. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**  The vendor has stated that this vulnerability has been addressed in CS-Cart version 3.0.6. They have also released the security patch for the older versions (3.0.x & 2.2.x). |
