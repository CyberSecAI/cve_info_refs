The provided content is related to CVE-2013-0118.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a design flaw in CS-Cart when configured with PayPal Standard Payments. The merchant's PayPal email address parameter is controlled on the client-side and not verified by the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Client-side parameter manipulation.
- Lack of server-side verification of the merchant's PayPal email address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can purchase items without paying the merchant. Instead, the payment would be directed to the attacker's PayPal account.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is client-side. An attacker can manipulate the PayPal email address parameter before submitting the payment request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify the client-side parameter for the merchant's PayPal email address before the payment is processed. They would need to be able to manipulate the payment request.
