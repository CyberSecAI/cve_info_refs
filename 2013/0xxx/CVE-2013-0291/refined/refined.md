- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress discloses full server paths through XML/JSON responses. This occurs because the plugin includes server paths in the data it generates for these formats.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Full path disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information about the server's directory structure, potentially aiding in further attacks by revealing locations of critical files.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending crafted HTTP requests to the WordPress site, specifically targeting the plugin's API endpoints which return XML or JSON, an attacker can trigger the disclosure of server paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable WordPress installation. No authentication or special privileges are required, as the vulnerability is exposed publicly.
