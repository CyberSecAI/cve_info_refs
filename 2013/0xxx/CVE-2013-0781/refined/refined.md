Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0781:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the `nsPrintEngine::CommonPrint` function within Mozilla products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Use-after-free: Memory allocated for print job is freed prematurely, and then an attempt is made to use the freed memory, which causes a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Denial of service: Exploitation can lead to an application crash.
*   Potential Remote Code Execution: The advisory mentions that some of the issues discovered by Address Sanitizer are potentially exploitable for remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted web page that invokes the printing functionality.
*   The provided test case involves loading a page and then pressing Escape (likely canceling the print operation after initiating it).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to lure the user to visit a malicious page, or include malicious code in a website they visit.
*   The user needs to initiate a print job, or have a print operation invoked.
*   The vulnerability requires user interaction (user needs to initiate print)

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was found using Address Sanitizer.
* The vulnerability is present in Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird and Thunderbird ESR.
* The fix involves modifying how the `nsPrintEngine` object is handled during the printing process to prevent use-after-free.
* The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" because of the requirement for user interaction, but "critical" because it can cause crashes and potentially remote code execution.
*   The Ubuntu advisory mentions that the issue was fixed in Firefox 19.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1, 19.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1, etc.
*   The openSUSE advisory also notes the fix was included in Firefox 19.
*   The bug report on Bugzilla shows the fix involved a patch to `nsPrintEngine.cpp`
