- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
-   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities on the vulnerable website.
-   **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious scripts into user input fields within the Manager Change for Organic Groups module.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to insert malicious code into the relevant input fields, possibly via compromised user accounts.
