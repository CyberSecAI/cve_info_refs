##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

ICS Advisory
# Schneider Electric Serial Modbus Driver Buffer Overflow

Last RevisedSeptember 06, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-14-086-01

## OVERVIEW

Carsten Eiram of Risk-Based Security has identified a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Schneider Electric’s Serial Modbus Driver that affects 11 Schneider Electric products. Schneider Electric has produced patches that mitigate this vulnerability.

This vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Schneider Electric products bundle the Schneider Electric Modbus Serial Driver (ModbusDrv.exe), which is started when attempting to connect to a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) via the serial port of a personal computer:

* TwidoSuite Versions 2.31.04 and earlier,
* PowerSuite Versions 2.6 and earlier,
* SoMove Versions 1.7 and earlier,
* SoMachine Versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.0 XS,
* Unity Pro Versions 7.0 and earlier,
* UnityLoader Versions 2.3 and earlier,
* Concept Versions 2.6 SR7 and earlier,
* ModbusCommDTM sl Versions 2.1.2 and earlier,
* PL7 Versions 4.5 SP5 and earlier,
* SFT2841 Versions 14, 13.1 and earlier, and
* OPC Factory Server Versions 3.50 and earlier.

Modbus Serial Driver versions that are affected:

* Windows XP 32 bit V1.10 IE v37,
* Windows Vista 32 bit V2.2 IE12,
* Windows 7 32 bit V2.2 IE12, and
* Windows 7 64 bit V3.2 IE12.

## IMPACT

A successful exploit of this vulnerability could cause a buffer overflow that could allow arbitrary code execution with user privileges.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Schneider Electric corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.

The affected products are mostly software-based utilities and engineering tools designed for programming and configuring process, machine, and general control applications. These applications rely on a common driver to communicate with PLCs. According to Schneider Electric, the affected software is deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste, and Transportation Systems. Schneider Electric estimates that these products are used primarily in China, United States, and Europe.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed March 27, 2014.

The Modbus Serial Driver creates a listener on Port 27700/TCP. When a connection is made, the Modbus Application Header is first read into a buffer. If a large buffer size is specified in this header, a stack-based buffer overflow results.

A second overflow problem can then be exploited by overwriting the return address, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the permission of the user running the software.

CVE-2013-0662NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0662, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed March 27, 2014.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

This vulnerability can be remotely exploited.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a high skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

## MITIGATION

Schneider Electric has released a security notification with further information on this vulnerability and how to mitigate it:

[http://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p\_Doc\_Ref=SEVD 2013-070-01](http://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD%202013-070-01)

Schneider Electric recommends that products that use this driver be updated with the latest version of software.

OFS V3.5 and Unity Pro V8 have been released including the updated ModbusDriverSuite. For other products listed, the updated ModbusDriverSuite will be implemented with each new version of those software products.

Schneider Electric has no immediate plan for updating the other identified software products. For customers concerned about the Modbus Serial Driver used for those applications, please contact Schneider Electric Technical Support at:

<http://www2.schneider-electric.com/sites/corporate/en/products-services/services/field-services/services-by-business-activity/automation/lifecycle/technical-support.page>.

Until this software can be updated in the vulnerable devices, Schneider Electric recommends a defense-in-depth strategy, which includes locating the PLCs and devices running the vulnerable software behind firewalls configured to limit access to authorized personnel and protocols.

ICS‑CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B—Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
