| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c0)  Michael S.    2013-01-12 22:55:31 UTC  ``` It seems that redis 2.4 use a predictible file name in /tmp/ as some kind of swap file :      server.vm_swap_file = zstrdup("/tmp/redis-%p.vm");  this was removed in 2.6 ( deprecated code ), but 2.4 is in fedora 18 and epel 6 AFAIK.  Since redis do not care if the file exist or not before opening it ( and in fact, I think it try to reuse if it already exist ), this could be used by a attacker to erase a arbitrary file with a symlink to the file. Depending if redis is running as root or not, this could be dangerous, or just a minor nuisance.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 14:43:55 UTC  ``` Thank you for this report, Michael. I am going to steal this bug to be a security response product (as there are more products affected by this issue than just upcoming Fedora-18).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 14:50:58 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the redis package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16 and 17.  --  This issue affects the versions of the redis package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 and Fedora EPEL 6.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:46:32 UTC  ``` The upstream patch which fixed the "/tmp/redis-%p.vm" insecure flaw (but also introduced different one in "/tmp/redis.ds") is the following one:   <https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/697af434fbeb2e3ba2ba9687cd283ed1a2734fa5>  So to fix this issue it would be easier to rebase to latest 2.6.* version, which doesn't contain the issue any more.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:48:23 UTC  ``` Michael, since there is an upstream patch for this issue available already (latest 2.6.* version is not affected by this problem), would you mind if we would open this bug and request CVE identifier for it publicly?  Let us know. Thank you, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c5)  Michael S.    2013-01-14 15:53:23 UTC  ``` No problem for me.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:54:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c5)) > No problem for me.  Thank you. Will request CVE id shortly.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:58:39 UTC  ``` Created redis tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 895120](show_bug.cgi?id=895120 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - redis 2.4: Insecure temporary flaw use for redis service's vm swap file [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 895121](show_bug.cgi?id=895121 "CLOSED ERRATA - redis 2.4: Insecure temporary flaw use for redis service's vm swap file [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 16:11:42 UTC  ``` CVE request: [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/14/3>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c9)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-15 16:51:05 UTC  ``` Two CVEs were assigned here:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/14/7>  [CVE-2013-0178](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0178) for the insecure /tmp usage in 2.4 [CVE-2013-0180](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0180) for the insecure /tmp usage in 2.6  Since we only ship 2.4-based versions, only noting the first CVE as applicable to us in this bug.   ``` |  |
