# Security Bulletin: Security Vulnerabilites fixed in IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.0.2

### Flashes (Alerts)

## Abstract

Cross reference list for security vulnerabilities fixed in IBM WebSphere Application Server Fix Pack 8.5.0.2

## Content

**VULNERABILITY DETAILS:**

**CVE ID:** **CVE-2013-0458 (PM71139)** WebSphere Application Server could allow a cross-site scripting attack, caused by improper validation of input in the Administrative console. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to inject script into a victim’s Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site. This does not occur if Global security is enabled.  **CVSS:**  *CVSS Base Score: 4.3
