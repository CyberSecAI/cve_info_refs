| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-04 19:16:50 UTC  ``` A flaw in how TLS/DTLS, when CBC-mode encryption is used, communicates was reported.  This vulnerability can allow for a Man-in-the-Middle attacker to recover plaintext from a TLS/DTLS connection, when CBC-mode encryption is used.  This flaw is in the TLS specification, and not a bug in a specific implementation (as such, it affects nearly all implementations).  As such, it affects all TLS and DTLS implementations that are compliant with TLS 1.1 or 1.2, or with DTLS 1.0 or 1.2.  It also applies to implementations of SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 that incorporate countermeasures to deal with previous padding oracle attacks.  All TLS/DTLS ciphersuites that include CBC-mode encryption are potentially vulnerable.  The paper indicates that with OpenSSL, a full plaintext recovery attack is possible, and with GnuTLS, a partial plaintext recovery is possible (recovering up to 4 bits of the last byte in any block of plaintext).  To perform a successful attack, when TLS is used, a large number of TLS sessions are required (target plaintext must be sent repeatedly in the same position in the plaintext stream across the sessions).  For DTLS, a successful attack can be carried out in a single session.  The attacker must also be located close to the machine being attacked.  Further details are noted in the paper.  Current status of fixes in various implementations:  * OpenSSL has a patch in development * NSS has a patch in development * GnuTLS is fixed in versions 2.12.23, 3.0.28, and 3.1.7 * PolarSSL is fixed in version 1.2.5 * BouncyCastle has a patch that will be included in the forthcoming 1.48 version  Full paper:  <http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf>  External References:  <http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/> <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20130205.txt> <https://polarssl.org/tech-updates/releases/polarssl-1.2.5-released>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-05 07:12:06 UTC  ``` GnuTLS advisory GNUTLS-SA-2013-1:  <http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2013-1>  GnuTLS fix:  2.12.x: <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/458c67cf98740e7b12404f6c30e0d5317d56fd30> <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/93b7fcfa3297a9123630704668b2946f602b910e>  3.0.x: <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/8dc2822966f64dd9cf7dde9c7aacd80d49d3ffe5>  3.2.x / master: <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/328ee22c1b3951e060c7124c7cb1cee592c59bc0>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c2)  Huzaifa S.

Namely, we are stuck with version 1.46 because the later version (1.47) comes with backward incompatible API changes. This affects the dependent libraries, in particular itext. Unfortunately we are also stuck with itext-2.1.7 because the next version series (itext-5.*) was vetoed by FE-Legal.   Note that I do not maintain bouncycastle any more. I dropped my maintainership last August after an announcement in the Fedora-devel mailing list. To my knowledge no one picked it up yet, which makes me wonder why this bug CCd me. I can still provide some help though if you can supply a patch. If you provide a patch for bouncycastle-1.46 we can get around this problem.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c8)  Huzaifa S.

I read (parts of) the paper, and from what I understand, a successful attack does not seem to be realistically probable. The paper itself regards this as "only a theoretical threat".  I really do not think this is vital. Well, that's just me.   The attention this bug received just made me curious. The fact that there are so many parts of Fedora that need more love and manpower made me question the rationale behind distributing the resources.

RHSA-2013:0783 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2013-05-01
Updated:
2013-05-01
# RHSA-2013:0783 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for the OpenSSL component for JBoss Enterprise Application
Platform 5.2.0 for Solaris and Microsoft Windows that fixes two security
issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the OCSP response verification
in OpenSSL. A malicious OCSP server could use this flaw to crash
applications performing OCSP verification by sending a specially-crafted
response. (CVE-2013-0166)

It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting
TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
padding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
and configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 for Solaris and
Microsoft Windows as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised
to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

JBoss server instances configured to use the Tomcat Native library must be
restarted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

* JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Text-Only Advisories x86\_64

# CVE-2014-0195

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-0191.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-0196.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-0195 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0195)

#### Description

The dtls1\_reassemble\_fragment function in d1\_both.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly validate fragment lengths in DTLS ClientHello messages, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) via a long non-initial fragment.

### [SUSE information](https://www.suse.com/c/cve-pages-self-help-security-issues-suse-linux-enterprise/)

Overall state of this security issue: Resolved

This issue is currently rated as having [moderate](https://www.suse.com/support/security/rating/) severity.

[CVSS v2 Scores](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm)
|  | National Vulnerability Database |
| Base Score | 6.8 |
| Vector | AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P |
| Access Vector | Network |
| Access Complexity | Medium |
| Authentication | None |
| Confidentiality Impact | Partial |
| Integrity Impact | Partial |
| Availability Impact | Partial |

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

According to our research, openssl before 0.9.8o is not affected by this overflow problem. The DTLS fragment reassembly was rewritten for 0.9.8o and older versions used different methods. So openssl 0.9.8j as used by SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 and older versions are not affected. Please also not that this problem only affects the Datagram TLS (over UDP) not the regular TLS over TCP which is more common.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [880891](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=880891) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [885777](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=885777) [RESOLVED / INVALID], [915913](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=915913) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated openssl packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting
TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
padding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the OCSP response verification
in OpenSSL. A malicious OCSP server could use this flaw to crash
applications performing OCSP verification by sending a specially-crafted
response. (CVE-2013-0166)

It was discovered that the TLS/SSL protocol could leak information about
plain text when optional compression was used. An attacker able to control
part of the plain text sent over an encrypted TLS/SSL connection could
possibly use this flaw to recover other portions of the plain text.
(CVE-2012-4929)

Note: This update disables zlib compression, which was previously enabled
in OpenSSL by default. Applications using OpenSSL now need to explicitly
enable zlib compression to use it.

It was found that OpenSSL read certain environment variables even when used
by a privileged (setuid or setgid) application. A local attacker could use
this flaw to escalate their privileges. No application shipped with Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 was affected by this problem. (BZ#839735)

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues. For the update to take effect,
all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the
system rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Package        : openssl
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-0166 CVE-2013-0169
Debian Bug     : 699889

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2013-0166

    OpenSSL does not properly perform signature verification for OCSP
    responses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service via an invalid key.

CVE-2013-0169

    A timing side channel attack has been found in CBC padding
    allowing an attacker to recover pieces of plaintext via statistical
    analysis of crafted packages, known as the "Lucky Thirteen" issue.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze14.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

An update that fixes 37 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for libopenssl0\_9\_8 fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files or application command line arguments. If
user developed applications generated config file data based on
untrusted data, then this could have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- The package was updated to 0.9.8zh:
\* fixes many security vulnerabilities (not seperately listed):
CVE-2015-3195, CVE-2015-1788, CVE-2015-1789, CVE-2015-1790,
CVE-2015-1792, CVE-2015-1791, CVE-2015-0286, CVE-2015-0287,
CVE-2015-0289, CVE-2015-0293, CVE-2015-0209, CVE-2015-0288,
CVE-2014-3571, CVE-2014-3569, CVE-2014-3572, CVE-2015-0204,
CVE-2014-8275, CVE-2014-3570, CVE-2014-3567, CVE-2014-3568,
CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-3510, CVE-2014-3507, CVE-2014-3506,
CVE-2014-3505, CVE-2014-3508, CVE-2014-0224, CVE-2014-0221,
CVE-2014-0195, CVE-2014-3470, CVE-2014-0076, CVE-2013-0169,
CVE-2013-0166
- avoid running OPENSSL\_config twice. This avoids breaking engine loading.
(boo#952871, boo#967787)
- fix CVE-2015-3197 (boo#963415)
\* SSLv2 doesn't block disabled ciphers

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2013:0833 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2013:0833 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0, which fixes multiple security
issues, various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red
Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications
based on JBoss Application Server 7.

This release serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application
Platform 6.0.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the 6.1.0
Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes,
available shortly from <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/>

Security fixes:

XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. (CVE-2012-5575)

Note: Automatic checks to prevent CVE-2012-5575 are only run when
WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security requirements. It is best
practice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce security requirements.

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the OCSP response verification
in OpenSSL. A malicious OCSP server could use this flaw to crash
applications performing OCSP verification by sending a specially-crafted
response. (CVE-2013-0166)

It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting
TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
padding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)

When applications running on JBoss Web used the COOKIE session tracking
method, the org.apache.catalina.connector.Response.encodeURL() method
returned the URL with the jsessionid appended as a query string parameter
when processing the first request of a session. An attacker could possibly
exploit this flaw by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to obtain a
user's jsessionid and hijack their session, or by extracting the jsessionid
from log files. Note that no session tracking method is used by default,
one must be configured. (CVE-2012-4529)

If multiple applications used the same custom authorization module class
name, and provided their own implementations of it, the first application
to be loaded will have its implementation used for all other applications
using the same custom authorization module class name. A local attacker
could use this flaw to deploy a malicious application that provides
implementations of custom authorization modules that permit or deny user
access according to rules supplied by the attacker. (CVE-2012-4572)

The GUI installer created a world-readable auto-install XML file containing
both the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform administrator password and
the sucker password for the selected messaging system in plain text. A
local user able to access the directory where the GUI installer was run
could use this flaw to gain administrative access to the JBoss Enterprise
Application Platform instance. (CVE-2013-0218)

Red Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj
Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575.
CVE-2012-4572 was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss EAP
Quality Engineering team, and CVE-2013-0218 was discovered by Arun
Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

Users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 as provided from the
Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise
Application Platform 6.1.0.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying this update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed
applications.

# CVE-2013-0169

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2013-0166.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2013-0170.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2013-0169 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0169)

#### Description

The TLS protocol 1.1 and 1.2 and the DTLS protocol 1.0 and 1.2, as used in OpenSSL, OpenJDK, PolarSSL, and other products, do not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check requirement during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, aka the "Lucky Thirteen" issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

An update that contains security fixes can now be installed.
Description:
OpenSSL has been updated to fix various security issues:
\*
CVE-2014-3568: The build option no-ssl3 was incomplete.
\*
CVE-2014-3566: Support for TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV was added.
\*
CVE-2014-3508: An information leak in pretty printing functions was
fixed.
\*
CVE-2013-0166: A OCSP bad key DoS attack was fixed.
\*
CVE-2013-0169: An SSL/TLS CBC plaintext recovery attack was fixed.
\*
CVE-2014-3470: Anonymous ECDH denial of service was fixed.
\*
CVE-2014-0224: A SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability was fixed.
\*
CVE-2014-3570: Bignum squaring (BN\_sqr) may have produced incorrect
results on some platforms, including x86\_64.
\*
CVE-2014-3572: Don't accept a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH
ciphersuites with the server key exchange message omitted.
\*
CVE-2014-8275: Fixed various certificate fingerprint issues.
\*
CVE-2015-0204: Only allow ephemeral RSA keys in export ciphersuites
\*
CVE-2015-0205: A fix was added to prevent use of DH client
certificates without sending certificate verify message.
\*
CVE-2015-0286: A segmentation fault in ASN1\_TYPE\_cmp was fixed that
could be exploited by attackers when e.g. client authentication is used.
This could be exploited over SSL connections.
\*
CVE-2015-0287: A ASN.1 structure reuse memory corruption was fixed.
This problem can not be exploited over regular SSL connections, only if
specific client programs use specific ASN.1 routines.
\*
CVE-2015-0288: A X509\_to\_X509\_REQ NULL pointer dereference was
fixed, which could lead to crashes. This function is not commonly used,
and not reachable over SSL methods.
\*
CVE-2015-0289: Several PKCS7 NULL pointer dereferences were fixed,
which could lead to crashes of programs using the PKCS7 APIs. The SSL apis
do not use those by default.
\*
CVE-2015-0292: Various issues in base64 decoding were fixed, which
could lead to crashes with memory corruption, for instance by using
attacker supplied PEM data.
\*
CVE-2015-0293: Denial of service via reachable assert in SSLv2
servers, could be used by remote attackers to terminate the server
process. Note that this requires SSLv2 being allowed, which is not the
default.
