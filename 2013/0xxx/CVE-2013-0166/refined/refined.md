Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-0166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an improper signature verification process in OpenSSL when handling OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) responses. This flaw arises from a lack of proper validation, specifically a NULL pointer dereference, which leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Signature Verification:** OpenSSL does not correctly verify signatures of OCSP responses, leading to a vulnerability.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is a NULL pointer dereference that occurs during OCSP response verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted OCSP response with an invalid key. This crash can impact applications performing OCSP validation.
*   **Application Crash:** The vulnerability leads to a crash of applications performing OCSP validation.
*  **Unauthorized disclosure of information and unauthorized modification** Due to the use of older versions of Openssl that also contain vulnerabilities such as CVE-2012-2333. 

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote OCSP Server:** The attack vector involves a malicious OCSP server sending a crafted response to vulnerable clients.
*  **Network-based attack:** The attack vector is network, allowing a remote attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Local access:** in the case of an application using the library, a local user could manipulate the application and cause it to perform malicious actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send responses to a system performing OCSP validation. The attacker must have control of the OCSP server.
*   **Malicious OCSP Server:**  The attacker needs to operate or control an OCSP server.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects OpenSSL versions before 0.9.8y, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0k, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1d.
*   The issue was addressed by implementing proper checks for valid key during the OCSP verification process, and by updating OpenSSL to version 0.9.8y, 1.0.0k, and 1.0.1d respectively.
*   The flaw is also exploitable in libraries such as libopenssl, Java OpenJDK, and jboss packages.
*   This vulnerability was often fixed alongside CVE-2013-0169 and other related vulnerabilities.
*  The fix for the vulnerability involves updating Openssl to a non-vulnerable version. Some vendors choose to disable certain vulnerable features such as SSLv2 support and EXPORT ciphers as part of the fix.
*  A successful attack does not seem to be realistically probable and it is considered only a theoretical threat by some vendors.
