  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2013-0335": {
      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The VNC proxy in OpenStack Nova does not properly validate VNC tokens after an instance is deleted.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Insufficient token validation",
          "Reusing of VNC ports by libvirt"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker with a valid VNC token for a deleted VM can potentially gain access to the VNC console of a newly created VM if the same VNC port gets reused. This could allow unauthorized access to another user's virtual machine, but not bypass the normal user name and password authentication on the virtual machine itself.",
        "attack_vector": "A user with a previously issued, valid VNC token for a deleted VM attempts to connect to the VNC console.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a valid OpenStack user, have requested a VNC console token and deleted the VM to trigger the vulnerability and then a new VM has to be spawned on the same host reusing the same port."
      }
    }
