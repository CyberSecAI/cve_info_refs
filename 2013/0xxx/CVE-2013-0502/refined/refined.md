**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the injection of malicious script in the Logging View within the Information Server Web Console which would then be executed when a user views the log.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to find a way to insert the malicious script which will be rendered in the vulnerable Logging View of the InfoSphere Information Server Web Console. The specific insertion point is not disclosed in the provided content. The attacker does not appear to require any special privileges within the IBM InfoSphere application.
