      "source": "docs.microsoft.com_3293bef3_20250125_220103.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) parses XML content, which can corrupt the system state in such a way as to allow an attacker to run arbitrary code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Truncation in XML parsing"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By hosting a specially crafted website that is designed to invoke MSXML through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements.",
          "Non-Microsoft web applications and services that utilize the MSXML library for parsing XML could also be vulnerable to this attack."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's website."
