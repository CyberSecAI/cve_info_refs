{
  "CVE-2013-0013": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Windows fails to properly handle SSL/TLS session version negotiation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of SSL/TLS session version negotiation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could silently downgrade an SSL version 3 or TLS connection to SSL version 2, which supports weak encryption ciphers. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the supposedly secure connection.",
    "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where an attacker injects malformed traffic into an SSL/TLS browsing session.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between the client and the server. They need to inject specially crafted content into an SSL/TLS session.",
      "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is a security feature bypass that could bypass security features in SSL version 3 or TLS that mitigate against a connection being downgraded to SSL version 2.\n\nWorkarounds include configuring Internet Explorer and IIS to disable SSLv2, but it may break functionality of systems that still use SSLv2"
