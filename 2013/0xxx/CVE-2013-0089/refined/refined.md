Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in Internet Explorer's `CMarkupBehaviorContext` object. This means the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The core issue is that Internet Explorer attempts to access a `CMarkupBehaviorContext` object after it has been deleted from memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- System Compromise: Attackers can potentially take complete control of an affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based Attack: The primary attack vector involves a user visiting a specially crafted webpage using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- Compromised Websites: Attackers can exploit compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content to inject malicious code designed to exploit this vulnerability.
- Social Engineering: The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious site, typically through links in emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote: An attacker can be remote and does not require local access to the system.
- Ability to Host Malicious Content: The attacker needs to host a website or inject malicious code into an existing website.
- Social Engineering Skills: The attacker must be able to convince a user to visit the malicious site.
