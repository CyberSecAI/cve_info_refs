# Security Flaws in Universal Plug and Play: Unplug, Don't Play

* Jan 29, 2013
* 3 min read
* [HD Moore](/blog/author/hd-moore/)

*Last updated at Tue, 03 Sep 2024 20:46:00 GMT*

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/post-images/14058/stats.png#img-half-right)

This morning we released a whitepaper entitled [Security Flaws in Universal Plug and Play](https://information.rapid7.com/rs/411-NAK-970/images/SecurityFlawsUPnP%20%281%29.pdf). This paper is the result of a research project spanning the second half of 2012 that measured the global exposure of UPnP-enabled network devices. The results were shocking to the say the least. Over 80 million unique IPs were identified that responded to UPnP discovery requests from the internet. Somewhere between 40 and 50 million IPs are vulnerable to at least one of three attacks outlined in this paper. The two most commonly used UPnP software libraries both contained remotely exploitable vulnerabilities. In the case of the [Portable UPnP SDK](http://pupnp.sourceforge.net/), over 23 million IPs are vulnerable to remote code execution through a single UDP packet. All told, we were able to identify over 6,900 product versions that were vulnerable through UPnP. This list encompasses over 1,500 vendors and only took into account devices that exposed the UPnP SOAP service to the internet, a serious vulnerability in of itself.

The vulnerabilities we identified in the Portable UPnP SDK have been fixed as of version 1.6.18 (released today), but it will take a long time before each of the application and device vendors incorporate this patch into their products. In most cases, network equipment that is "no longer shipping" will not be updated at all, exposing these users to remote compromise until UPnP is disabled or the product is swapped for something new. The flaws identified in the [MiniUPnP](http://miniupnp.free.fr/) software were fixed over two years ago, yet over 330 products are still using older versions.

For the reasons outlined above, we strongly suggest that end users, companies, and ISPs take immediate action to identify and disable any internet-exposed UPnP endpoints in their environments. UPnP is pervasive - it is enabled by default on many home gateways, nearly all network printers, and devices ranging from IP cameras to network storage servers.

To this end, we have provided [ScanNow UPnP](http://www.rapid7.com/resources/free-security-software-downloads/universal-plug-and-play-jan-2013.jsp), a free tool that can identify exposed UPnP endpoints in your network and flag which of those may remotely exploitable through recently discovered vulnerabilities. A screenshot of this tool in action in the lower right.

If you are accessing the internet from your home network, we now offer an alternative to ScanNow and Metasploit. The [Rapid7 UPnP Check](http://upnp-check.rapid7.com/) is a one-click security scan for broadband and mobile users. If you are concerned about the security of your non-technical friends and family, this is a quick way for them to check their home router for UPnP vulnerabilities. The main difference between this service and ScanNow is that the UPnP Check will run a scan from the internet and can only check the external interface of your router.

Although ScanNow only supports Microsoft Windows, users of Mac OS X and Linux can accomplish the same task using [Metasploit.](http://www.rapid7.com/downloads/metasploit.jsp) To use the latest module,which includes vulnerability reporting for the recently disclosed vulnerabilities, make sure you have the most current update applied.

Using this module within Metasploit's web interface is simple. Create a new project and access the Modules tab. In the search bar, enter "ssdp\_msearch", then select the module named **UPnP SSDP M-SEARCH Information Discovery**. Enter the network range you want to scan and Metasploit will take care of the rest. The module will run in the background and the Analysis tab will be updated with hosts and vulnerabilities as they are found.

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/post-images/14058/scannow.png#img-half-right)

To accomplish the same task using the command-line, first open the Metasploit console.

```
$ msfconsole
msf>

```

From the msf prompt, enter the following commands, substituting your own network for RHOSTS

```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/upnp/ssdp_msearch

msfÂ  auxiliary(ssdp_msearch) > set RHOSTS 192.168.0.0/24

msfÂ  auxiliary(ssdp_msearch) > run

```

Any devices supporting UPnP should appear, with specific CVEs listed for those that have at least one exploitable vulnerability.

```
[*] 192.168.0.9:1900 SSDP Net-OS 5.xx UPnP/1.0 | http://192.168.0.9:3278/etc/linuxigd/gatedesc.xml
[+] 192.168.0.254:1900 SSDP miniupnpd/1.0 UPnP/1.0 | vulns:2 (CVE-2013-0229, CVE-2013-0230)

[ ] 192.168.0.254:1900 SSDP miniupnpd/1.0 UPnP/1.0vulns:2 (CVE-2013-0229, CVE-2013-0230)

```

If you are interested in hearing more about these issues, I will be hosting a [one-hour webcast on February 4th at 3:00pm EST](http://information.rapid7.com/Webcast-UPnP-Registration.html?LS=1677495%20&CS=blog).Â  You can also leave comments on this post.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
