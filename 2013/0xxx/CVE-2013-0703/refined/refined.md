Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0703:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the imgboard software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS): The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's web browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of web pages
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a network attack vector, likely by injecting malicious code through the user-provided input, which is not sanitized, and is then displayed to other users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't need any authentication (None) for successful exploitation.
- The complexity of the attack is medium, suggesting some degree of effort is needed, possibly to craft the malicious script or find a specific injection point.
