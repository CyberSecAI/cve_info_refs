  "CVE-2013-0003": {
    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that a System.DirectoryServices.Protocols (S.DS.P) namespace method in the .NET Framework validates the size of objects in memory prior to copying those objects into an array. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the .NET Framework improperly validating the size of objects in memory before copying them into an array within the System.DirectoryServices.Protocols (S.DS.P) namespace.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Insufficient Array Size Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a complete takeover of the affected system, enabling the attacker to install software, modify data, and create new accounts with administrative privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web browsing via a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) on a website or compromised website",
      "Windows .NET application using the vulnerability to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host or inject a malicious XBAP, or run a malicious .NET application. The user must also interact by visiting the malicious webpage or executing the malicious .NET application.",
    "additional_information": "The System.DirectoryServices.Protocols (S.DS.P) namespace is used to bring LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) programming capabilities to managed code developers."
