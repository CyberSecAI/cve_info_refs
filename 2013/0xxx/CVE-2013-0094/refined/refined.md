Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in the `removeChild` function within Internet Explorer. This means the browser attempts to access a memory location that has already been freed, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability, where a program tries to access memory that has been released. This is a classic memory management error.
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability can corrupt memory, which an attacker can leverage to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the current user, which can lead to complete control of the system if the user has administrative rights.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites, or websites that host user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to convince users to visit a malicious link, or open a malicious email attachment containing the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** The attacker can be remote since the attack can be carried out through a website.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to convince the user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
- **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific exploit to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability and execute code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, 9 and 10).
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Internet Explorer on Windows client operating systems and "Moderate" for server operating systems.
- The vulnerability is one of several use-after-free vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-021.

**Mitigation and Workarounds (from the source):**
- Set Internet and Local Intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting
- Add trusted sites to the Internet Explorer Trusted Sites zone to avoid blocking functionality for legitimate sites.
- Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable it in the Internet and Local Intranet security zones
