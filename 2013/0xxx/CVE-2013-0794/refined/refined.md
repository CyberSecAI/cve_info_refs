Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-0794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how tab-modal dialog boxes are handled in combination with browser navigation. Specifically, the `DOMWillOpenModalDialog` event could be exploited when combined with navigation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of origin indication:** Attackers could remove the origin indication on tab-modal dialogs. This means that the dialog box would not clearly show which website it originated from.
- **Spoofing:**  An attacker's dialog could overlay a page and show another site's content.
- **Phishing:** Users could be tricked into entering data into a modal prompt dialog on an attacking site, while believing it to be from the displayed, legitimate site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can create convincing fake dialogs that mimic those from legitimate websites, leading users to unknowingly enter sensitive information.
- **Data Theft:** Stolen credentials, personal data, and other sensitive information could result.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious webpage triggers the `DOMWillOpenModalDialog` event.
- Browser navigation is used to create the spoofing condition.
- The attacker overlays a fake modal dialog on top of a legitimate page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and host malicious web pages.
- The user must visit the attacker's malicious web page.
- The attacker must be able to craft a dialog that appears legitimate.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "shutdown".
- The fix for this vulnerability involved making the `DOMWillOpenModalDialog` event a chrome-only event. This means it is no longer available to content scripts and thus can't be exploited in the way described. This fix was implemented in Bug 611553.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 20 and SeaMonkey 2.17.
- Patches were also prepared for Aurora 20.
