| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-01 16:23:28 UTC  ``` Apache Maven 3.0.4 (with Apache Maven Wagon 2.1) has introduced a non-secure SSL mode by default. This mode disables all SSL certificate checking, including: host name verification , date validity, and certificate chain. Not validating the certificate introduces the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.  Version 3.0.5 corrects this flaw.   External References:  <https://maven.apache.org/security.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-01 16:24:56 UTC  ``` Created maven tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 917086](show_bug.cgi?id=917086 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-0253 maven: all SSL certificate checking is disabled by default [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c2)  Mikolaj Izdebski    2013-03-01 16:33:32 UTC  ``` As far as I know this does not affect any version Fedora. This is a bug in maven-wagon package, not maven. Fedora uses maven-wagon 1.0 which is unaffected by this vulnerability.  Please confirm if the above statement is true. I don't want to introduce needless major version bump (maven-wagon 1.0 to 2.4) in stable releases (such as Fedora 17 or Fedora 18).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 17:48:13 UTC  ``` It sounds as though it's a combination of Maven 3.0.4 and Maven Wagon 2.x but I can't be 100% sure (and as per your comment in the fedora tracking bug, I don't have a reproducer although I suspect if you pointed it a host with an invalid certificate you would know (or have the cert specified for host.com and point Maven to cname.com (cname for host.com) so that Maven is connecting to cname.com with a certificate specifying host.com) would be sufficient to check.  The bug was more to bump Maven to 3.0.5 (from 3.0.4) and not necessarily also bump Maven Wagon (as the flaw is noted as being introduced in 3.0.4, I suspect the flaw is more in Maven than Maven Wagon).  Bumping Maven to 3.0.5 across all versions of Fedora and leaving Maven Wagon untouched (keep it at 1.0) should be sufficient to correct this.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c4)  Mikolaj Izdebski    2013-03-07 06:30:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 706362](attachment.cgi?id=706362&action=diff "diff -u -r apache-maven-3.0.4 apache-maven-3.0.5") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=706362&action=edit "diff -u -r apache-maven-3.0.4 apache-maven-3.0.5") diff -u -r apache-maven-3.0.4 apache-maven-3.0.5  There is no code difference between Maven 3.0.4 and 3.0.5. I attached diff -r between maven 3.0.4 and 3.0.5 tarballs. The diff contains basically version bump from 3.0.4 to 3.0.5, documentation changes (which don't affect runtime) and changed maven-wagon dependency from 2.2 to 2.4. There is no direct fix for any security bug.  The vulnerability itself was present in maven-wagon 2.x < 2.4. In Fedora we never had such versions of maven-wagon. In Fedora 19 it was updated from 1.0 directly to 2.4, skipping all affected versions. Fedora 17 and 18 we still have version 1.0, which is unaffected.  (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c3)) > The bug was more to bump Maven to 3.0.5 (from 3.0.4) and not necessarily > also bump Maven Wagon (as the flaw is noted as being introduced in 3.0.4, I > suspect the flaw is more in Maven than Maven Wagon).  Bumping Maven to 3.0.5 > across all versions of Fedora and leaving Maven Wagon untouched (keep it at > 1.0) should be sufficient to correct this.  It's exactly the opposite. The bug is in Maven Wagon. It would be enough to update Maven Wagon, there is no need for updating Maven itself. (Combination of Maven 3.0.5 and Maven Wagon 2.2 is vulnerable, while Maven 3.0.4 and Maven Wagon 1.0 or 2.4 are not). The attached diff shows that there are no semantic changes in Maven 3.0.5.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c6)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-13 16:35:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c4)) ... > It's exactly the opposite. The bug is in Maven Wagon. It would be enough to > update Maven Wagon, there is no need for updating Maven itself. (Combination > of Maven 3.0.5 and Maven Wagon 2.2 is vulnerable, while Maven 3.0.4 and > Maven Wagon 1.0 or 2.4 are not). The attached diff shows that there are no > semantic changes in Maven 3.0.5.  Thanks for this.  I wish that upstream had been a bit clearer as to where the problem really was.  Thanks for taking the time to do this analysis.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c11)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2013-03-15 02:26:45 UTC  ``` This issue can be isolated to the (org.apache.maven.wagon, wagon-http-shared4) artifacts. All versions in (2.1,2.2,2.3) are vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-04-02 19:56:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEL 6 Version of OpenShift Enterprise  Via RHSA-2013:0700 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0700.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c18)  Kurt Seifried    2013-04-05 04:07:26 UTC  ``` This has been addressed in all products, CLOSEing as per SRT guidelines.   ``` |  |

# Maven Security

## Security Model

The purpose of Maven is to perform the actions defined in the supplied
`pom.xml`, which commonly includes compiling and running the associated
code and using plugins and dependencies downloaded from the configured
repositories.

As such, the Maven security model assumes you trust the `pom.xml` and
the code, dependencies and repositories that are used in your build.
If you want to use Maven to build untrusted code, it is up to you to
provide the required isolation.

## Security Vulnerabilities

Please note that binary patches are not produced for individual
vulnerabilities. To obtain the binary fix for a particular vulnerability
you should upgrade to an Apache Maven version where that vulnerability
has been fixed.

For more information about reporting vulnerabilities, see the [Apache
Security Team](https://www.apache.org/security/) page.

### CVE-2021-26291 Apache Maven 3.8.1

Severity: Medium

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* Apache Maven 3.6.3 and earlier

Description: More and more repositories use HTTPS nowadays, but this hasn't always been the case. This means that Maven Central contains POMs with custom repositories that refer to a URL over HTTP.
This makes downloads via such repository a target for a MITM attack.
At the same time, developers are probably not aware that for some downloads an insecure URL is being used.
Because uploaded POMs to Maven Central are immutable, a change for Maven was required.
To solve this, we extended the mirror configuration with `<blocked>` parameter,
and we added a new `external:http:*` mirror selector (like existing `external:*`), meaning “any external URL using HTTP”.

The decision was made to block such external HTTP repositories by default: this is done by providing a mirror in the `conf/settings.xml` blocking insecure HTTP external URLs.
Note: this is a vulnerability in case you're connectioning directly to remote repositories instead of using an artifact repository manager.

### Maven Dependency, EAR, Javadoc, WAR and Plugin Plugins

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* Maven Dependency Plugin 3.1.0 and earlier
* Maven EAR Plugin 3.0.0 and earlier
* Maven Javadoc Plugin 2.5 to 3.0.0
* Maven WAR Plugin 2.1-alpha-1 to 3.2.0
* Maven Plugin Plugin 3.0 to 3.5.1

Description: As part of a broader research, the Snyk Security Research Team discovered
an arbitrary file write generic vulnerability, that can be achieved using a
specially crafted zip (or bzip2, gzip, tar, xz, war) archive, that holds
path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the
target extraction directory, if the extraction tool used does not make
sufficient checks, the final path ends up outside of the target directory.
The affected plugins use plexus-archiver to unpack dependencies to disk
and have been identified as potential triggers for exposing the vulnerability
if dependencies are compromised.

See [full description](./security-plexus-archiver.html) for more details.

### CVE-2013-0253 Apache Maven 3.0.4

Severity: Medium

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* Apache Maven 3.0.4
* Apache Maven Wagon 2.1, 2.2, 2.3

Description: Apache Maven 3.0.4 (with Apache Maven Wagon 2.1) has
introduced a non-secure SSL mode by default. This mode disables all SSL
certificate checking, including: host name verification , date validity,
and certificate chain. Not validating the certificate introduces the
possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.

[CVE-2013-0253](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0253)

All users are recommended to upgrade to [Apache Maven
3.0.5](./download.cgi) and Apache Maven Wagon 2.4.

Credit: This issue was identified by Graham Leggett

### CVE-2012-6153 Apache Maven Wagon :: WebDAV Provider

Severity: Medium

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* Apache Maven Wagon WebDAV Provider 2.12 and earlier

Description: http/conn/ssl/AbstractVerifier.java in Apache Commons HttpClient
before 4.2.3 does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a
domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the
X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL
servers via a certificate with a subject that specifies a common name in a
field that is not the CN field.

[CVE-2012-6153](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6153)

Users of this provider are recommended to upgrade to [Apache Maven Wagon ::
WebDAV Provider 3.0.0](./download.cgi)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

An updated jenkins package that fixes one security issue is now available
for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-01 16:23:28 UTC  ``` Apache Maven 3.0.4 (with Apache Maven Wagon 2.1) has introduced a non-secure SSL mode by default. This mode disables all SSL certificate checking, including: host name verification , date validity, and certificate chain. Not validating the certificate introduces the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.  Version 3.0.5 corrects this flaw.   External References:  <https://maven.apache.org/security.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-01 16:24:56 UTC  ``` Created maven tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 917086](show_bug.cgi?id=917086 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-0253 maven: all SSL certificate checking is disabled by default [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c2)  Mikolaj Izdebski    2013-03-01 16:33:32 UTC  ``` As far as I know this does not affect any version Fedora. This is a bug in maven-wagon package, not maven. Fedora uses maven-wagon 1.0 which is unaffected by this vulnerability.  Please confirm if the above statement is true. I don't want to introduce needless major version bump (maven-wagon 1.0 to 2.4) in stable releases (such as Fedora 17 or Fedora 18).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 17:48:13 UTC  ``` It sounds as though it's a combination of Maven 3.0.4 and Maven Wagon 2.x but I can't be 100% sure (and as per your comment in the fedora tracking bug, I don't have a reproducer although I suspect if you pointed it a host with an invalid certificate you would know (or have the cert specified for host.com and point Maven to cname.com (cname for host.com) so that Maven is connecting to cname.com with a certificate specifying host.com) would be sufficient to check.  The bug was more to bump Maven to 3.0.5 (from 3.0.4) and not necessarily also bump Maven Wagon (as the flaw is noted as being introduced in 3.0.4, I suspect the flaw is more in Maven than Maven Wagon).  Bumping Maven to 3.0.5 across all versions of Fedora and leaving Maven Wagon untouched (keep it at 1.0) should be sufficient to correct this.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c4)  Mikolaj Izdebski    2013-03-07 06:30:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 706362](attachment.cgi?id=706362&action=diff "diff -u -r apache-maven-3.0.4 apache-maven-3.0.5") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=706362&action=edit "diff -u -r apache-maven-3.0.4 apache-maven-3.0.5") diff -u -r apache-maven-3.0.4 apache-maven-3.0.5  There is no code difference between Maven 3.0.4 and 3.0.5. I attached diff -r between maven 3.0.4 and 3.0.5 tarballs. The diff contains basically version bump from 3.0.4 to 3.0.5, documentation changes (which don't affect runtime) and changed maven-wagon dependency from 2.2 to 2.4. There is no direct fix for any security bug.  The vulnerability itself was present in maven-wagon 2.x < 2.4. In Fedora we never had such versions of maven-wagon. In Fedora 19 it was updated from 1.0 directly to 2.4, skipping all affected versions. Fedora 17 and 18 we still have version 1.0, which is unaffected.  (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c3)) > The bug was more to bump Maven to 3.0.5 (from 3.0.4) and not necessarily > also bump Maven Wagon (as the flaw is noted as being introduced in 3.0.4, I > suspect the flaw is more in Maven than Maven Wagon).  Bumping Maven to 3.0.5 > across all versions of Fedora and leaving Maven Wagon untouched (keep it at > 1.0) should be sufficient to correct this.  It's exactly the opposite. The bug is in Maven Wagon. It would be enough to update Maven Wagon, there is no need for updating Maven itself. (Combination of Maven 3.0.5 and Maven Wagon 2.2 is vulnerable, while Maven 3.0.4 and Maven Wagon 1.0 or 2.4 are not). The attached diff shows that there are no semantic changes in Maven 3.0.5.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c6)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-13 16:35:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c4)) ... > It's exactly the opposite. The bug is in Maven Wagon. It would be enough to > update Maven Wagon, there is no need for updating Maven itself. (Combination > of Maven 3.0.5 and Maven Wagon 2.2 is vulnerable, while Maven 3.0.4 and > Maven Wagon 1.0 or 2.4 are not). The attached diff shows that there are no > semantic changes in Maven 3.0.5.  Thanks for this.  I wish that upstream had been a bit clearer as to where the problem really was.  Thanks for taking the time to do this analysis.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c11)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2013-03-15 02:26:45 UTC  ``` This issue can be isolated to the (org.apache.maven.wagon, wagon-http-shared4) artifacts. All versions in (2.1,2.2,2.3) are vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-04-02 19:56:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEL 6 Version of OpenShift Enterprise  Via RHSA-2013:0700 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0700.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=917084#c18)  Kurt Seifried    2013-04-05 04:07:26 UTC  ``` This has been addressed in all products, CLOSEing as per SRT guidelines.   ``` |  |
