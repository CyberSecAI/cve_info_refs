Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the .NET Framework improperly elevating the permissions of a callback function when a specific WinForms object is created. This improper elevation allows for a privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Privilege Management:** The core weakness is the incorrect handling of permissions during the execution of user-provided callbacks within the .NET Framework when specific WinForms objects are created.
- **Code Access Security (CAS) Bypass:** The vulnerability can be used to bypass CAS restrictions, meaning that code not intended to have high privileges can achieve them through this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user, which can lead to full system control, depending on the user's privileges.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **System Compromise:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to take complete control of an affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Browsing:** An attacker can host a malicious website containing a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to convince the user to visit this website.
- **Windows .NET Applications:** Malicious Windows .NET applications can exploit this vulnerability to bypass CAS restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Web Browsing Scenario:**
  - The attacker needs to host or compromise a website to deliver the malicious XBAP.
  - The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website (e.g., through social engineering, malicious links in emails, etc.).
- **Windows .NET Applications Scenario:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious .NET application on the target system.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects .NET Framework versions 2.0 SP2, 3.5, 3.5.1, 4, and 4.5 on various Windows operating systems.
- The provided document also details mitigations and workarounds, such as disabling XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer.
- The document includes detailed steps for applying the security update via various deployment methods.
- The document identifies James Forshaw of Context Information Security as the reporter of this vulnerability.
