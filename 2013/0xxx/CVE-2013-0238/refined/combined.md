# CVE-2013-0238

| **Name** | CVE-2013-0238 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The try\_parse\_v4\_netmask function in hostmask.c in IRCD-Hybrid before 8.0.6 does not properly validate masks, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a mask that causes a negative number to be parsed. |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## MGASA-2013-0055

| **Date:** | February 16th, 2013 |
| --- | --- |
| **Affected releases:** | 2 |
| **Media:** | Core |

**Description:**

Updated ircd-hybrid packages fix security vulnerability:

Bob Nomnomnom reported a Denial of Service vulnerability in IRCD-Hybrid, an

Internet Relay Chat server. A remote attacker may use an error in the masks

validation and crash the server (CVE-2013-0238).

Please note that due to the previously suboptimal nature of the sysvinit

script, systemd systems would not correctly detect the daemon process as

running and thus could not stop the service. As a result, you may have to

manually kill the process and start the service after upgrading (i.e.

killall ircd-hybrid; systemctl start ircd-hybrid.service).

**Updated Packages:**

i586:

ircd-hybrid-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.i586.rpm

ircd-hybrid-devel-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.i586.rpm

ircd-hybrid-debug-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.i586.rpm

x86\_64:

ircd-hybrid-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.x86\_64.rpm

ircd-hybrid-devel-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.x86\_64.rpm

ircd-hybrid-debug-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.x86\_64.rpm

SRPMS:

ircd-hybrid-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.src.rpm

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: ircd-hybrid: Denial of service vulnerability in
hostmask.c:try\_parse\_v4\_netmask()
Date: Tue, 29 Jan 2013 17:38:36 +0200
```
Package: ircd-hybrid
Version: 1:7.2.2.dfsg.2-6.2
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Mr. Bob Nomnomnom from Torland reported a denial of service security
vulnerability in ircd-hybrid. Function hostmask.c:try_parse_v4_netmask() is
using strtoul to parse masks. Documentation says strtoul can parse "-number" as
well. Validation of input does not catch evil bits. I can give proof of concept
if needed.

Fixed in commit: <http://svn.ircd-hybrid.org:8000/viewcvs.cgi/ircd-hybrid/trunk/src/hostmask.c?r1=1786&r2=1785&pathrev=1786>
Fixed in: ircd-hybrid 8.0.6

I have requested CVE identifier for this vulnerability.

All Debian packages tested not to be affected by this issue. I wonder who made
these changes to Debian packages code as she/he did not report these issues to
upstream (or didn't know about the problem).

This source code change isn't in Debian, but we haven't worked out why
the problem isn't reproducible. Until this is understood, the bug should
remain open.

It might be useful to know this exists in the experimental version
however this is probably not surprising. I rebuilt my version with ssl
support using the debian rules

Hi security team.

I've fixed this in experimental and unstable, and the attached debdiff
fixes it for stable too. Please let me know if I may upload.

Cheers,

## MGASA-2013-0055

| **Date:** | February 16th, 2013 |

| **Affected releases:** | 2 |
| **Media:** | Core |

**Description:**

Updated ircd-hybrid packages fix security vulnerability:

Bob Nomnomnom reported a Denial of Service vulnerability in IRCD-Hybrid, an

Internet Relay Chat server. A remote attacker may use an error in the masks

validation and crash the server (CVE-2013-0238).

Please note that due to the previously suboptimal nature of the sysvinit

script, systemd systems would not correctly detect the daemon process as

running and thus could not stop the service. As a result, you may have to

manually kill the process and start the service after upgrading (i.e.

killall ircd-hybrid; systemctl start ircd-hybrid.service).

**Updated Packages:**

i586:

ircd-hybrid-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.i586.rpm

ircd-hybrid-devel-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.i586.rpm

ircd-hybrid-debug-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.i586.rpm

x86\_64:

ircd-hybrid-7.2.3-10.3.mga2.x86\_64.rpm

Subject: ircd-hybrid: Denial of service vulnerability in
 hostmask.c:try_parse_v4_netmask()

Mr. Bob Nomnomnom from Torland reported a denial of service security
vulnerability in ircd-hybrid. Function hostmask.c:try_parse_v4_netmask() is
using strtoul to parse masks. Documentation says strtoul can parse "-number" as
well. Validation of input does not catch evil bits. I can give proof of concept
if needed.

Fixed in commit: http://svn.ircd-hybrid.org:8000/viewcvs.cgi/ircd-hybrid/trunk/src/hostmask.c?r1=1786&r2=1785&pathrev=1786
Fixed in: ircd-hybrid 8.0.6

I have requested CVE identifier for this vulnerability in another email to Kurt.
Other ircds are using the same code. Consider this email as official advisory. I
tried to embargo this issue, but the commit is out already.

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x000000000041c799 in try_parse_v4_netmask (text=<value optimized out>, addr=0x113e270, b=0x113e2f8) at hostmask.c:229

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Smells like something else is up with that machine to cause the failure.  Can you turn systemd into debug mode (either via rebooting and appending systemd.log_level=debug or by doing a kill to PID 1 with an appropriate signal (I forget which but it's in the man page).  Then after trying to start the unit, there should be some info about why it failed due to "resources" in the "journalctl -f" output (assuming you have it running in another shell).  Of course if you've not rebooted it in a while, then perhaps just try that?  Also what kernel is this? Is it the regular desktop one? Might be some missing module somewhere that is needed (tho' rather unlikely) if it's not the desktop one. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=9001#c15)  claire robinson    2013-02-12 19:01:28 CET  ``` I'll try the reboot bit in the morning colin if that's ok.  # uname -r 3.4.24-desktop-3.mga2 ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=9001#c16)  claire robinson    2013-02-12 19:58:57 CET  ``` Testing complete mga2 32  Installed and started the service then connected to localhost with an irc client.

Here we see the watch for the pid file starting and stopping almost immediately and then an immediate failed state.  This to me suggests that something, somewhere, is eating up all the inotify watches and systemd is starved and cannot watch for the pid file and thus bails and the failure code is "resources".  I'll see if I can dig up more info. I'll also test here on x86_64 ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=9001#c20)  Colin Guthrie    2013-02-13 11:16:00 CET  ``` Scratch my above analysis. I think I know the problem as I also see it as having failed with "resource".  In my case however ircd-hybrid is still running.  Actually I think this is due to how ircd delegates to it's own user for starting. i.e. the process actually escapes the cgroup and instead has a user session started (thus getting it's own cgroup). Thus systemd sees the process disappear and fails with "resources" (slightly confusing yes).  So I can confirm it's working fine for me on x86_64, (with pid and process) but it's certainly sub-optimal as systemd things it's failed!  I strongly suspect that this would also be the case on i586. Can you confirm?  $ ps ax -O cgroup| grep ircd  6860 name=systemd:/user/ircd-hybrid/c70041 S ?      00:00:00 /usr/sbin/ircd-hybrid  Here the cgroup is shown as "systemd:/user/ircd-hybrid/..." which is not a service cgroup, but a user one. This shows that the way the ircd sysvinit script drops user privs is not ideal.  Regardless, I doubt very much this is any different to the ircd shipped with mga2 so I would personally suggest we should validate this update.   I will ensure the startup system is rewritten for cauldron/mga3 to avoid this confusing behaviour.  I suspect the reason for yours exiting to be some kind of configuration error that just causes it to die without writing much to it's log. Perhaps try su'ing to the ircd-hybrid user (you'll have to pass -s) and running the daemon manually to see if you can work out why it exits for your own piece of mind (and mine!) that my explanation is correct! ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=9001#c21)  claire robinson    2013-02-13 13:23:19 CET  ``` # su -s /bin/bash ircd-hybrid  [ircd-hybrid@mega ~]$ ircd-hybrid -foreground -configfile /etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf   ircd: version hybrid-7.2.3 ircd: pid 25019 ircd: running in foreground mode from /usr --(end of buffer or a NUL) --accepting rule at line 77 ("# Hybrid 7 minimal example configuration file") --(end of buffer or a NUL) --accepting rule at line 74 (" #") --accepting rule at line 77 ("#") --(end of buffer or a NUL) --accepting rule at line 74 (" # $Id: simple.conf 33 2005-10-02 20:50:00Z knight $") --accepting rule at line 77 ("# $Id: simple.conf 33 2005-10-02 20:50:00Z knight $") --(end of buffer or a NUL)  ..etc  --accepting rule at line 77 ("#};") --(end of buffer or a NUL) --accepting rule at line 74 (" ") --(end of buffer or a NUL) --EOF (start condition 0)  $ ps aux | grep hybrid root     23700  0.0  0.0  60032  1852 pts/1    S    11:45   0:00 su -s /bin/bash ircd-hybrid 458      25525  0.0  0.0   9680   876 pts/1    S+   11:57   0:00 grep hybrid   I changed the log level to debug in ircd.conf and tried it again but it doesn't show any extra details.

Perhaps it bails because it cannot bind on the IPv6 address. Already in use could mean that it's somehow conflicting with itself when binding like this.  I'm not an IPv6 expert yet, but I did read this yesterday:  They share address space; IPv4 is blended into IPv6 at  ::ffff:0000:0000/96, and so something listening on [::] also listens on  0.0.0.0 by default.  So perhaps this error: [2013/2/13 12.01] binding listener socket [0::/6667]:Address already in use  Is somehow because it's conflicting with itself? I'm really not sure, but considering you cannot get the original working there and I have been running it happily for some time, I can only presume it's some kind of setup error on that machine in some capacity.  That said, I'm still running on the older (original) kernel for now, so I'll see when I get around to rebooting and installing the 3.4 kernel).  Either way, you may want to consider my successful tests sufficient for validation here while you narrow down exactly what's wrong? ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=9001#c25)  claire robinson    2013-02-13 14:19:38 CET  ``` I'll create a new bug for it colin, sure.  Given it is failing completely on an updated machine I'd rather somebody else checks x86_64 too, if it's ok.  I literally only installed and tried to start it on both machines, one starts and I can connect to it but the other doesn't. It could be some obscure network issue so if it works for somebody else x86_64 I'm happy to validate it. ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=9001#c26)  Carolyn Rowse    2013-02-13 17:34:15 CET  ``` I couldn't get it to start on x86_64 either.

Tested the fixes on cauldron and the mga2 stuff should be much the same (I've specifically tweaked the bits I know are different).  Fixes applied:  * Module+Messages path under x86_64 is fixed.  * Added systemd unit to prevent the startup failure report (even if it runs OK) under systemd.  All seems fine here, but I will test on both my 64 bit machines when done.  Thanks for being patient and sorry for not fixing the issue I found waaay back when - it was a busy time and I pretty much instantly forgot about it.  ircd-hybrid-7.2.3-10.2.mga2 on it's way to a mirror near you soon. ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=9001#c30)  Colin Guthrie    2013-02-13 23:35:10 CET  ``` FWIW, tested on two x86_64 machines and both seem fine (with my hacky symlink removed!), but I'll let claire do the official confirmation.  Note that when you update an existing machine on i586, if ircd-hybrid process is running, you'll have to kill it manually as systemd has "lost" the process due to it escaping it's cgroup. This isn't something we can easily work around without horrible hacks so I figure it's an edge case. Could be worth documenting in the advisory tho'.
