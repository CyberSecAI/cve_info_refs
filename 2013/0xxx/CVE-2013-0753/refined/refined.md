  "CVE-2013-0753": {
    "Description": "Security researcher regenrecht reported, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, a use-after-free in XMLSerializer by the exposing of `serializeToStream` to web content. This can lead to arbitrary code execution when exploited.",
    "Root cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in XMLSerializer when the serializeToStream method is exposed to web content.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted web page"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious web page.",
        "More_Info": "The vulnerability is related to how XMLSerializer handles `serializeToStream` when exposed to web content, potentially allowing an attacker to cause a use-after-free condition and then execute arbitrary code. In Thunderbird and SeaMonkey, the flaw can not be exploited through email because scripting is disabled."
