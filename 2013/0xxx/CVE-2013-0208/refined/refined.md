{
  "cve": "CVE-2013-0208",
  "description": "The boot-from-volume feature in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom and Essex, when using nova-volumes, allows remote authenticated users to boot from other users' volumes via a volume id in the block_device_mapping parameter.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Folsom",
    "Essex"
  ],
  "fixed_versions": [],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The boot-from-volume feature in OpenStack Nova did not correctly validate if the user attempting to boot an image was permitted to do so. Specifically, it failed to verify that a user-specified volume ID in the block_device_mapping parameter belonged to that user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)",
      "Insufficient Authorization Checks"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user could bypass intended restrictions and boot from volumes they do not own, potentially gaining full access to data stored on those third-party volumes.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable through the API endpoint used for booting from a volume, specifically via the `block_device_mapping` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be an authenticated user within the OpenStack environment. They also need to know the volume ID of a target volume they don't own."
