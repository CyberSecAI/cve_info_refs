disallow boot from volume from specifying arbitrary volumes

```
Fix a vulnerability in volume attachment in nova-volume, affecting the
boot-from-volume feature.  By passing a specific volume ID, an
authenticated user may be able to boot from a volume they don't own,
potentially resulting in full access to that 3rd-party volume.

Fixes bug: 1069904, [CVE-2013-0208](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rr64-vh7q-pgrf "CVE-2013-0208")
Change-Id: I5f7c8d20d3ebf33ce1ce64bf0a8418bd2b5a6411

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0208)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues and multiple
bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (code name Nova), a
cloud computing fabric controller.

The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2012.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.

This update also fixes the following security issues:

It was found that the boot-from-volume feature in nova-volume did not
correctly validate if the user attempting to boot an image was permitted
to do so. An authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass
intended restrictions, allowing them to boot images they would otherwise
not have access to, exposing data stored in other users' images. This
issue did not affect configurations using the Cinder block storage
mechanism, which is the default in Red Hat OpenStack. (CVE-2013-0208)

When OpenStack Nova was configured to provide guest instances with libvirt
and said guests used LVM-backed ephemeral storage
("libvirt\_images\_type=lvm" in "/etc/nova/nova.conf"), the contents of the
physical volume were not wiped before the volume was returned to the system
for use by a different guest instance. This could lead to a new instance
being able to access files and data from a previous instance. This issue
did not affect configurations using the Cinder block storage mechanism,
which is the default in Red Hat OpenStack. (CVE-2012-5625)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Phil Day as the original reporter of
CVE-2013-0208, and Eric Windisch as the original reporter of CVE-2012-5625.

All users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the Nova running services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c0)  Perry Myers    2012-12-14 15:52:23 UTC  ``` This bug is a temporary workaround for RHOS 2.1 release until a longer term solution can be implemented to use virtio drivers as part of [bug # 865345](show_bug.cgi?id=865345)  The global default for NIC should be changed to e1000 from rtl.  This will provide better performance, at the expense of support for Windows XP guests (which is out of support anyhow)  In a future release we would ideally use a combination of libosinfo and libguestfs to determine based on the image type (storage as image metadata in glance perhaps) and based on whether or not the correct drivers are installed (via libguestfs probing) which network driver to optimally use.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c1)  Nikola Dipanov    2012-12-14 17:24:57 UTC  ``` This seems to be a tweak in the nova.conf that comes with our rpms.  Assigning to Martin to do the nova.conf we ship as a SOURCE in our RPMs.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c2)  Daniel Berrangé    2012-12-17 10:10:52 UTC  ``` Given that Nova already hardcodes use of virtio for disks, defaulting to virtio for networking too leaves us no worse off in terms of guest OS compat. This should also be done upstream, not in a RH specific patch.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c3)  Daniel Berrangé    2012-12-17 15:34:15 UTC  ``` Changing subject from e1000 to virtio, on the basis that we already have a hardcoded requirement for virtio.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c4)  Perry Myers    2012-12-17 15:36:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c2)) > Given that Nova already hardcodes use of virtio for disks, defaulting to > virtio for networking too leaves us no worse off in terms of guest OS > compat. This should also be done upstream, not in a RH specific patch.  Re: virtio for disks, I filed [bug # 887910](show_bug.cgi?id=887910 "CLOSED NOTABUG - Change default block device to be IDE") to track that separately.  I agree though, that unless we address the block device issue, it makes no sense to address the NIC issue.  Also agree wrt upstream.  If we're going to change the defaults in RHOS, they should be changed in Fedora/EPEL OpenStack as well.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c5)  Daniel Berrangé    2012-12-17 15:42:13 UTC  ``` Patch posted upstream to default to virtio for KVM/QEMU  <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/18233/>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c6)  Perry Myers    2012-12-17 17:27:07 UTC  ``` We'll take danpb's patch in [Comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c5) to make the default virtio NICs, but accelerate fix to allow manual override of the drivers on a per guest basis so that we allow for images that don't have virtio drivers.  That will become the focus of [bug # 865345](show_bug.cgi?id=865345)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c10)  Ofer Blaut    2013-01-17 08:49:35 UTC  ``` Tests on openstack-nova-network-2012.2.2-5.el6ost.noarch  Default Nic is virtio  ( checked both on lspci on VM and qeum on host )   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c11)  Alan Pevec    2013-01-18 15:49:03 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 901596](show_bug.cgi?id=901596) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-30 21:07:37 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

disallow boot from volume from specifying arbitrary volumes

```
Fix a vulnerability in volume attachment in nova-volume, affecting the
boot-from-volume feature.  By passing a specific volume ID, an
authenticated user may be able to boot from a volume they don't own,
potentially resulting in full access to that 3rd-party volume.
Folsom setups making use of Cinder are not affected.

Fixes bug: 1069904, [CVE-2013-0208](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rr64-vh7q-pgrf "CVE-2013-0208")
Change-Id: I5f7c8d20d3ebf33ce1ce64bf0a8418bd2b5a6411

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

We found this problem in our Diablo code base - I think by inspection its still valid in upstream as well but a bit harder to check as the code has changed (BootFromVolumeController no longer exists, and os-volume\_boot now just inherits from the servers API).

Fillling anyway as its pretty serious, in the hope that someone can verify or dismiss it.

Boot from volume allows a volume to be passed to the create method via the block\_device\_mapping parameter. This parameter is not validated as having to be a volume belonging to the user creating the instance, so providing I know the valid ID of a volume belonging to another user I can create VM and gain access to that volume (c.f volume attachment which does make explicit checks for both the ownership and status of a volume)

The volume ownership and status should be explicitly checked in the compute.api layer

The connection code attaches to the volume using api commands to cinder. Volumes belonging to other users will not be visible, so this shouldn't be possible in folsom.

attach\_volume is definitely not affected. It appears that attach\_volume\_boot has an elevated context so it may be possible to boot off of other peoples volumes. This appears to affect folsom/nova-volumes as well, although it should be verified. A simple fix would be to make sure we don't have an elevated context before doing the volume\_api.get and volume\_api.get\_snapshot code in stable/essex here:

375 # TODO(yamahata): default name and description

 376 snapshot = self.volume\_api.get\_snapshot(context,

 377 bdm['snapshot\_id'])

 378 vol = self.volume\_api.create(context, bdm['volume\_size'],

 379 '', '', snapshot)

 380 # TODO(yamahata): creating volume simultaneously

 381 # reduces creation time?

 382 self.volume\_api.wait\_creation(context, vol)

 383 self.db.block\_device\_mapping\_update(

 384 context, bdm['id'], {'volume\_id': vol['id']})

 385 bdm['volume\_id'] = vol['id']

 386

 387 if bdm['volume\_id'] is not None:

 388 volume = self.volume\_api.get(context, bdm['volume\_id'])

 389 self.volume\_api.check\_attach(context, volume)

 390 cinfo = self.\_attach\_volume\_boot(context,

 391 instance,

 392 volume,

Now I'm confused. I understood that Grizzly was unaffected and now you say you have a trunk patch...

Which series are actually affected ?

Adding nova-core for security patch review.

ttx: only using nova-volumes is affected which means it doesn't affect grizzly. The fix involves checking at the api layer which is actually still valuable in trunk even though the security issue is not present. It should apply against folsom just fine. Rmk is working on a version for essex.

(the reason the patch is still valuable against trunk is it makes the failure happen at the api layer which causes the create to fail fast instead of putting the instance into error later in the process)

@vish: thx for the explanation. As far as this security bug goes, I'll just consider it doesn't apply to Grizzly (even if pushing the fix there can't hurt).

Adding Daviey so that he can look into stable/diablo being affected or not.

@rmk: any progress on the Essex patch ?

Adding the full Diablo maintenance team (rather than just Dave) to evaluate Diablo's vulnerability, although having the Essex patch will help in assessing that.

My proposed impact description:

Title: Boot from volume allows access to random volumes

Reporter: Phil Day (HP)

Products: Nova

Affects: ??

Description:

Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in volume attachment in nova-volume, affecting the boot-from-volume feature. By passing a specific volume ID, an authenticated user may be able to boot from a volume he doesn't own, potentially resulting in full access to that 3rd-party volume contents. Folsom setups making use of Cinder are not affected.

Thierry - re the grizzly patch - it looks good although the same thing is done in compute manager's \_setup\_block\_device\_mapping.

Just a heads up: I am trying to rework BDMs at the moment as part of [https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/improve-block-device-handling](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/%2Bspec/improve-block-device-handling) - and I am hoping to propose more thorough validations as a part of those changes. so I am likely to remove/rework the bit of nova.api. The patch should be ready during next week.

it passes its testsuite as well (I would attach the patch, but I had to massage it a little for the version of Folsom in Ubuntu).

Visually inspecting Diablo, it seems affected too (the original report was against Diablo, so I am not sure why it is marked Incomplete...).

Attached is a patch for Diablo backported from Essex with my changes above. It does pass the testsuite included in Diablo on Ubuntu, but beyond that I haven't tested it.

Argh. We really need that private Gerrit and tests to validate patches better. Thanks for catching that. I suggest we push back publication to next Tuesday (this was a really short embargo period) and communicate the new set of patches to the stakeholders. Russell, thoughts?

About Diablo, we were waiting for a confirmation since the Diablo code base mentioned in the report is based on an early and heavily patched milestone :) The diablo-maint team didn't really pick it up though, hence the "Incomplete" status.

Red Hat are OK with this going out today at least. The ammendments simple.

Though when verifiying them I noticed the logic could be simplified somewhat.

Also the existing patches didn't contain commit messages.

Also all didn't apply cleanly to the latest trees.

Also the essex and diablo ones duplicated the InvalidSnapshot exception class.

So I redid all the patches against the latest trees , and collated all the info

from this bug report into the commit messages, and verified pertinent tests pass.

disallow boot from volume from specifying arbitrary volumes

Fix a vulnerability in volume attachment in nova-volume, affecting the

    boot-from-volume feature. By passing a specific volume ID, an

    authenticated user may be able to boot from a volume they don't own,

    potentially resulting in full access to that 3rd-party volume.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-22 06:17:22 UTC  ```  Russel Bryant rbryant reports on behalf of the OpenStack Project:  Title: Boot from volume allows access to random volumes Reporter: Phil Day (HP) Products: Nova Affects: Essex, Folsom  Description: Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in volume attachment in nova-volume, affecting the boot-from-volume feature. By passing a specific volume ID, an authenticated user may be able to boot from a volume he doesn't own, potentially resulting in full access to that 3rd-party volume contents. Folsom setups making use of Cinder are not affected.  Proposed patches: See attached patches for the Folsom and Essex series. Unless a flaw is discovered in them, these proposed patches will be merged to Nova stable/folsom and stable/essex branches on the public disclosure date.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-22 06:51:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 684893](attachment.cgi?id=684893&action=diff "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=684893&action=edit "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-22 06:52:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 684894](attachment.cgi?id=684894&action=diff "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=684894&action=edit "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-25 05:10:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 687206](attachment.cgi?id=687206&action=diff "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=687206&action=edit "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c8)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-25 05:11:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 687207](attachment.cgi?id=687207&action=diff "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=687207&action=edit "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-25 05:14:15 UTC  ``` Updated patches have been released, the old ones are incorrect and should not be used, I have marked them as obsolete.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c10)  Murray McAllister    2013-01-29 04:54:24 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: [OSSA 2013-001] Boot from volume allows access to random volumes
 (CVE-2013-0208)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-001
CVE: CVE-2013-0208
Date: January 29, 2013
Title: Boot from volume allows access to random volumes
Reporter: Phil Day (HP)
Products: Nova
Affects: Essex, Folsom

Description:
Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in volume attachment in
nova-volume, affecting the boot-from-volume feature. By passing a
specific volume ID, an authenticated user may be able to boot from a
volume he doesn't own, potentially resulting in full access to that
3rd-party volume contents. Folsom setups making use of Cinder are not
affected.

Folsom fix (included in upcoming Nova 2012.2.3 stable update):
<http://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/317cc0af385536dee43ef2addad50a91357fc1ad>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

By passing a specific volume ID, an authenticated user may be able to boot from a volume he doesn't own, potentially resulting in full access to that 3rd-party volume contents. Folsom setups making use of Cinder are not affected.  Proposed patches: See attached patches for the Folsom and Essex series. Unless a flaw is discovered in them, these proposed patches will be merged to Nova stable/folsom and stable/essex branches on the public disclosure date.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-22 06:51:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 684893](attachment.cgi?id=684893&action=diff "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=684893&action=edit "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-22 06:52:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 684894](attachment.cgi?id=684894&action=diff "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=684894&action=edit "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-25 05:10:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 687206](attachment.cgi?id=687206&action=diff "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=687206&action=edit "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c8)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-25 05:11:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 687207](attachment.cgi?id=687207&action=diff "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=687207&action=edit "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-25 05:14:15 UTC  ``` Updated patches have been released, the old ones are incorrect and should not be used, I have marked them as obsolete.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c10)  Murray McAllister    2013-01-29 04:54:24 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
