  "response": {
    "CVE-2013-0777": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an order-dependent ownership issue in `nsCSSRendering::PaintBoxShadowOuter`. A `gfxContext` strong pointer delays the destruction of `nsContextBoxBlur::mContext`, while the surface data is owned by `nsContextBoxBlur::blur`. When `nsContextBoxBlur::blur` is destroyed first, the `shadowContext` surface points to deallocated memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the heap, potentially leading to information disclosure. While unlikely on the main thread due to memory allocation patterns, another thread could have allocated and filled the freed memory, thus making this a potential risk.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by visiting a specially crafted webpage, specifically during the print operation of the page. The issue was observed in Print but not Print Preview.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to trick a user into opening a specially crafted webpage and initiating a print action. This vulnerability exists in the rendering of box shadows."
    },
    "CVE-2013-0778": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is an incorrect offset value being used in `nsFrame::SelectByTypeAtPoint` when calling `PeekBackwardAndForward`.  The function uses `offsets.offset` instead of the correct `offset` after `GetFrameForNodeOffset` updates it. This leads to an out-of-bounds read when `ClusterIterator::NextCluster` is called.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a potential denial of service due to a crash. Although the vulnerability involves an out-of-bounds read and not a write, it still has security implications as it may potentially leak information from memory, thereby defeating ASLR.",
       "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by double-clicking anywhere in the content window of a webpage.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a specially crafted webpage. Double-clicking inside the content window will trigger the out-of-bounds read."
