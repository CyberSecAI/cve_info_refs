| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=892909#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 08:36:35 UTC  ```  Michael Scherer (misc) of Red Hat reports:  Description of problem:  In the connection hooks set by using a scaled application : <https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/cartridges/openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.4/info/connection-hooks/set-proxy#L63>   the following code is used :     cp -f "$haproxy_cfg" /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$    sed -i "/\s*server\s*gear-${gear_name}\s.*/d" /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$    cat /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ > "$haproxy_cfg"    rm -f /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$  If someone manage to be able to create enough directories in /tmp/ ( like  /tmp/haproxy.cfg.1 to 65000, with a for loop ), since the code never check  any return code of the binary, the haproxy configuration will be erased at  the 3rd line of the snippet, resulting in a DoS.  Another possibility is using enough file in /tmp with 444 mode, so cp would  not be able to erase it, but cat would still copy it in the haproxy  configuration, thus permitting to inject anything into haproxy configuration  ( I can imagine someone redirecting trafic to the wrong host, etc ).  This code is called when the application is scaled, if I understand well the  documentation. However, I do not know if this can be triggered externally and  how. In doubt, I will consider this as a security issue, and let the SRT judge if that's right or not  You will find a non tested patch attached to this bug report against latest  HEAD. instead of copying and then modifying using sed, it would be better to  directly modify the file. I am not sure the code is correct as I suspect it  may fail in weird in case of concurrent editing, but I think the previous one  would also had a issue with that case.  As all others bug I opened this evening/afternoon, this is mitigated by the  usage of polyinstanciated /tmp directory on openshift online, so the problem  would just be for enterprise users who do not follow the security  recommendation ( or people setting up origin by themselves ).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=892909#c3)  Murray McAllister    2013-09-17 14:45:40 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Michael Scherer of the Red Hat Regional IT team.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=892909#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2014-01-08 05:09:50 UTC  ``` So in total we have:  ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/bin/control:        cp -f "$haproxy_cfg" /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/bin/control:        sed -i "/$1/ s#\$# disabled#g" /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/bin/control:        cat /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ > "$haproxy_cfg" ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/bin/control:        rm -f /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/bin/control:        cp -f "$haproxy_cfg" /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/bin/control:        sed -i "/$1/ s#disabled\$##g" /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/bin/control:        cat /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ > "$haproxy_cfg" ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/bin/control:        rm -f /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/fix_local.sh:     cp -f $haproxy_cfg /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/fix_local.sh:     sed -i "/\s*server\s*local-gear\s.*/d" /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/fix_local.sh:     echo "    server local-gear $local_ep weight 0" >> /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/fix_local.sh:     cat /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ > "$haproxy_cfg" ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/fix_local.sh:     rm -f /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/update-cluster:cp -f "$haproxy_cfg" /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/update-cluster:        sed -i "/\s*server\s*gear-$sg\s.*/d" /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/update-cluster:sed -i "/\s*server\s*local-gear\s.*/d" /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/update-cluster:echo "    server local-gear $local_ep check fall 2 rise 3 inter 2000 cookie local-$OPENSHIFT_GEAR_UUID" >> /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/update-cluster:cat /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$ > "$haproxy_cfg" ./openshift-origin-cartridge-haproxy-1.17.3/usr/bin/update-cluster:rm -f /tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=892909#c6)  Brenton Leanhardt    2014-01-10 16:25:09 UTC  ``` Wow, this bug is over a year old. :(.  Looks like the set-proxy and fix-local.sh script need to be updated.  This bug affects OSE 2.0 too so we should probably have a tracking bug there as well.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=892909#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2014-09-06 05:36:39 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of the haproxy cartridge as shipped with Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1 and 2. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>. Additionally OpenShift uses a per user poly-instantiated /tmp directory which makes exploitation of this issue very difficult.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=892909#c10)  Ján Rusnačko    2015-10-23 15:11:42 UTC  ``` I edited statement in [comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=892909#c9) and making [comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=892909#c8) private.   ``` |  |
