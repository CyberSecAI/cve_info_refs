Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the usage of predictable temporary files in the set-proxy connection hook of the OpenShift haproxy cartridge. Specifically, the scripts create temporary files in /tmp using a predictable pattern, which can be exploited if an attacker can create files or directories in /tmp with specific names.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Predictable temporary file names: The scripts use the pattern `/tmp/haproxy.cfg.$$`, where `$$` is the process ID. This makes the temporary file names predictable.
- Lack of error checking: The scripts do not check the return codes of commands like `cp`, `sed`, and `rm`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if these commands fail (e.g., if the attacker has created a directory with same name, or a read only file).
- Insecure file handling: The scripts copy the haproxy configuration to the predictable temporary file, modify it, and then copy it back. This process is susceptible to race conditions if an attacker can manipulate the temporary file between the copy and modification or copy back.
- Injection vulnerability: By creating a read-only file in `/tmp` with the expected filename, the `cp` command will fail, but `cat` would overwrite the haproxy config allowing an attacker to insert arbitrary configurations.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could fill `/tmp` with many directories and files which will result in the haproxy configuration being erased leading to a DoS condition.
- Arbitrary Configuration Injection: An attacker could inject arbitrary configuration into the haproxy configuration file by creating a read-only file in `/tmp`, potentially redirecting traffic to malicious hosts or performing other malicious actions.

Attack vectors:
- File creation/manipulation in /tmp: An attacker needs the ability to create files and directories in the `/tmp` directory on the system where the OpenShift haproxy cartridge is running.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to create files/directories in `/tmp`.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the scaling of an OpenShift application or trigger the relevant scripts to execute their attack.
