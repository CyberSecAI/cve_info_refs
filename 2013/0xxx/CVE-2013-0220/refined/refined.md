found\nin Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,\nImportant, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common\nVulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems\nprovide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and\nschedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the\nrisk each issue places on your unique environment.\n\nThe four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue\nto be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important\nupdates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.\n\nThe following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).\n\n| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |\n| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |\n| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ€™ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâ€™s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |\n\nA Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one\nvulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a\nseverity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory\nis the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all\nthe products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only\nshow the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the\nrelevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can\nexamine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well\nas links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâ€™s CVE database.\n\nWhen a technologyâ€”enabled and most likely used by defaultâ€”completely\nblocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all\narchitectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology\nreduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level\nand give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking\u00a0 and CVE\ndatabase entries.\n\n## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\n\nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide\nadditional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity\nrating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack\nVector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,\nScope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.\n\nCVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from\n2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red\nHat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going\nforward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on\nthe\n[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)\n(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).\n\nRed Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority\nwith which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the\nvulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key\nmetrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is\ndetermined by the overall severity of the flaw using the\naforementioned four-point scale.\u00a0 CVSS is meant to help customers\nprioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.\n\n### CVSS v3 Base Metrics\n\nThe CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a\nvulnerability:\n\n* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the \"remoteness\" of the attack and\n  how the vulnerability is exploited.\n* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an\n  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along\n  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the\n  Access Complexity metric.).\n* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an\n  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.\n* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user\n  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This\n  replaces the former Authentication metric.).\n* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component\n  beyond its security scope/authority.\n* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can\n  access data and to what extent.\n* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and\n  veracity of data.\n* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or\n  services for authorized users.\n\nA formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base\nscore, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to\n[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)\nfor detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note\nthat the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other\nCVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to\nprovide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.\nAlone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability\nitself without accounting for deployment or the environment.\n\n### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics\n\nWe aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,\nand Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects\nour products specifically.\u00a0 In addition, we do not use the Qualitative\nSeverity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,\nand our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned\nfour-point scale.\u00a0 In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a\nflaw received a particular score. The following are some common\nvulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:\n\n#### Libraries\n\nIt is not always possible to know how third-party applications use\nlibraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics\nfor flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into\naccount the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and\nalso look at other popular software that may use the library in a way\nthat would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the\nscore appropriately.\n\n#### Other Common Scores\n\nFlaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash\n(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,\n[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).\n\nFlaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their\nprivileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,\n[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).\n\nCross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact\nto Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,\nin line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for\nthese flaws is 6.1 (for example,\n[CVE-2020-11023](
