Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-0004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the .NET Framework's improper validation of permissions for certain objects in memory. This improper validation allows for a potential elevation of privilege.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Object Permission Validation:** The core weakness is the inadequate check of permissions associated with objects in memory within the .NET Framework.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could grant an attacker complete control over the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could install programs.
- **Data Manipulation:** They could view, change, or delete data.
- **Account Creation:** Creation of new accounts with full user rights becomes possible.
- The impact is higher for users with administrative rights compared to those with fewer user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Browsing Scenario:** An attacker could host a malicious website containing a specially crafted XAML Browser Application (XBAP) designed to exploit the vulnerability. By convincing a user to visit this website, the attacker could trigger the exploit.
- **Windows .NET Application Scenario:** Malicious Windows .NET Framework applications could also leverage this vulnerability to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Web Browsing Attack:**
    - The attacker needs to host a malicious website.
    - The attacker must convince the user to visit the malicious website (e.g., through phishing, social engineering).
    - The targeted user needs to be using a web browser capable of running XBAPs.
- **Windows .NET Application Attack:**
    - The attacker needs to deliver and execute a malicious .NET application on the target system.
    - The malicious application needs to be capable of exploiting the specific vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided document indicates that Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the initial bulletin release.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the .NET Framework validates the permissions of objects in memory.
- Workarounds for this vulnerability involve disabling or prompting for XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer and adding trusted sites.
