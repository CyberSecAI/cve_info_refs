Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insecure DLL loading practice within the Mozilla Updater. Specifically, the `updater.exe` attempts to load the `cryptsp.dll` from the same directory as the updater, instead of loading it from a secure system directory. This could also affect `cryptbase.dll`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking/Planting:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to DLL hijacking or planting. By placing a malicious `cryptsp.dll` (or `cryptbase.dll`) in the update directory, an attacker could trick the updater into loading and executing the malicious code.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The updater runs with elevated privileges, either through the Mozilla Maintenance Service or independently on systems not using the service. Therefore, loading a malicious DLL allows for arbitrary code execution with system-level privileges.
*   **Lack of Secure DLL Loading:** The updater does not ensure that the DLL is loaded from the system directory, instead relying on the current working directory of the updater process to resolve the path to DLL files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code with system-level privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-integrity process could gain access to high-integrity resources and execute privileged operations.
*   **Full System Compromise:** In a successful attack, an attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Access:** The attacker needs write access to the local file system to place a malicious DLL into the same directory where the updater is located.
*   **Execution of Mozilla Updater:** The malicious DLL is loaded only when the Mozilla Updater is executed, which could be during an automated update or triggered manually.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local file system access with the ability to create/modify files in the updater directory to place the malicious DLL.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Software:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and the mechanism by which the updater attempts to load the DLL.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple Mozilla products, including Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and Thunderbird ESR.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher named "Ash".
*   The fix involves adding the vulnerable DLLs (cryptsp.dll and cryptbase.dll) to a list of safe DLLs to load, so they are loaded from the correct system paths.
*   The fix was initially landed in Mozilla Central, and backported to affected release branches.
*  A separate bug, [843770](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=843770), was filed to add a `SetDllDirectory(L"")` call to the updater as a precaution against other similar DLL loading issues, but was not a direct fix for this vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability affects all older, supported branches, according to a comment in the bug report.
