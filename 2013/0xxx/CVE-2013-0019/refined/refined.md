Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-0019:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (UAF) error in the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. Specifically, it occurs in the `CDoc::ExecuteScriptUri` function within `MSHTML.dll`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that Internet Explorer attempts to access or manipulate a memory location after it has been freed, resulting in memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the user running Internet Explorer. This can allow an attacker to gain control of the system if the user has high privileges, like Administrator rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious web page that exploits the vulnerability.  When a user visits the crafted page using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer, it triggers the UAF condition. The attacker may also use compromised websites or those that host user-provided content or ads to deliver the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafted Web Page:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted HTML/XML page that will trigger the vulnerability in the victim's browser.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the target user to open the malicious web page. This can be done through social engineering tactics such as sending links via email or instant messages, or by hosting the page on a site the user might trust.

**Technical Details (from Exploit-DB and blog.skylined.nl):**
- The exploit uses an iframe.
- The exploit opens an XML file (`Repro.xml`) in the iframe.
- A javascript call is made to change the location.href to "about:blank"

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability was privately reported and addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-009.
- Disabling Javascript does NOT prevent exploitation.
- The affected software includes Internet Explorer 7, 8, and 9, and 10 on some versions of Windows.
