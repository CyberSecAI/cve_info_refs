Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-0194:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user inputs, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the application does not properly sanitize user input. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
- **Data Theft:** If an attacker successfully injects script, it could be used to redirect a user to a malicious site. 

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through network, meaning the attack can be launched remotely through the internet.
- The specific input fields that cause the XSS vulnerability are not specified but are mentioned as "unspecified vectors".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't need prior access to the server.
- **User Interaction:** Successful exploitation requires some form of user interaction to trigger the injected script.

**Additional Notes**
-   CVE-2013-0194 is specifically linked to a vulnerability in Piwik before version 1.10.1.
-   This CVE is distinct from CVE-2013-0193 and CVE-2013-0195, which are also related to XSS vulnerabilities in Piwik, but reported by different researchers.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in Piwik 1.10.1.
