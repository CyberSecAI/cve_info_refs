{
  "CVE-2013-0428": {
    "Root cause": "A flaw in the Java reflection API in how it handles access privileges of proxy classes.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect access privilege checks within the reflection API for proxy classes"
    ],
    "Impact": "An untrusted Java application or applet could bypass Java sandbox restrictions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security compromises.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploiting the reflection API through a malicious Java applet or application"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create and execute a malicious Java applet or application.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability can be exploited by creating arbitrary proxy objects for interfaces defined in restricted packages using a NULL class loader namespace. By combining this with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-0427, CVE-2013-0429) a complete JVM security bypass is possible."
