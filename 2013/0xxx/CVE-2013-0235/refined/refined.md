Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-0235:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how WordPress processes pingbacks through its XML-RPC API. Specifically, the `pingback.ping` method did not properly validate the source URL provided in pingback requests. This allowed attackers to manipulate the pingback process to trigger actions from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By providing a malicious source URL, attackers could force the WordPress server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources. This could expose sensitive information about the server's internal network or compromise other services.
- **Remote Port Scanning:** Attackers could use the pingback functionality to scan ports on internal network hosts by specifying URLs with different port numbers (e.g. `http://internal-host:22/`). The server's responses to open or closed ports would differ, allowing the attacker to determine if a given port was listening.
- **Abuse of XMLRPC API:** The exposed `pingback.ping` method within the XMLRPC API allowed for the vulnerability to be easily exploited with crafted requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gather information about internal hosts and services that are not publicly accessible.
- **Network Compromise:** Attackers could leverage the SSRF vulnerability to interact with other internal services which could lead to further compromise.
- **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS):** Attackers could initiate numerous pingback requests from multiple sources against a target URL, creating a distributed denial of service attack.
- **Internal Router Reconfiguration:** With support for URLs with credentials, attackers could potentially exploit the vulnerability to reconfigure network devices if they have a web interface accessible to the WordPress server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Pingback Requests:** The primary attack vector is sending crafted XML-RPC requests containing a malicious source URL to the WordPress site's `xmlrpc.php` endpoint, which triggers the `pingback.ping` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access to Target WordPress Site:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site, including the `xmlrpc.php` endpoint.
- **Understanding of Pingbacks and XML-RPC API:** Some technical knowledge of how pingbacks and the XML-RPC protocol works is required to craft malicious requests.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- **Specific Vulnerability Details:** The Acunetix blog post goes into more details regarding the ability to use URLs with credentials to reconfigure routers, and also demonstrates the different responses WordPress will give for valid and invalid host/ports.
- **Fix:** WordPress 3.5.1 addressed this vulnerability by implementing proper validation for source URLs in pingback requests, as seen in the changeset diff. It also introduced a new `pingback_ping_source_uri` filter for additional URL validation and also applied filters to error responses.
- **Red Hat Bugzilla:** Red Hat Bugzilla mentions that this vulnerability affects Fedora and EPEL versions of WordPress, and provides links to the commit that fixes the vulnerability and also additional resources.

In summary, CVE-2013-0235 was a significant vulnerability that allowed for SSRF, port scanning, and other attacks through the WordPress pingback system. The vulnerability has been addressed in WordPress 3.5.1 and all users of WordPress are urged to update.
