# WordPress 3.5.1 Maintenance and Security Release

---

WordPress 3.5.1 is now available. Version 3.5.1 is the first maintenance release of 3.5, [fixing 37 bugs](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5.1). It is also a security release for all previous WordPress versions. For a full list of changes, consult the [list of tickets](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=3.5.1) and the [changelog](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.5?rev=23341&stop_rev=23167), which include:

* Editor: Prevent certain HTML elements from being unexpectedly removed or modified in rare cases.
* Media: Fix a collection of minor workflow and compatibility issues in the new media manager.
* Networks: Suggest proper rewrite rules when creating a new network.
* Prevent scheduled posts from being stripped of certain HTML, such as video embeds, when they are published.
* Work around some misconfigurations that may have caused some JavaScript in the WordPress admin area to fail.
* Suppress some warnings that could occur when a plugin misused the database or user APIs.

Additionally, a bug affecting Windows servers running IIS can prevent updating from 3.5 to 3.5.1. If you receive the error “Destination directory for file streaming does not exist or is not writable,” you will need to [follow the steps outlined on the Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5.1).

WordPress 3.5.1 also addresses the following security issues:

* A server-side request forgery vulnerability and remote port scanning using pingbacks. This vulnerability, which could potentially be used to expose information and compromise a site, affects all previous WordPress versions. This was fixed by the WordPress security team. We’d like to thank security researchers [Gennady Kovshenin](http://codeseekah.com/) and [Ryan Dewhurst](http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/) for reviewing our work.
* Two instances of cross-site scripting via shortcodes and post content. These issues were discovered by Jon Cave of the WordPress security team.
* A cross-site scripting vulnerability in the external library Plupload. Thanks to the Moxiecode team for working with us on this, and for releasing Plupload 1.5.5 to address this issue.

# [WordPress Pingback Vulnerability](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/wordpress-pingback-vulnerability/)

![](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/22141821/image5.jpg)

**Note** — This post applies to an older version of Acunetix

Recently somebody posted on Reddit about a [WordPress scanner](https://github.com/FireFart/WordpressPingbackPortScanner "WordpressPingbackPortScanner") that is taking advantage of a new WordPress vulnerability. The vulnerability is abusing the Pingback system, which is a well-known feature that’s used by a lot of bloggers.

What is a Pingback?

> *Quoting Wikipedia:* A pingback is one of three types of linkbacks, methods for Web authors to request notification when somebody links to one of their documents. This enables authors to keep track of who is linking to, or referring to their articles. Some weblog software, such as Movable Type, Serendipity, WordPress, and Telligent Community, support automatic pingbacks where all the links in a published article can be pinged when the article is published.

WordPress has an XMLRPC API that can be accessed through the xmlrpc.php file. One of the methods exposed through this API is the **pingback.ping** method. With this method, other blogs can announce pingbacks. When WordPress is processing pingbacks, it’s trying to resolve the source URL, and if successful, will make a request to that URL and inspect the response for a link to a certain WordPress blog post. If it finds such a link, it will post a comment on this blog post announcing that somebody mentioned this blog post in their blog.

This can be abused in at least fours ways:

1. WordPress is trying to resolve the Source URL and will return different error messages if the Source URL exists (host exists) or not. This can be abused by attackers to try to guess hosts inside the internal network. The attackers can use URLs like http://subversion/ or  http://bugzilla/or http://dev/to see if these hosts exist in the internal network.
2. If the Source URL is resolved, WordPress will try to connect to the port specified in the URL. Therefore, if an attacker will use a URL like http://subversion:22/, WordPress will try to connect to the host subversion on port 22. The responses are different if the port is open or closed.  Therefore, this functionality can be used to port scan hosts inside the internal network.
3. This can also be used for distributed DOS (Denial of Service) attacks. An attacker can contact a large number of blogs and ask them to pingback a target URL. All of these blogs will attack the target URL.
4. From the tests I’ve carried out, I’ve seen that WordPress is also supporting URLs with credentials. So, an attacker can use a URL like http://admin:admin@192.168.0.1/changeDNS.asp?newDNS=aaaa to reconfigure the internal router like in the [email hack attack](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-zone/the-email-that-hacks-you/ "The email that hacks you").

I’ve made some screenshots to demonstrate how WordPress is returning different error messages for valid and invalid hosts/ports.

**Invalid Host**

![Invalid Host WordPress Pingback Vulnerability](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2012/12/invalid_host_wordpress_pingback_vulnerability-1024x563.png)

**Valid Host**

![Valid Host WordPress Pingback Vulnerability](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2012/12/valid_host_wordpress_pingback_vulnerability-1024x567.png)

I’ve implemented an [Acunetix WVS](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerability-scanner/ "Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner") script to test this vulnerability. This script will try to resolve various common internal hosts and try to connect to common ports. In the end, it will report the successful attempts. The script is available in the latest build (**20121213**) of Acunetix WVS. A sample alert looks like this:

![Wordpress Pingback Vulnerability Alert](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2012/12/wordpress_pingback_vulnerability_alert-354x270.png)

How do you protect against this vulnerability? Currently there is no fix. Disabling pingbacks and trackbacks from the Discussion Settings page doesn’t fix the problem either. The issue was [reported](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4137) to the WordPress Team and will probably be fixed soon. Until then, you can rename/delete the xmlrpc.php file. Please let me know if you have a better workaround.

On January 24, 2013, WordPress 3.5.1 was released to the public. This is a maintenance and security update.

## [Installation/Update Information](#installation-update-information)

To download WordPress 3.5.1, update automatically from the Dashboard > Updates menu in your site’s admin area or visit <https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/>.

For step-by-step instructions on installing and updating WordPress:

* [Updating WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/updating-wordpress/)

If you are new to WordPress, we recommend that you begin with the following:

* [New To WordPress – Where to Start](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/new_to_wordpress_-_where_to_start/)
* [First Steps With WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/first-steps-with-wordpress/) or [Upgrading WordPress Extended](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/upgrading-wordpress-extended-instructions/)
* [WordPress Lessons](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-lessons/)

## [Windows Servers Running IIS](#windows-servers-running-iis)

A bug affecting Windows servers running IIS can prevent updating from WordPress 3.5 to WordPress 3.5.1. If you receive the error “Destination directory for file streaming does not exist or is not writable,” you have a few options:

* **Option 1.** Manually install the [Hotfix](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hotfix/) plugin. Please see [the Codex instructions for manual plugin installation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
* **Option 2.** Add the following to your `wp-config.php`. Remove it after updating to WordPress 3.5.

```
define( 'WP_TEMP_DIR', ABSPATH . 'wp-content/' );

```

If you need assistance, please try the [WordPress Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/).

## [Summary](#summary)

From the [announcement post](https://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/), this maintenance release addresses 37 bugs with version 3.5, including:

* Editor: Prevent certain HTML elements from being unexpectedly removed or modified in rare cases.
* Media: Fix a collection of minor workflow and compatibility issues in the new media manager.
* Networks: Suggest proper rewrite rules when creating a new network.
* Prevent scheduled posts from being stripped of certain HTML, such as video embeds, when they are published.
* Work around some misconfigurations that may have caused some JavaScript in the WordPress admin area to fail.
* Suppress some warnings that could occur when a plugin misused the database or user APIs.

Additionally: Version 3.5.1 fixes a few security issues:

* Server-side request forgery (SSRF) and remote port scanning via pingbacks. Fixed by the WordPress security team. CVE-2013-0235.
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) via shortcodes and post content. Discovered by Jon Cave of the WordPress security team. CVE-2013-0236.
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) in the external library Plupload. Plupload 1.5.5 was released to address this issue. CVE-2013-0237.

A full log of the changes made for 3.5.1 can be found at <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.5?rev=23341&stop_rev=23167>.
