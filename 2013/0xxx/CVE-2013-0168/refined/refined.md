    "root_cause": "Insufficient permission checks in the `MoveDisk` command within Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager (RHEV-M).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authorization",
      "Insufficient permission validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user, specifically a storage administrator of a storage domain, can exploit this flaw to conduct a denial-of-service attack on another storage domain. This is achieved by moving a disk to a target storage domain where the admin doesn't have privileges, thereby exhausting the available free space.",

      "Network access to RHEV-M",
      "Abuse of the `MoveDisk` command"
