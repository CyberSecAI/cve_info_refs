# [Security-news] SA-CORE-2013-001 - Drupal core - Multiple vulnerabilities

View online: <http://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-001>

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CORE-2013-001
  * Project: Drupal core [1]
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-January-16
  * Security risk: Highly critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in the supported Drupal core versions 6
and 7.

.... Cross-site scripting (Various core and contributed modules - Drupal 6
      and 7)

A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) was identified in
certain Drupal JavaScript functions that pass unexpected user input into
jQuery causing it to insert HTML into the page when the intended behavior is
to select DOM elements. Multiple core and contributed modules are affected by
this issue.

jQuery versions 1.6.3 and higher provide protection against common forms of
this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your site has upgraded
to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions of jQuery that are
shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not contain this protection.

Although the fix added to Drupal as part of this security release prevents
the most common forms of this issue in the same way as newer versions of
jQuery do, developers should be aware that passing untrusted user input
directly to jQuery functions such as jQuery() and $() is unsafe and should be
avoided.

CVE: Requested.

.... Access bypass (Book module printer friendly version - Drupal 6 and 7)

A vulnerability was identified that exposes the title or, in some cases, the
content of nodes that the user should not have access to.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the bypass is only
accessible to users who already have the 'access printer-friendly version'
permission (which is not granted to Anonymous or Authenticated users by
default) and it only affects nodes that are part of a book outline.

CVE: Requested.

.... Access bypass (Image module - Drupal 7)

Drupal core provides the ability to have private files, including images. A
vulnerability was identified in which derivative images (which Drupal
automatically creates from these images based on "image styles" and which may
differ, for example, in size or saturation) did not always receive the same
protection. Under some circumstances, this would allow users to access image
derivatives for images they should not be able to view.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only affects sites which
use the Image module and which store images in a private file system.

CVE: Requested.

-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED

  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.19.

-------- SOLUTION

    modules was reported by t.ashula, and by David Rothstein [7] of the Drupal
    Security Team.
  * The access bypass issue in the Book module was reported by Mark Lindsey
    [8].
  * The access bypass issue in the Drupal 7 Image module was reported by
    Kressin Roger [9], Christian Johansson [10], Anders Olsson [11] and
    saschadrupal [12].

    [17], Greg Knaddison [18], David Rothstein [19] and Damien Tournoud [20]
    of the Drupal Security Team.

I'm splitting this one since it's a vuln in Drupal and another in jQuery.

A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) was identified in
certain Drupal JavaScript functions that pass unexpected user input
into jQuery causing it to insert HTML into the page when the intended
behavior is to select DOM elements. Multiple core and contributed
modules are affected by this issue.

Please use CVE-2013-0244 for this issue.

jQuery versions 1.6.3 and higher provide protection against common
forms of this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your
site has upgraded to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions
of jQuery that are shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not
contain this protection.

No CVE for this in Drupal as previously discussed. TLDR: no vuln no
CVE, but preventing exploitation of third party components/etc is a
nice and correct thing to do. Assigned a CVE for jQuery 1.6.2 in
previous email.
