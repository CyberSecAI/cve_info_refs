- **Impact of exploitation**:  Exposure of potentially sensitive information logged by the webfs server. This information could include accessed URLs, client IPs, and other details logged by the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the server's file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Any user with local access to the system can read the log file.
