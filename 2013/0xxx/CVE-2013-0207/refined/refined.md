**Summary:**

This CVE ID is assigned to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability found in the "Mark Complete" module for Drupal.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the absence of proper CSRF protection within the "Mark Complete" module. This allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a user without their consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Target Site:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable Drupal site.
*   **Logged-in User:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user of the vulnerable Drupal site to visit the attacker controlled page or click the attacker crafted link.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Request:** The attacker must be able to create a forged HTTP request that exploits the vulnerability.
