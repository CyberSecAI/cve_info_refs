Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-0441:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restriction on which methods within the CORBA component can be serialized. Certain methods were unintentionally allowed to be serialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Serialization Restriction:** The CORBA component lacked proper restrictions on which methods could be serialized. This allowed unintended access to methods that should have been restricted.
*   **Java Sandbox Bypass:** An untrusted Java application or applet, exploiting this lack of restriction, could potentially bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Java Sandbox:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to circumvent Java's security sandbox, gaining unauthorized access to resources and potentially executing arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Untrusted Java Applications/Applets:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker using an untrusted Java application or applet. This could be delivered via a malicious website or a compromised system.
*   **Serialization:** The flaw is present in how the CORBA component handles serialization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to deliver a malicious applet/application:** An attacker would need the ability to execute a malicious applet or application on the victim system. This often involves social engineering to lure users to a compromised site, or tricking a user to run a malicious application.
*   **Network proximity for certain exploitation scenarios:** While not explicitly stated for all attack vectors for this vulnerability, some attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in this family, especially the use of applets, might require network proximity, or at least the applet to be loaded via network.

**Additional Notes:**
* This vulnerability is related to a series of other vulnerabilities found in OpenJDK and Oracle Java.
* Patches for this vulnerability were implemented in IcedTea 6 and 7.
* This issue was often grouped with other Java vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-0424, CVE-2013-0425, CVE-2013-0426, etc.) and patched in batch updates.
* The description from Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2013:0245 provides more comprehensive context.
* The vulnerability is within the CORBA component specifically, affecting how methods are serialized.
* The vulnerability allows a sandbox bypass.

The provided content gives more detail than the official CVE description, clarifying that the flaw existed due to a lack of restriction on serializing certain methods, which could then be abused to bypass Java security restrictions. It also provides detail regarding affected products/versions and various vendor patch information.
