Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an unsupported Real-Time Communication (RTC) sampling rate, specifically a 96kHz render rate, on Mac OS X. The issue arises in the WebRTC audio rendering component of Chrome.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a crash resulting from the use of an unsupported audio sampling rate. This indicates a lack of proper error handling or validation of the sampling rate in the audio rendering logic when used in the WebRTC context on macOS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition, manifested by a crash of the Chrome browser or a specific tab utilizing WebRTC audio functionalities. This would disrupt the user experience and could lead to potential data loss if the application using WebRTC was critical.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves utilizing WebRTC audio in Chrome on a Mac OS X system. The attacker would need to somehow cause the WebRTC client to attempt to render audio at a 96kHz sampling rate. This could be done by manipulating the remote end of a WebRTC session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to manipulate or control the WebRTC audio stream's parameters. This could involve:

- Controlling a remote peer in a WebRTC call.
- Serving malicious content to a user's browser that uses WebRTC audio with the problematic sample rate.
- Potentially using a compromised intermediary to inject the malicious parameter into the WebRTC negotiation.
- The attacker could be positioned remotely, and no local access on the target system would be required.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided information includes a link to a code change ([https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=175323](https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=175323)) that fixes this issue, suggesting that a patch was implemented to prevent crashes when an unsupported sample rate is encountered. The resolution was to avoid the crash when a 96kHz audio rendering rate is requested.
