## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor6 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0907)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes two security issues and
various bugs is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way KVM initialized a guest's registered pv\_eoi
(paravirtualized end-of-interrupt) indication flag when entering the guest.
An unprivileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to crash the
host. (CVE-2013-1935)

A flaw was found in the way unexpected fields in guestInfo dictionaries
were processed. A privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to
make the host the guest is running on unavailable to the management server.
(CVE-2013-0167)

Red Hat would like to thank IBM for reporting the CVE-2013-1935 issue. The
CVE-2013-0167 issue was discovered by Dan Kenigsberg of the Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization team.

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

CVE-2013-1962 (libvirt issue)

CVE-2013-2017 and CVE-2013-1943 (kernel issues)

CVE-2012-6137 (subscription-manager issue)

This update also contains the fixes from the following errata:

* vdsm: RHSA-2013:0886, which adds support for Red Hat Enterprise

Virtualization 3.2 clusters.

* ovirt-node: RHBA-2013:0908

Upgrade Note: If you upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor through the 3.2 Manager administration portal, the Host may
appear with the status of "Install Failed". If this happens, place the host
into maintenance mode, then activate it again to get the host back to an
"Up" state.

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=949981#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-04-09 12:21:40 UTC  ``` A bug has been found in the way guest pv_eoi updates were handled before entering the guests. Upon synchronizing LAPIC to the guest's VAPIC,  kvm_write_guest_cached() (and thus copy_to_user()) could be called with interrupts disabled.  A local unprivileged user in the guest could potentially use this flaw to crash the host.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=949981#c2)  Petr Matousek    2013-04-09 12:33:59 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.  This issue does not affect the versions of KVM package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=949981#c3)  Murray McAllister    2013-06-07 07:21:57 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank IBM for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=949981#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-10 20:49:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2013:0907 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0907.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=949981#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-10 21:51:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0911 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0911.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

This was due to a failure to tear down the snapshot's volume path on the host storage manager prior to merging the snapshot, which left the volume activated on both the storage pool manager and the host storage manager. This update removes unnecessary volume paths and deactivates the snapshot volumes after they are deleted, so virtual machines can run successfully under these conditions. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Clones: | [966085](show_bug.cgi?id=966085 "CLOSED ERRATA - VM no longer bootable after snapshot removal")  ([view as bug list](buglist.cgi?bug_id=966085)) | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2013-06-10 20:49:14 UTC | | | oVirt Team: | Storage | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=962549#c0)  Marina Kalinin    2013-05-13 20:39:36 UTC  ``` Description of problem: VM created from RHEV 2.2 template no longer bootable after snapshot removal on RHEV 3.1.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): rhevm-3.1.0-50.el6ev vdsm-4.9.6-44.2.el6_3 qemu-kvm-rhev-0.12.1.2-2.355.el6_4.3 libvirt-0.10.2-18.el6_4.4  How reproducible: Always on customer environment.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Take a template created on 2.2 with 1 Preallocated disk 2. Create a VM from template (probably on 3.0). 3. Make a snapshot on your VM - snap1. 4. Upgrade your environment to 3.1, so that iSCSI SD will be V3 type. 5. Create new snapshot snap2. 6. Delete snap1. 7. Snapshot deletion operation succeeds.    Actual results: Cannot boot VM.  Expected results: VM should boot successfully.  Additional info: 1. This might be the same issue as on [bug#958242](show_bug.cgi?id=958242), but current description does not match, so opening this bug. 2. No error messages on log, except one time on libvirtd.log: ~~~ 2013-04-29 23:24:12.375+0000: 9466: error : virNetClientProgramDispatchError:174 : Domain not found: no domain with matching uuid '6cfa4510-e859-4f6d-8012-be0d07bc6498' 2013-04-29 23:24:12.376+0000: 9466: debug : virDomainGetXMLDesc:4379 : dom=0x7f36b8017d70, (VM: name=vm_name, uuid=6cfa4510-e859-4f6d-8012-be0d07bc6498), flags=0 2013-04-29 23:24:12.380+0000: 9466: error : virNetClientProgramDispatchError:174 : Domain not found: no domain with matching uuid '6cfa4510-e859-4f6d-8012-be0d07bc6498' 2013-04-29 23:24:12.380+0000: 9466: debug : virDomainFree:2313 : dom=0x7f3730003c00, (VM: name=vm_name, uuid=6cfa4510-e859-4f6d-8012-be0d07bc6498) ~~~  3. Chain on the database is correct and matching the chain on the actual storage: blank <- template(raw) <- base_img (cow) <- current_img (cow). - qemu-img info reports correct chain - all the lvs are present and available - rhev metadata for the chain is correct  Please advise next steps. This occurs to the customer on every single VM matching the scenario. I will provide logs shortly.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=962549#c2)  Marina Kalinin    2013-05-13 20:59:37 UTC  ``` More information:  The template: # qemu-img info /dev/06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0/7bedb639-f146-4ce4-aed8-7a40207467fd image: /dev/06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0/7bedb639-f146-4ce4-aed8-7a40207467fd file format: raw virtual size: 20G (21474836480 bytes) disk size: 0  lvm info:  7bedb639-f146-4ce4-aed8-7a40207467fd 06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0    1 -wi-a---  20.00g  -1  -1 253  18                                                     HwDVAD-irc8-U0sv-q1O3-SzL0-py5n-SKfFRd MD_6,PU_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000,IU_995bd003-f6fb-4faf-a35b-9023df2f299a   dd if=metadata bs=512 skip=6 count=1 DOMAIN=06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0 VOLTYPE=SHARED CTIME=1354408764 FORMAT=RAW IMAGE=995bd003-f6fb-4faf-a35b-9023df2f299a DISKTYPE=1 PUUID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 LEGALITY=LEGAL MTIME=1354408788 POOL_UUID= SIZE=41943040 TYPE=PREALLOCATED DESCRIPTION=_template_4/1/2010 1:26:21 PM_template EOF  Base disk: # qemu-img info /dev/06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0/cb43ac3e-37e5-402c-be6c-fb3346c99dc0 image:  /dev/06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0/cb43ac3e-37e5-402c-be6c-fb3346c99dc0 file format: qcow2 virtual size: 20G (21474836480 bytes) disk size: 0 cluster_size: 65536 backing file:  ../761f0e7f-5c90-409b-89a4-ca86982aed2d/7bedb639-f146-4ce4-aed8-7a40207467fd (actual path:  /dev/06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0/../761f0e7f-5c90-409b-89a4-ca86982aed2d/7bedb639-f146-4ce4-aed8-7a40207467fd)  lvm info:  cb43ac3e-37e5-402c-be6c-fb3346c99dc0 06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0    5 -wi-a---  21.00g  -1  -1 253  20                                                     4Rm132-Wrem-dj8u-9kGc-TR9u-GBuu-ZrpKCS MD_16,IU_761f0e7f-5c90-409b-89a4-ca86982aed2d,PU_7bedb639-f146-4ce4-aed8-7a40207467fd  dd if=metadata bs=512 skip=16 count=1 DOMAIN=06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0 VOLTYPE=INTERNAL CTIME=1354414106 FORMAT=COW IMAGE=761f0e7f-5c90-409b-89a4-ca86982aed2d DISKTYPE=1 PUUID=7bedb639-f146-4ce4-aed8-7a40207467fd LEGALITY=LEGAL MTIME=1367273673 POOL_UUID= DESCRIPTION=_vm_name_11/6/2012 10:59:40 AM TYPE=SPARSE SIZE=41943040 EOF   Last Snapshot: # qemu-img info /dev/06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0/498be3f9-0ab2-4905-9f57-ba53365f5fc4 image: /dev/06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0/498be3f9-0ab2-4905-9f57-ba53365f5fc4 file format: qcow2 virtual size: 20G (21474836480 bytes) disk size: 0 cluster_size: 65536 backing file:  ../761f0e7f-5c90-409b-89a4-ca86982aed2d/cb43ac3e-37e5-402c-be6c-fb3346c99dc0 (actual path:  /dev/06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0/../761f0e7f-5c90-409b-89a4-ca86982aed2d/cb43ac3e-37e5-402c-be6c-fb3346c99dc0)  lvm info:  498be3f9-0ab2-4905-9f57-ba53365f5fc4 06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0    1 -wi-a---   1.00g  -1  -1 253  21                                                     4UrmPb-3ltw-uIuc-Waqm-uJOF-2exS-FmomuC PU_cb43ac3e-37e5-402c-be6c-fb3346c99dc0,MD_109,IU_761f0e7f-5c90-409b-89a4-ca86982aed2d  dd if=metadata bs=512 skip=109 count=1 DOMAIN=06fa7078-fff0-4464-8dc1-d6e541d6c9f0 CTIME=1367273308 FORMAT=COW DISKTYPE=2 LEGALITY=LEGAL SIZE=41943040 VOLTYPE=LEAF DESCRIPTION= IMAGE=761f0e7f-5c90-409b-89a4-ca86982aed2d PUUID=cb43ac3e-37e5-402c-be6c-fb3346c99dc0 MTIME=1367273308 POOL_UUID= TYPE=SPARSE EOF   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=962549#c17)  Lee Yarwood    2013-05-20 08:23:48 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 958242](show_bug.cgi?id=958242) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=962549#c18)  Lee Yarwood    2013-05-20 08:38:24 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 958405](show_bug.cgi?id=958405) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=962549#c19)  Dan Kenigsberg    2013-05-21 09:24:05 UTC  ``` Luckily, we do not have the offending patch <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/13610> in 3.1.z, so no need to clone this bug to there.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=962549#c20)  Michal Skrivanek    2013-05-21 10:34:28 UTC  ``` how did this become 3.1.5 only?

Lee, you are correct. My blaming of change 13610 was premature at best. The passing of objects to teardownVolumePath() (instead of dicts) was introduced back in <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/1123/> which is included in rhev-3.1.4.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=962549#c25)  Ayal Baron    2013-05-23 20:32:31 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 966022](show_bug.cgi?id=966022 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Can't change cd on running vm: unexpected error") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=962549#c26)  Lee Yarwood    2013-05-28 15:01:42 UTC  ``` As requested by QE the steps I used to reproduce this on 3.1.4 are (as listed in comments #9 & #11 ):  - Create a guest on a block storage domain. - Create a snapshot, can be either online or offline. - Run this guest on a HSM host (non SPM). - Shutdown the guest. - Merge the snapshot. - Attempt to run the guest on the same HSM host.

## Topic

Updated vdsm packages that fix one security issue and various bugs are now
available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

VDSM is a management module that serves as a Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager agent on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor or Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts.

A flaw was found in the way unexpected fields in guestInfo dictionaries
were processed. A privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to
make the host the guest is running on unavailable to the management
server. (CVE-2013-0167)

The CVE-2013-0167 issue was discovered by Dan Kenigsberg of the Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization team.

This update also fixes various bugs. Refer to the Technical Notes for
information about these changes:

All users managing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Virtualization hosts using Red
Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager are advised to install these updated
packages, which fix these issues.

These updated packages will be provided to users of Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor in the next rhev-hypervisor6 errata package.
