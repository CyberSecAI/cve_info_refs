  "CVE-2013-0167": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way unexpected fields in guestInfo dictionaries were processed. A privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to make the host the guest is running on unavailable to the management server.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the way unexpected fields in guestInfo dictionaries are processed within the VDSM (Virtual Desktop Server Manager).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation and handling of unexpected dictionary fields."
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit allows a privileged guest user to make the host running the virtual machine unavailable to the management server. This results in a denial of service (DoS) condition for the management server related to the affected host.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious guest user within a virtualized environment. The guest user sends crafted data within the 'guestInfo' dictionary.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a privileged user within a guest operating system, running on a vulnerable host managed by VDSM. They need to be able to send crafted 'guestInfo' dictionaries to the host."
