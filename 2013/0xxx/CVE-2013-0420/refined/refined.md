Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0420:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the DevVGA component of Oracle VirtualBox. Specifically, the loop condition in `DevVGA.cpp` for drawing lines did not account for the `dscan` variable properly, potentially causing it to read or write beyond allocated memory.
*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds read/write.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (DoS), or potentially other unspecified impacts, due to the corruption of memory.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally. An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a guest operating system running on VirtualBox.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the graphical output of the virtualized guest, which can typically be achieved through code execution inside the guest OS. The attacker would need to manipulate the VGA settings/drawing instructions within the virtual machine.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `DevVGA.cpp` file of VirtualBox.
*   The fix involves modifying the loop condition in the DevVGA drawing routine to ensure that it does not access out-of-bounds memory.
*   The original loop condition was: `for(cy = 0; cy < height; cy = cy + (1 << dscan))`.
*   The corrected loop condition is: `for(cy = 0; cy < (height - dscan); cy = cy + (1 << dscan))`.
*   The change ensures that the drawing loop does not proceed beyond the actual height of the display.
*   The `dscan` variable controls the granularity of the drawing operation; the vulnerability occurs when the loop does not consider the `dscan` when iterating through the height of the display.
*   The vulnerability can lead to an out-of-bounds read/write, as a result of the loop potentially continuing beyond the bounds of the allocated memory.

**Affected Products/Versions:**

*   Oracle VirtualBox versions 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 are affected.
*   openSUSE 12.1 and 12.2 are affected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as having a CVSS base score of 2.4, with low impact on confidentiality and integrity, but with a potential for a partial+ impact on availability.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by applying the VirtualBox patch, as indicated in the openSUSE security update.
* The provided Oracle document indicates that this vulnerability is not remotely exploitable without authentication and requires local access.
