Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of information related to CVE-2013-0418:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Oracle Outside In libraries, specifically in the Paradox DB file parser. These libraries are used by Microsoft Exchange Server's WebReady Document Viewing feature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote Code Execution vulnerability: A specially crafted file, when previewed through Outlook Web Access (OWA), can trigger the vulnerability in the Paradox DB parser within the Oracle Outside In libraries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Exchange server.
- The code execution would occur in the security context of the LocalService account, which has minimal privileges on the local computer. Although this account has limited local privileges, it can present anonymous credentials on the network, which can be further exploited.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through email: An attacker sends an email with a specially crafted file (Paradox DB file embedded in a supported file type) to a user on an affected Exchange Server.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the user previews the attachment using the WebReady document viewing feature in OWA.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to users of a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange server.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges on the Exchange server to exploit this vulnerability.
- They need to craft a malicious file that exploits the vulnerability within the Paradox DB parser of Oracle Outside In libraries.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 SP3 and Exchange Server 2010 SP2.
- The vulnerability is addressed by updating the affected Oracle Outside In libraries to a non-vulnerable version.
- The provided documents also mention CVE-2013-0393, a related Denial of Service vulnerability in the same libraries, also triggered by viewing a crafted file.
- A workaround is provided to disable WebReady document view, which would mitigate this vulnerability.
