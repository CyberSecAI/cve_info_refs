## Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Two vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Exchange Server through the WebReady Document Viewing feature. The more severe vulnerability, CVE-2013-0418, could allow remote code execution as the LocalService account if a user views a specially crafted file through Outlook Web Access in a browser. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run code on the affected Exchange Server, but only as the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network. The other vulnerability, CVE-2013-0393, could cause the affected Exchange Server to become unresponsive if a user views a specially crafted file through Outlook Web Access in a browser. Note that CVE-2013-0393 would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights.

To view these vulnerabilities as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-0418](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-0418) and [CVE-2013-0393](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-0393).

#### Mitigating Factors for Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The transcoding service in Exchange that is used for WebReady Document Viewing is running in the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network. This is a mitigating factor for CVE-2013-0418.

#### Workarounds for Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable WebReady document view**

  1. Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.
  2. Issue the following PowerShell command:

     ```
     Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | where {$_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2007' -or $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2010'} |
     Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled:$False WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled:$False

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** OWA users may not be able to preview the content of email attachments.

  **How do I undo the workaround?**

  1. Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.
  2. Issue the following PowerShell command:

     ```
     Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | where {$_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2007' -or $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2010'} |
     Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled:$True -
     WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled:$True

     ```

     **Note** The above steps assume the Exchange Administrator had previously allowed WebReady Documents to be viewed on both Public and Private logons to OWA. The appropriate $True or $False value should be used to set the desired behavior based upon user logon.

#### FAQ for Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities

**What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?**

Two vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Exchange Server through the WebReady Document Viewing feature. The more severe vulnerability, CVE-2013-0418, is a remote code execution vulnerability. The other vulnerability, CVE-2013-0393, is a denial of service vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerabilities?**

The WebReady service parses files using the Oracle Outside In libraries in order to provide a preview of the document in the browser. The vulnerabilities are caused when WebReady Document Viewer is used to preview a specially crafted file.

The mapping of CVE identifiers to the vulnerable file parsers are as follows:

| CVE Identifier | Affected File Parser |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2013-0418 | Paradox DB |
| CVE-2013-0393 | Paradox DB |

**Microsoft** **Exchange Server does not list Paradox database as a supported** **file type for rendering in OWA. Do I** **still need to apply this update?**

Yes. An attacker could send an email message that includes a Paradox Database as an embedded attachment in a file type supported by Exchange.

**What are the Oracle Outside In libraries?**

In Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, Outlook Web App (OWA) users are provided with a feature called WebReady Document Viewing that allows users to view certain attachments as a webpage instead of relying on local applications to open/view it. The Oracle Outside In libraries are used by the conversion process in the server backend to support the WebReady feature. Microsoft licenses these libraries from Oracle.

**What is WebReady Document Viewing?**

WebReady Document Viewing allows users to view certain attachments as a webpage. Microsoft Exchange 2007 and Microsoft Exchange 2010 do the conversion, so the user doesn't need anything other than a web browser.

**What might an attacker use these vulnerabilities to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited CVE-2013-0418 could run arbitrary code as LocalService on the affected Exchange server. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or take any other action that the server process has access to do. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

An attacker who successfully exploited CVE-2013-0393 could cause the affected Exchange Server to become unresponsive if a user views a specially crafted file through Outlook Web Access in a browser. Note that CVE-2013-0393 would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit these vulnerabilities?**

An attacker could send an email message containing a specially crafted file to a user on an affected version of Exchange. The vulnerabilities could be exploited when the user previews the specially crafted file in the browser.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerabilities?**

Exchange server systems are primarily at risk from these vulnerabilities.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by updating the affected Oracle Outside In libraries to a non-vulnerable version.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had these vulnerabilities been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. These vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed. They have been assigned the following Common Vulnerability and Exposure numbers:

* [CVE-2013-0393](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-0393)
* [CVE-2013-0418](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-0418)

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that these vulnerabilities were being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft Exchange hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Setup Modes |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| \*\*/q[n | b | r | f] or /quiet\*\* | Sets user interface level. n - No user interaction b - Basic user interaction r - Reduced user interaction f - Full user interaction (default) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Restart Options |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Logging Options |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| \*\*/l[i | w | e | a | r | u | c | m | o | p | v | x | + | ! | \*] <LogFile>\*\* | i - Status messages w - Nonfatal warnings e - All error messages a - Start up of actions r - Action-specific records u - User requests c - Initial UI parameters m - Out-of-memory or fatal exit information o - Out-of-disk-space messages p - Terminal properties v - Verbose output x - Extra debugging information + - Append to existing log file ! - Flush each line to the log \* - Log all information, except for v and x options |
| **/log<LogFile>** | Equivalent of /l\* <LogFile> |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

### Other Information

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2013

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 86 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2013 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1502461.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=72843853414564&id=1502461.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=73077062958332&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
