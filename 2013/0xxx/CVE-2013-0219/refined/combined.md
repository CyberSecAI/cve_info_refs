# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

## Synopsis

Low: sssd security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0508)

## Topic

Updated sssd packages that fix two security issues, multiple bugs, and add
various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) provides a set of daemons to
manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It
provides an NSS and PAM interface toward the system and a pluggable
back-end system to connect to multiple different account sources. It is
also the basis to provide client auditing and policy services for projects
such as FreeIPA.

A race condition was found in the way SSSD copied and removed user home
directories. A local attacker who is able to write into the home directory
of a different user who is being removed could use this flaw to perform
symbolic link attacks, possibly allowing them to modify and delete
arbitrary files with the privileges of the root user. (CVE-2013-0219)

Multiple out-of-bounds memory read flaws were found in the way the autofs
and SSH service responders parsed certain SSSD packets. An attacker could
spend a specially-crafted packet that, when processed by the autofs or SSH
service responders, would cause SSSD to crash. This issue only caused a
temporary denial of service, as SSSD was automatically restarted by the
monitor process after the crash. (CVE-2013-0220)

The CVE-2013-0219 and CVE-2013-0220 issues were discovered by Florian
Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.

These updated sssd packages also include numerous bug fixes and
enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Technical
Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
of these changes.

All SSSD users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
upgrade SSSD to upstream version 1.9 to correct these issues, fix these
bugs and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=902716#c0)  Nikolai Kondrashov    2013-01-22 10:28:39 UTC  ``` Description of problem: SSSD doesn't notice rule becoming a mismatch immediately, but only after a smart refresh on ppc64 and s390x with directory server running on x86_64.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): sssd-client-1.9.2-74.el6.s390x libsss_idmap-1.9.2-74.el6.s390x libsss_sudo-1.9.2-74.el6.s390x sssd-1.9.2-74.el6.s390x  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Setup LDAP directory, using the attached mismatch_refresh_test.ldif file as reference. 2. Setup SSSD client using the attached sssd.conf as reference. 3. Execute the following, replacing the server hostname: ---:<--- service sssd restart >/dev/null ldapmodify -h dell-pe840-01.rhts.eng.bos.redhat.com -x -D cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com -w Secret123 <<<" dn: cn=test,ou=Sudoers,dc=example,dc=com replace: sudoUser sudoUser: user2" >/dev/null su -c 'sudo -u user2 true' user1 && echo ALLOWED || echo DENIED sleep 11 su -c 'sudo -u user2 true' user1 && echo ALLOWED || echo DENIED --->:---  Actual results: ALLOWED user1 is not allowed to run sudo on ibm-z10-02.  This incident will be reported. DENIED  Expected results: user1 is not allowed to run sudo on ibm-z10-02.  This incident will be reported. DENIED user1 is not allowed to run sudo on ibm-z10-02.  This incident will be reported. DENIED  Additional info: This works as documented on x86_64 and i386.  Use the following command for test teardown, replacing the server hostname: ---:<--- ldapmodify  -h dell-pe840-01.rhts.eng.bos.redhat.com -x -D cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com -w Secret123 <<<" dn: cn=test,ou=Sudoers,dc=example,dc=com replace: sudoUser sudoUser: user1" >/dev/null --->:---   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=902716#c1)  Nikolai Kondrashov    2013-01-22 10:29:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 685018](attachment.cgi?id=685018 "mismatch_refresh_test.ldif") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=685018&action=edit "mismatch_refresh_test.ldif") mismatch_refresh_test.ldif   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=902716#c2)  Nikolai Kondrashov    2013-01-22 10:30:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 685019](attachment.cgi?id=685019 "sssd.conf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=685019&action=edit "sssd.conf") sssd.conf   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=902716#c3)  Nikolai Kondrashov    2013-01-22 10:32:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 685034](attachment.cgi?id=685034 "mismatch_refresh_test.ldif") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=685034&action=edit "mismatch_refresh_test.ldif") mismatch_refresh_test.ldif   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=902716#c5)  Nikolai Kondrashov    2013-01-22 10:51:39 UTC  ``` I'd say this bug could lead to a security issue, where an administrator would expect access right revocation to become effective immediately on ppc64 or s390x, similarly to what happens on i386 or x86_64, and not only after smart refresh interval, which could be set noticeably long.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=902716#c6)  Pavel Březina    2013-01-22 11:49:21 UTC  ``` Upstream ticket: <https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/1779>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=902716#c7)  Pavel Březina    2013-01-22 11:53:55 UTC  ``` Hi, can you please attach logs? Also, would you be so kind as to prepare me test environment on these architectures? Thanks.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=902716#c8)  Jakub Hrozek    2013-01-22 12:10:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=902716#c7)) > Hi, > can you please attach logs? Also, would you be so kind as to prepare me test > environment on these architectures? Thanks.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

#### #1782 TOCTOU race conditions by copying and removing directory trees Closed: Fixed None Opened 12 years ago by jhrozek.

Closed: Fixed
Reopen Issue

A TOCTOU (time-of-check time-of-use) race condition was found in the way SSSD, System Security Services Daemon, performed copying and removal of (user) directory trees.A local attacker, with permissions to write into directory of the victim, being actively / currently copied / removed via the sssd daemon facility, could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, leading to their ability to alter / remove directories outside of originally intended, to be modified, directory tree.

This issue was found by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security Team.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

## Topic

Updated sssd packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

SSSD (System Security Services Daemon) provides a set of daemons to manage
access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It provides NSS
(Name Service Switch) and PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) interfaces
toward the system and a pluggable back end system to connect to multiple
different account sources.

A race condition was found in the way SSSD copied and removed user home
directories. A local attacker who is able to write into the home directory
of a different user who is being removed could use this flaw to perform
symbolic link attacks, possibly allowing them to modify and delete
arbitrary files with the privileges of the root user. (CVE-2013-0219)

The CVE-2013-0219 issue war discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat
Product Security Team.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* After a paging control was used, memory in the sssd\_be process was never

freed which led to the growth of the sssd\_be process memory usage over
time. To fix this bug, the paging control was deallocated after use, and
thus the memory usage of the sssd\_be process no longer grows. (BZ#820908)

* If the sssd\_be process was terminated and recreated while there were

authentication requests pending, the sssd\_pam process did not recover
correctly and did not reconnect to the new sssd\_be process. Consequently,
the sssd\_pam process was seemingly blocked and did not accept any new
authentication requests. The sssd\_pam process has been fixes so that it
reconnects to the new instance of the sssd\_be process after the original
one terminated unexpectedly. Even after a crash and reconnect, the sssd\_pam
process now accepts new authentication requests. (BZ#882414)

* When the sssd\_be process hung for a while, it was terminated and a new

instance was created. If the old instance did not respond to the TERM
signal and continued running, SSSD terminated unexpectedly. As a
consequence, the user could not log in. SSSD now keeps track of sssd\_be
subprocesses more effectively, making the restarts of sssd\_be more reliable
in such scenarios. Users can now log in whenever the sssd\_be is restarted
and becomes unresponsive. (BZ#886165)

* In case the processing of an LDAP request took longer than the client

timeout upon completing the request (60 seconds by default), the PAM client
could have accessed memory that was previously freed due to the client
timeout being reached. As a result, the sssd\_pam process terminated
unexpectedly with a segmentation fault. SSSD now ignores an LDAP request
result when it detects that the set timeout of this request has been
reached. The sssd\_pam process no longer crashes in the aforementioned
scenario. (BZ#923813)

* When there was a heavy load of users and groups to be saved in cache,

SSSD experienced a timeout. Consequently, NSS did not start the backup
process properly and it was impossible to log in. A patch has been provided
to fix this bug. The SSSD daemon now remains responsive and the login
continues as expected. (BZ#805729)

* SSSD kept the file descriptors to the log files open. Consequently, on

occasions like moving the actual log file and restarting the back end, SSSD
still kept the file descriptors open. SSSD now closes the file descriptor
after the child process execution; after a successful back end start, the
file descriptor to log files is closed. (BZ#961680)

* While performing access control in the Identity Management back end, SSSD

erroneously downloaded the "member" attribute from the server and then
attempted to use it in the cache verbatim. Consequently, the cache
attempted to use the "member" attribute values as if they were pointing to
the local cache which was CPU intensive. The member attribute when
processing host groups is no longer downloaded and processed. Moreover, the
login process is reasonably fast even with large host groups. (BZ#979047)

All sssd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

The users saw the CPU spiking up. Fix: We no longer download and process the member attribute when processing host groups Result: The login process is reasonably fast even with large host groups. | | | Clone Of: | [979046](show_bug.cgi?id=979046 "CLOSED ERRATA - sssd_be goes to 99% CPU and causes significant login delays when client is under load") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2013-09-30 22:46:09 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | | [Dependent Products:](page.cgi?id=fields.html#dependent_products "Other Products that are affected by this bug.") | Red Hat Developer Toolset Red Hat OpenStack Red Hat Software Collections | |

The sssd.log shows a reoccurring number of messages stating:  A service PING timed out on [domain.com]. Attempt [0]  Followed by: Killing service [expertcity.com], not responding to pings!  Following a restart of sssd, the sssd_be process spikes at 99% cpu, and a delay of 30-60secs can be experienced sshing to the device.  Subsequent logins seem fine until whichever cache is effected needs to be renewed again, which in turn reproduces the long delay.  The system is a VM with 2 cores assigned.  Load can be anywhere from 4-12 to reproduce the issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=979047#c1)  RHEL Program Management    2013-06-27 13:38:24 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux release.  Product Management has requested further review of this request by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux release for currently deployed products.  This request is not yet committed for inclusion in a release.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=979047#c2)  Jakub Hrozek    2013-06-27 14:51:54 UTC  ``` Steps to reproduce: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=979045#c2](show_bug.cgi?id=979045#c2 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - sssd_be goes to 99% CPU and causes significant login delays when client is under load")   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=979047#c3)  Jakub Hrozek    2013-06-27 14:52:34 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=979047#c5)  Namita Soman    2013-08-01 17:41:14 UTC  ``` Tested using ipa-server-3.0.0-26.el6_4.4.x86_64, sssd-1.5.1-70.el5, ipa-client-2.1.3-7.el5  Added a host group - hostgroup1 Added 2000 hosts Added these hosts to the hostgroup Installed ipaclient, and added that host to same hostgroup Added hbac rule, allowing user (user one) to access hosts in the hostgroup (hostgroup1), and allowing access to a service (sshd). Disabled hbac rule allow_all  Ran kdestroy ssh'd as user (one) from master server to the host where the rhel 5.10 client is installed.  There was no cpu spikes or messages in sssd.log   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=979047#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-09-30 22:46:09 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
