Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2013-0219:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition exists in how SSSD (System Security Services Daemon) handles the copying and removal of user directory trees.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **TOCTOU race condition**: The vulnerability arises because SSSD checks the state of the directory and acts upon it in two separate steps, allowing an attacker to modify it in between. Specifically, the attacker can modify the directory between the check (time-of-check) and the use (time-of-use).
- **Symbolic link attacks:**  An attacker can exploit the TOCTOU by creating symbolic links within a user's home directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file modification/deletion:** A successful attack could allow a local user to modify or delete arbitrary files with the privileges of the root user, outside of the intended directory tree.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While the initial access is local with the permissions of the victim, the exploitation leads to root-level privileges, effectively escalating the attacker's privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local attack:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Write permissions:** The attacker must be able to write to a directory that SSSD is in the process of copying or removing, which is typically the user's home directory of a different user, during a user removal operation.
- **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker manipulates the directory to include malicious symbolic links.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker must have a local account on the system.
- **Write access:**  The attacker must be able to write within a directory that SSSD is actively managing via copy or removal operations.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to time the malicious modifications within the race condition window.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects SSSD versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, as well as Fedora releases 16, 17, and EPEL 5.
- The issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security Team.
- Patches were released in RHSA-2013:0508 (RHEL 6) and RHSA-2013:1319 (RHEL 5) as well as other Fedora updates.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "low" security impact by Red Hat, but still provides a way for local users to perform actions outside of what they should be allowed to do.
