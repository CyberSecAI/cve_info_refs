# CVE-2013-0251

| **Name** | CVE-2013-0251 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Stack-based buffer overflow in llogincircuit.cc in latd 1.25 through 1.30 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long string in the llogin version. |

All versions from 1.25 to 1.30 contain the bug. I've inspected the
code to find out whether the pkgsrc package version has it and to
write a proper pkg-vulnerabilities database entry.

latd has a buffer overflow vulnerability @ llogincircuit.cc

    case LATCP_VERSION:
        if (strcmp(VERSION, (char*)cmdbuf) == 0)
        {
            state = RUNNING; // Versions match
            send_reply(LATCP_VERSION, VERSION, -1);
        }

            debuglog(("Connect from invalid llogin version %s\n", cmdbuf));
            sprintf(error, "llogin version %s does not match latd version " VERSION, cmdbuf); //***** overflow here

This vulnerability can trigger arbitrary code execution for an unprivileged
user. I am attaching an example payload that crashes latd daemon.

```
Hi Christine

I noticed you already uploaded 1.31 fixing #699625 which is great,
thanks for working on this issue and fixing it already.

There is however one unfortunate thing:

 91 files changed, 28516 insertions(+), 2085 deletions(-)

This is a problem as the fix needs to go to testing too, but we are in
Freeze for wheezy now so the freeze policy[1] applies.

 [1]: <http://release.debian.org/wheezy/freeze_policy.html>

Could you isolate the fix needed and only perform a minimal update to
the package in regard to the version in testing? 1.30. I guess the
release team would like to see the changes reverted and have only the
bug fixed at this stage of the freeze.

I assue the only needed change is the following (only shortly looked
at the debdiff)?

Hi,

I browsed the source archives of latd because pkgsrc still has latd 1.18,
and found that all version between and including 1.25 and 1.30 have the
bug. I wonder if that information is useful to others...

Btw, why not change the sprintf to

snprintf(error, sizeof(error),
	"llogin version %s does not match latd version " VERSION, cmdbuf);

instead of arbitrarily limiting cmdbuf to 900 characters, which might
be too long if somebody in the future shortened the buffer error or
passed in a much longer VERSION from the Makefile?

Do we want to avoid snprintf()?

Explicit

1024 - sizeof("llogin version  does not match latd version " VERSION)
looks complicated, but makes the size requirement openly visible, and
should be optimizable by modern compilers.

Regards,
	-is

```

Sorry, my mistake.

I'll do another upload later today with only that patch, then another
one to fix the lintian bugs later in the week. TBH most of that diff was
a sill yautoconf-generated file!

Thank you for the quick reply! Btw, could you then also ask for the
unblock to the release team? It should appear on their radar anyway as
it's RC bug, but I think it's appreciated on their side.

Hi

One further follow up: The Security Team marked the issue as no-dsa in
the Security-Tracker[1]. So an update for Squeeze might go trough a p-u
upload.

 [1] <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0251>

Thanks for fixing this issue quickly!

Regards,
Salvatore
