Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Drupal core handles derivative images generated from private files using the Image module. Specifically, derivative images did not consistently receive the same access protection as their original counterparts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Access Bypass:** The primary weakness is an access control bypass, allowing unauthorized users to view derivative images (e.g., resized or modified versions) of private images.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker could potentially access private image files by requesting their derivatives, which they should not have access to, thus leading to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information if the images themselves contain such data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by requesting derivative images of private files.
*   The attack vector is through the web interface, by directly requesting image derivatives that should have been protected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a user who can access the website, but does not have permission to access the private original image.
*   The attacker must be able to craft requests for specific derivative image URLs.
*   The site must be using the Drupal Image module with images stored in a private file system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Drupal 7.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated in Drupal 7.19
*   The vulnerability was reported by Kressin Roger, Christian Johansson, Anders Olsson and saschadrupal.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by Heine Deelstra of the Drupal Security Team and by Anders Olsson.
