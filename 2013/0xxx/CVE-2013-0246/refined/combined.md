# [Security-news] SA-CORE-2013-001 - Drupal core - Multiple vulnerabilities

---

*From*: security-news () drupal org

*Date*: Wed, 16 Jan 2013 22:32:47 +0000 (UTC)

View online: <http://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-001>

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CORE-2013-001
  * Project: Drupal core [1]
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-January-16
  * Security risk: Highly critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in the supported Drupal core versions 6
and 7.

.... Cross-site scripting (Various core and contributed modules - Drupal 6
      and 7)

A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) was identified in
certain Drupal JavaScript functions that pass unexpected user input into
jQuery causing it to insert HTML into the page when the intended behavior is
to select DOM elements. Multiple core and contributed modules are affected by
this issue.

jQuery versions 1.6.3 and higher provide protection against common forms of
this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your site has upgraded
to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions of jQuery that are
shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not contain this protection.

Although the fix added to Drupal as part of this security release prevents
the most common forms of this issue in the same way as newer versions of
jQuery do, developers should be aware that passing untrusted user input
directly to jQuery functions such as jQuery() and $() is unsafe and should be
avoided.

CVE: Requested.

.... Access bypass (Book module printer friendly version - Drupal 6 and 7)

A vulnerability was identified that exposes the title or, in some cases, the
content of nodes that the user should not have access to.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the bypass is only
accessible to users who already have the 'access printer-friendly version'
permission (which is not granted to Anonymous or Authenticated users by
default) and it only affects nodes that are part of a book outline.

CVE: Requested.

.... Access bypass (Image module - Drupal 7)

Drupal core provides the ability to have private files, including images. A
vulnerability was identified in which derivative images (which Drupal
automatically creates from these images based on "image styles" and which may
differ, for example, in size or saturation) did not always receive the same
protection. Under some circumstances, this would allow users to access image
derivatives for images they should not be able to view.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only affects sites which
use the Image module and which store images in a private file system.

CVE: Requested.

-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.28.
  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.19.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Drupal core 6.28 [4].
  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Drupal core 7.19 [5].

Also see the Drupal core [6] project page.

-------- REPORTED BY
---------------------------------------------------------

  * The cross-site scripting issue in various Drupal core and contributed
    modules was reported by t.ashula, and by David Rothstein [7] of the Drupal
    Security Team.
  * The access bypass issue in the Book module was reported by Mark Lindsey
    [8].
  * The access bypass issue in the Drupal 7 Image module was reported by
    Kressin Roger [9], Christian Johansson [10], Anders Olsson [11] and
    saschadrupal [12].

-------- FIXED BY
------------------------------------------------------------

  * The cross-site scripting issue in various Drupal core and contributed
    modules was fixed by t.ashula, Théodore Biadala [13], Katherine Bailey
    [14], Steve De Jonghe [15] and J. Renée Beach [16], and by Dylan Tack
    [17], Greg Knaddison [18], David Rothstein [19] and Damien Tournoud [20]
    of the Drupal Security Team.
  * The access bypass issue in the Book module was fixed by Mark Lindsey [21],
    and by Fox [22], David Rothstein [23] and Peter Wolanin [24] of the Drupal
    Security Team.
  * The access bypass issue in the Drupal 7 Image module was fixed by Heine
    Deelstra [25] of the Drupal Security Team, and by Anders Olsson [26].

-------- COORDINATED BY
------------------------------------------------------

  * David Rothstein [27], Gábor Hojtsy [28], Stéphane Corlosquet [29], Greg
    Knaddison [30], Heine Deelstra [31] and Peter Wolanin [32] of the Drupal
    Security Team
  * Jeremy Thorson [33] of the QA/Testing Infrastructure Team

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I'm splitting this one since it's a vuln in Drupal and another in jQuery.

A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) was identified in
certain Drupal JavaScript functions that pass unexpected user input
into jQuery causing it to insert HTML into the page when the intended
behavior is to select DOM elements. Multiple core and contributed
modules are affected by this issue.

Please use CVE-2013-0244 for this issue.

jQuery versions 1.6.3 and higher provide protection against common
forms of this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your
site has upgraded to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions
of jQuery that are shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not
contain this protection.

No CVE for this in Drupal as previously discussed. TLDR: no vuln no
CVE, but preventing exploitation of third party components/etc is a
nice and correct thing to do. Assigned a CVE for jQuery 1.6.2 in
previous email.
