## Binary packages built by this source

[bsdcpio](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/bsdcpio):
Implementation of the 'cpio' program from FreeBSD

The bsdcpio program is the default system 'cpio' program used on FreeBSD.

 bsdcpio uses the libarchive library as a backend which does all of the work for

 reading and writing archives in various formats.

[bsdtar](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/bsdtar):
Implementation of the 'tar' program from FreeBSD

The bsdtar program is the default system 'tar' program used on FreeBSD. bsdtar

 uses the libarchive library as a backend which does all of the work for reading

 and writing archives in various formats.

[libarchive-dev](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libarchive-dev):
Multi-format archive and compression library (development files)

The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing

 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports

 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such

 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially

 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.

 .

 Archive formats supported are:

 .

    \* tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)

    \* pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)

    \* cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants)

    \* iso9660 (read only, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with some

      limitations)

    \* zip (read only, with some limitations, uses zlib)

    \* mtree (read and write)

    \* shar (write only)

    \* ar (read and write, including BSD and GNU/SysV variants)

    \* empty (read only; in particular, note that no other format will accept an

      empty file)

    \* raw (read only)

    \* xar (read only)

    \* rar (read only, with some limitations)

    \* 7zip (read and write, with some limitations)

 .

 Filters supported are:

 .

    \* gzip (read and write, uses zlib)

    \* bzip2 (read and write, uses bzlib)

    \* compress (read and write, uses an internal implementation)

    \* uudecode (read only)

    \* separate command-line compressors with fixed-signature auto-detection

    \* xz and lzma (read and write using liblzma)

 .

 This package provides the files necessary for development with libarchive.

[libarchive12](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libarchive12):
Multi-format archive and compression library (shared library)

The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing

 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports

 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such

 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially

 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.

 .

 Archive formats supported are:

 .

    \* tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)

    \* pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)

    \* cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants)

    \* iso9660 (read only, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with some

      limitations)

    \* zip (read only, with some limitations, uses zlib)

    \* mtree (read and write)

    \* shar (write only)

    \* ar (read and write, including BSD and GNU/SysV variants)

    \* empty (read only; in particular, note that no other format will accept an

      empty file)

    \* raw (read only)

    \* xar (read only)

    \* rar (read only, with some limitations)

    \* 7zip (read and write, with some limitations)

 .

 Filters supported are:

 .

    \* gzip (read and write, uses zlib)

    \* bzip2 (read and write, uses bzlib)

    \* compress (read and write, uses an internal implementation)

    \* uudecode (read only)

    \* separate command-line compressors with fixed-signature auto-detection

    \* xz and lzma (read and write using liblzma)

 .

 This package provides the libarchive shared library.

FreeBSD-SA-16:23.libarchive Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Buffer overflow in libarchive(3)
Category: contrib
Module: libarchive
Announced: 2016-05-31
Affects: FreeBSD 9.3
Corrected: 2016-05-21 09:27:30 UTC (stable/9, 9.3-STABLE)
2016-05-31 16:23:56 UTC (releng/9.3, 9.3-RELEASE-p43)
CVE Name: CVE-2013-0211
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The libarchive(3) library provides a flexible interface for reading and
writing streaming archive files such as tar and cpio, and has been the
basis for FreeBSD's implementation of the tar(1) and cpio(1) utilities
since FreeBSD 5.3.
II. Problem Description
An integer signedness error in the archive\_write\_zip\_data() function in
archive\_write\_set\_format\_zip.c in libarchive(2) could lead to a buffer
overflow on 64-bit machines.
III. Impact
An attacker who can provide input of their choice for creating a ZIP archive
can cause a buffer overflow in libarchive(2) that results in a core dump or
possibly execution of arbitrary code provided by the attacker.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available but 32-bit systems are not vulnerable.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Reboot is not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
A reboot is not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:23/libarchive.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:23/libarchive.patch.asc
# gpg --verify libarchive.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/9/ r300363
releng/9.3/ r301044
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=902998#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-22 22:03:23 UTC  ``` Fabian Yamaguchi reported a read buffer overflow flaw in libarchive on 64-bit systems where sizeof(size_t) is equal to 8.  In the archive_write_zip_data() function in libarchive/archive_write_set_format_zip.c, the "s" parameter is of type size_t (64 bit, unsigned) and is cast to a 64 bit signed integer.  If "s" is larger than MAX_INT, it will not be set to "zip->remaining_data_bytes" even though it is larger than "zip->remaining_data_bytes", which leads to a buffer overflow when calling deflate().  This can lead to a segfault in an application that uses libarchive to create ZIP archives.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=902998#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-22 22:05:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 685479](attachment.cgi?id=685479&action=diff "proposed upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=685479&action=edit "proposed upstream patch") proposed upstream patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=902998#c2)  Huzaifa S.

This prevents a certain common programming error (passing -1 to write)
from leading to other problems deeper in the library.

# USN-2549-1: libarchive vulnerabilities

25 March 2015

libarchive could be made to crash or overwrite files.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libarchive](/security/cves?package=libarchive) - Library to read/write archive files

## Details

It was discovered that the libarchive bsdcpio utility extracted absolute

paths by default without using the --insecure flag, contrary to

expectations. If a user or automated system were tricked into extracting

cpio archives containing absolute paths, a remote attacker may be able to

write to arbitrary files. ([CVE-2015-2304](/security/CVE-2015-2304))

Fabian Yamaguchi discovered that libarchive incorrectly handled certain

type conversions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

libarchive to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-0211](/security/CVE-2013-0211))

  -
  [3.1.2-7ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libarchive/3.1.2-7ubuntu2.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [bsdcpio](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libarchive)
  -
  [3.0.3-6ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libarchive/3.0.3-6ubuntu1.1)
* [libarchive12](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libarchive)
  -
  [3.0.3-6ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libarchive/3.0.3-6ubuntu1.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=800024#c0)  Sebastian Krahmer   2013-01-23 08:06:20 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED, via private distros list.  However as it seems the overflow only happens when writing files. It is a rather uncommon case to control size arguments there in a service/suid that is using libarchive. Therefore I think its sufficient to fix Factory.  From: Fabian Yamaguchi To: distros   Hello,  I would like to report a buffer overflow in libarchive, which can be triggered on 64 bit systems where sizeof(size_t) is 8. In function archive_write_zip_data in libarchive/archive_write_set_format_zip.c, the parameter "s" of type size_t (64 bit, unsigned) is cast to a signed 64 bit integer before comparing to "zip->remaining_data_bytes" on line 402. If "s" is larger than MAX_INT, "(int64_t)s > zip->remaining_data_bytes)" will always be false. In consequence, "s" will not be set to "zip->remaining_data_bytes" eventhough it is larger than "zip->remaining_data_bytes". This leads to a buffer-overflow when calling "deflate" on line 421.  The relevant code snippet, a small c program to trigger the issue and a debug trace have been attached. Personally, I think this bug is rather moderate in severity since it requires a privileged program using libarchive, which allows negative values to be passed to the library function "archive_write_data".

Here is his reply.  I tend to agree with his analysis that this is a minor issue as it can only cause the calling process to crash, at best.  Should we just consider this as a normal bugfix?  The proposed fix is not yet committed to any public repository but we plan to do it on Wednesday if nobody objects.  ===  It looks very minor to me, since:    * archive_write_header is declared to take an unsigned size_t      argument.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that gcc -Wall      complains about the signed/unsigned mismatch.      (Passing a literal negative value to an unsigned argument      seems worth at least a warning to me.)    * It's a read buffer overflow, not a write overflow, so I don't      think it's exploitable.    * You can also get a SEGV by calling write(2) with      a size argument of -1.  Here's one possible fix.   Note that archive_write_data() is documented to return the number of bytes actually written, so this just puts a limit on the largest write request.
