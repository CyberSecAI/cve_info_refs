  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2013-0315",
    "description": "The GateIn Portal Export / Import Gadget is vulnerable to XXE (XML eXternal Entity) attacks. If the XML provided to the import gadget contains an external XML entity, this XML entity will be resolved. A remote attacker who can access the import gadget could use this flaw to read files in the context of the user running the application server.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The GateIn Portal export/import gadget improperly handles XML data, failing to disable external entity resolution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem, in the context of the user running the application server.",
      "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker who can access the import gadget can inject a malicious XML payload with an external XML entity.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the GateIn Portal import gadget. This means they may need to have network access and potentially authentication to use the gadget."
