________________________________________________________________________
Vendors:            IBM, <http://www.IBM.com>
Product:            Lotus Notes 8.5.3
Vulnerability:      arbitrary code execution
Tracking IDs:       CVE-2013-0127, CERT VU#912420
__________________________________________________________________________
Vendor communication:
2013-02-22: Reported to IBM PSIRT via email
2013-02-25: IBM PSIRT acknowledges the receipt, vulnerability
            details have been forwarded to Notes developers
2013-03-18: Informed CERT of planned advisory date of 2013-04-15
            and asked them to help with coordinated disclosure
2013-03-19: CERT informs IBM as VU#912420
2013-03-25: IBM requests holding off on disclosing the issue
            until a fix is released, which will occur before
            April 30th, 2013.
2013-03-26: n.runs agrees to delay the disclosure
2013-04-30: Coordinated disclosure with CERT and IBM PSIRT
___________________________________________________________________________
Overview:

The Lotus Notes mail client accepts <applet> tags inside HTML emails, making
it possible to load Java applets from a remote location.
Combined with known Java sandbox escape vulnerabilities, it can be used to
fully compromise the user reading the email.

Description:

Notes 8.5.3 does not filter <applet> tags inside HTML emails.
This can be used to load arbitrary Java applets from remote sources (making
it an information disclosure as well as it can be used to trigger an HTTP
request once the mail is previewed/opened).

Notes 8.5.3 FP3 ships with IBM Java 6 SR12 (since November 2012), older
versions may ship with older Java releases.

IBM's Java Security alerts page at
<http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/alerts/>
shows several vulnerabilities with a CVSS score of 10 which have only been
fixed in IBM Java 6 SR13.

This would allow attackers to compromise users reading/previewing an email.

Impact:

Arbitrary code execution as the user is reading the email.

Verification:

Send an email to lotus-notes-java-test () klink name to get an automatic email
back which checks whether Java applets and LiveConnect are enabled. The Java
applet used for testing will not deliver any exploit code but just checks
whether Java applets are loaded correctly.

Fixes:

Execution of Java applets is blocked for emails from the internet in Notes
8.5.3 FP4 Interim Fix 1 and Notes 9.0 Interim Fix 1.
See also <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633819>

Workarounds:

Turn off the execution of Java applets using the EnableJavaApplets=0
directive in notes.ini. It is also recommended to turn off LiveConnect with
EnableLiveConnect=0 as this provides another way to execute Java code even
if EnableJavaApplets is set to zero.

Alternatively, the File -> Preferences -> Basic Notes
Client Preferences GUI can be used to uncheck the Enable Java applets" and
the "Enable Java access from JavaScript" options.

As Java applets are still executed for internal emails, it is strongly
recommended to turn off this feature regardless of the implementation of the
above-mentioned fix.

## IBM Notes runs arbitrary JAVA and Javascript in emails

#### Vulnerability Note VU#912420

Original Release Date: 2013-05-01 | Last Revised: 2014-07-30

---

### Overview

IBM Notes parses arbitrary JAVA and Javascript code by default when viewing emails.

### Description

| The [n.runs AG security advisory](https://www.nruns.com/fileadmin/downloads/advisories/2013/n.runs-SA-2013.005-Lotus_Notes_Java_Applets.txt) states:  *Notes 8.5.3 does not filter <applet> tags inside HTML emails. This can be used to load arbitrary Java applets from remote sources (making it an information disclosure as well as this can be used to trigger an HTTP request once the mail is previewed/opened).*Additional details may be found in the full [n.runs AG security advisory](https://www.nruns.com/fileadmin/downloads/advisories/2013/n.runs-SA-2013.005-Lotus_Notes_Java_Applets.txt). It should also be noted that the IBM JRE that comes with the latest patched version of IBM Notes is [IBM JRE 6 SR12 while IBM JRE 6 SR13](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/alerts/) has been released and includes many security related fixes. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attack may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user viewing emails within IBM Notes. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**[IBM's Security Bulletin](https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633819) states: *The fix will be included in Interim Fix 1 for 8.5.3 Fix Pack 4 and 9.0 Interim Fix 1.* The fix disables loading of JAVA applets for emails that originated from the Internet. Please consider the following workarounds if you are unable to upgrade. We also recommend all users implement the following workarounds if they do not have a need for JAVA & Javascript within Notes. |
| --- |

| The following directives should be set to zero in notes.ini to reduce the attack surface.     + EnableJavaApplets=0 + EnableJavaScript=0 + EnableLiveConnect=0  Although not needed to mitigate this vulnerability, if plugins are not needed we recommend the following directive also be set to zero.    + EnablePlugins=0  Alternatively, in Notes Basic Preferences, deselect the following three preferences:    + Enable Java applets + Enable Java access from JavaScript + Enable JavaScript |
