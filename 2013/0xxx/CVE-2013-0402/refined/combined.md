Alert
# Oracle Has Released Multiple Updates for Java SE

Last RevisedOctober 19, 2016
Alert CodeTA13-107A

### Systems Affected

* JDK and JRE 7 Update 17 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 6 Update 43 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 41 and earlier
* JavaFX 2.2.7 and earlier

### Overview

Oracle has released a Critical Patch Update (CPU) for Java SE. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.

[Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpuapr2013-1928497.html) describes the update:

*A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update and Security Alert. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update and Security Alert advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes.*

Systems administrators are advised to pay additional attention to Oracle advisories due to the increasing volume of vulnerabilities being patched with each release.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or gain unauthorized access to your files or system.

### Solution

**Apply Updates**

[Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpuapr2013-1928497.html) includes the following information:

*Developers can download the latest release from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.*

*Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from http://java.com. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use automatic updates to get the latest release.*

*The latest JavaFX release is included with the latest update of JDK and JRE 7. For JDK and JRE 6 users, the latest Java FX release is available from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/*

# Pwn2Own: Down go all the browsers

In the first day of the Pwn2Own cracking contest, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 10, Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox web browsers have all gone down in flames.
  ![steven-vaughan-nichols](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e27b3953df87b835a77deeeec01f311aa283a5ec/2022/08/05/e2171bd1-84f6-4ca8-9801-2abdeb61a365/steven-vaughan-nichols.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&frame=1&height=192&width=192) Written by [Steven Vaughan-Nichols, Senior Contributing Editor](/meet-the-team/steven-vaughan-nichols/)  March 7, 2013 at 10:20 a.m. PT

In the eternal war between crackers and security professionals, the hackers have won the latest battle.

In ZDI's Pwn2Own hacker competition one browser after another fell.

At the [CanSecWest](http://cansecwest.com) conference in Vancouver, Canada, the HP Zero Day Initiative's (ZDI) [annual Pwn2Own competition](http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/blog/2013/01/17/pwn2own-2013) has ended its first day of competition and [Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) 10, Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox Web browsers have all been cracked](http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Security-Research-Blog/Pwn2Own-2013/ba-p/5981157). In addition, Java—can anyone be surprised at this?--was also cracked multiple times.

[Vupen Security](http://www.vupen.com/english), the French security and hacking company, cracked IE 10. Vupen reported, via Twitter, that they "[pwned MS Surface Pro with two IE10 zero-days](https://twitter.com/VUPEN/status/309479075385327617) to achieve a full Windows 8 compromise with sandbox bypass."

Mind you, no one else had anything to boast about on this day. [Google, which had just fixed numerous security bugs in the Chrome Web browser](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/google-patches-10-chrome-flaws-ahead-pwn2own-pwnium-030513) prior to Pwn2Own, saw Chrome go down as well. MWR Labs, a branch of UK-based [MWR InfoSecurity](http://www.mwrinfosecurity.com/), took down Chrome 25 on Windows 7 by exploiting multiple "zero-day," or unpatched, browser vulnerabilities.

The Chrome crack's authors explained that they'd broken the Web browser by having [Chrome visit a malicious Web page.](http://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/2013/03/06/pwn2own-at-cansecwest-2013) This, in turn, enabled them "to exploit a vulnerability which allowed us to gain code execution in the context of the sand-boxed renderer process. We also used a kernel vulnerability in the underlying operating system [Windows 7] in order to gain elevated privileges and to execute arbitrary commands outside of the sandbox with system privileges."

Vupen struck again and also took out Firefox. Vupen said that they did in Firefox by "using a use-after-free and a [brand new technique to bypass ASLR/DEP](https://twitter.com/VUPEN/status/309505403631325184) [Address Space Layout Randomisation/Data Execution Prevention] on Win7 without the need of any ROP [Return-oriented programming]."

Vupen has not publicly revealed how they did this without using [ROP, perhaps the most common way of exploiting operating systems with  ASLR/DEP protection](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/08/on-the-effectiveness-of-dep-and-aslr.aspx). The company did announce on Twitter, as per the Pwn2Own rules, that "[ALL our 0days & techniques used at #Pwn2ownhave been reported](https://twitter.com/VUPEN/status/309611849765236737) to affected software vendors to allow them [to] issue patches and protect users."

[Java, which has been getting hacked over and over again](/article/apple-hacked-by-same-group-that-attacked-facebook/) recently, fell not once or twice but three times to crackers. [Vupen broke Java by "using a same unique heap overflow as a memory leak](https://twitter.com/VUPEN/status/309506907960401921) to bypass ASLR and as a code execution."

Java was also broken by [Accuvant Labs](http://www.accuvant.com/capability/accuvant-labs) security scientist Joshua Drake and [Context Information Security](http://www.contextis.com/) consultant and vulnerability researcher James Forshaw. Drake appears to have used a similar method to Vupen's in his successful hack, while Forshaw used a "reflection" attack.

Not everything was "pwned" though. No one broke Adobe's Flash Player and Adobe Reader on Windows 7 or Safari on Mac OS X Mountain Lion. Adobe products may yet go down. Vupen is going after Flash today and George Hotz, best known for unlocking Apple's iPhone, is taking on Reader.

It's not all bad news for those who are trying to secure their programs.

In a [ThreatPost](http://threatpost.com/) interview, Chaouki Bekrar, Vupen's CEO and head of research, said, "[Writing exploits in general is getting much harder](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/pwn2own-browser-exploits-getting-harder-more-expensive-find-030613). Java is really easy because there's no sandbox. Flash is a different thing and it's getting updated all the time and Adobe did a very good job securing it. It's more expensive to create a Flash exploit than a Java one. Every time Adobe updates Flash, they're killing bugs and techniques and sandbox bypasses, and honestly, Adobe is doing a great job making it more secure."

As for the browsers in general, Brekar concluded:

> "Chrome is probably the most hard to attack because of the sandbox. The weakness in Chrome is Webkit and the strength is the sandbox. Probably one of the reasons Chrome is so secure is that the Google guys don't just fix vulnerabilities but they're proactive in fixing techniques and sandbox bypasses."

How good is Chrome security really though? We'll find out: In a separate hacking contest, Pwnium 3, [Google is challenging hackers to break into its Linux-based Chrome OS](/article/google-challenges-hackers-to-take-on-chrome-os/) for a a total prize package of $3.14159 million.
