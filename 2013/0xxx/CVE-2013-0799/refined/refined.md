Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows. Specifically, the `GetInstallationDir` function performs an unchecked copy of the provided command-line argument (`argv[2]`) into a fixed-size buffer (`installDir`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking when copying data into the `installDir` buffer.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `maintenanceservice.exe` does not validate the size of its arguments, leading to the overflow.
- **Privileged Service Misconfiguration:** The service is configured to allow unprivileged users to start it with arbitrary arguments, making exploitation easier.
- **Predictable Security Cookie:** While stack-based buffer overflows are often mitigated with security cookies, the generation of the cookie in this case is predictable enough to be bypassed.
- **ASLR and DEP Bypass:** The attacker can bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention) due to predictable DLL base addresses and by using a ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an unprivileged user to execute arbitrary code with the system privileges of the Mozilla Maintenance Service (NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM). This enables the attacker to gain complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File System Access:** The attacker needs local file system access to exploit the vulnerability, as this is required to start the service with manipulated arguments.
- **Manipulated Command-Line Arguments:** The attacker manipulates the `argv[2]` argument passed to the service, causing the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unprivileged Local User:** The attacker must have a user account on the target Windows system.
- **Ability to Start the Service:** The attacker must be able to start the Mozilla Maintenance Service with arbitrary arguments.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Frédéric Hoguin.
- The vulnerable code is in `workmonitor.cpp`, specifically in the `ProcessSoftwareUpdateCommand` and `GetInstallationDir` functions.
- The `installDir` buffer is located 588 bytes before the security cookie, which is used to protect against stack-based buffer overflows.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit was provided, which triggers the vulnerability with a 592-byte long `argv[2]`.
- Patches were created to address the vulnerability by replacing `wcscpy` with `wcsncpy` and initializing buffers to prevent overflows.
- The vulnerability affected Firefox, Firefox ESR, Thunderbird, and Thunderbird ESR.
- The fix was applied in Firefox 20, Firefox ESR 17.0.5, Thunderbird 17.0.5, and Thunderbird ESR 17.0.5.
- The vulnerability is classified as a critical security issue.
