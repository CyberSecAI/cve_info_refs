Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within shortcodes and post content, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in how WordPress handles shortcodes and HTTP POST content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Defacement:** Attackers can alter the appearance and content of the website.
- **Malware Distribution:** Redirect users to malicious websites or trigger downloads of malware.
- **Data Theft:** Potentially steal sensitive information displayed on the page.
- **Site Compromise:** In the worst case, attackers could use these vulnerabilities as a stepping stone to gain full control of the WordPress installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcodes:** Malicious scripts could be injected through specially crafted shortcodes within posts or pages.
- **HTTP POST content:** Scripts could also be injected via user-supplied data in HTTP POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject Content:** Attackers need to be able to contribute content to the WordPress site, such as through comments, post submissions, or manipulating fields that are processed by vulnerable code.
- **No Privileged Access Required:** The vulnerabilities could be exploited by users with low privileges, such as contributors.

**Additional details from provided content:**
- **Specific Fixes:** The provided changeset details show that the fix involves sanitizing gallery shortcode tags and using the correct escaping function `esc_url()` instead of `esc_attr()` for embed links. This indicates the original vulnerability was due to using insufficient escaping methods
- **Affected Versions:** All previous versions of WordPress prior to 3.5.1 are vulnerable.
- **Discovery:** The XSS vulnerabilities were discovered by Jon Cave of the WordPress security team.
- **Red Hat Bugzilla:** Red Hat's bug tracker (bugzilla.redhat.com) confirms the issue and notes the fix in WordPress 3.5.1.
- **Timeline:**  The issue was reported on January 25, 2013 and fixed in WordPress 3.5.1 released on January 24, 2013.
- **Affected Files:** The files changed in the fixes include `wp-includes/media.php` and `wp-includes/class-wp-embed.php`, among others.
