CVE-2013-0499: JavaScript Execution in IBM WebSphere DataPower Services
```

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** JavaScript Execution (Reflected Cross-Site Scripting)
*   **Product:** IBM WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI50
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** 3.8.2, 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 5.0.0
*   **Root Cause:** DataPower services can be configured to echo requests received from the client for debugging purposes. When services like XML Firewall, Multi Protocol Gateway, or Web Service Proxy are configured to echo requests without adequate validation, arbitrary JavaScript embedded in the request can be echoed back to the client. If the client's browser parses the response, the JavaScript code will be executed, leading to a potential security threat. Specifically, the backend can be configured as 'loopback' for XML Firewall service, or by setting the variable “var://service/mpgw/skip-backside” for Multi Protocol Gateway and Web Service Proxy.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a crafted request containing malicious JavaScript code to a DataPower service configured to echo requests.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the client's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a vulnerable DataPower service.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be prevented by disabling the services from blindly echoing requests back. The vendor recommends ensuring that DataPower services running in production environments are not configured to blindly echo requests.

The provided proof of concept uses a PHP script to send a SOAP message containing JavaScript code to a "loopback" Web Service. The service echoes the message back, and the JavaScript code is executed when the response is parsed by a browser.
