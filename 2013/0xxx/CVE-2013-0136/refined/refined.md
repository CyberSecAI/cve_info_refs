Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of directory traversal vulnerabilities in the Mutiny appliance's web interface. Specifically, the `EditDocument` servlet does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for file paths used in `UPLOAD`, `DELETE`, `CUT`, and `COPY` operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The application allows manipulation of file paths using relative path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), enabling access to files and directories outside of the intended upload/document directory (`/var/MUTINY/upload/documents`).
  -   The `uploadPath` parameter in the `UPLOAD` operation.
  -   The `paths[]` parameter in the `DELETE`, `CUT`, and `COPY` operations.
  -   The `newPath` parameter in the `CUT` and `COPY` operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An authenticated attacker can delete any file on the system, including critical system files, potentially causing denial of service.
- **Arbitrary File Copy/Move:** An attacker can copy or move files on the system. This can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data, overwrite existing files, or prepare for further attacks. They can copy files to a web accessible directory for retrieval, like `/usr/jakarta/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/m/` in the provided example.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload files to arbitrary locations on the file system with root privileges. By uploading a JSP file to a web-accessible directory, the attacker can then execute arbitrary code with root privileges by invoking the uploaded JSP through the web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited through specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/interface/EditDocument` servlet.
- **Manipulated Parameters:** The `paths[]`, `newPath`, and `uploadPath` parameters are manipulated to include directory traversal sequences.
- **Multipart Forms:** The `UPLOAD` operation requires a multipart form POST request with a manipulated path and the content of the file to be uploaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid user credentials for the Mutiny appliance's web interface with any of the four access roles (“Super Admin”, “Administrator”, “Engineer” and “View only”).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vendor released version `5.0-1.11 (EAGLe) - (02-05-13)` to address these vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Juan Vazquez of Rapid7.
- The provided information details concrete exploitation examples, including HTTP requests and responses for the `DELETE`, `COPY`, and `UPLOAD` operations.
- The provided information is more detailed than a generic CVE description.
