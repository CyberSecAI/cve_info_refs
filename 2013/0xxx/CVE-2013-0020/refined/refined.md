    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided document describes a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer's CMarkup component (CVE-2013-0020), which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.",
    "details": [
      {
        "vulnerability": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the CMarkup component of Internet Explorer.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises when Internet Explorer attempts to access an object in memory that has already been deleted. This can corrupt memory, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
         "weaknesses": [

        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. With administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system, installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts.",
        "attack_vector": "An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer. The attacker could then convince a user to view this website or use a compromised website that hosts the malicious content.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious webpage. This can be achieved through social engineering tactics, such as embedding a link in an email or instant message."
