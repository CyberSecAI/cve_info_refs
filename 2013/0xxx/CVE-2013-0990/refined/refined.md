- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in SMB file sharing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated users could write files outside the designated shared directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user could potentially write files to arbitrary locations outside the intended shared folder, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of system files.
- **Attack vectors:**  Exploitation occurs via SMB file sharing when enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system with SMB file sharing enabled.
