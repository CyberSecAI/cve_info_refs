**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-0161

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Havalite CMS 1.1.7 application has a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the comments section of blog posts. This is due to the application not properly sanitizing or encoding user-supplied input before displaying it in the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into a comment and is then stored in the database. Subsequently, the code executes when other users view the blog post and comment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

    - Stealing session cookies, which can lead to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Displaying modified page content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "comment" field when submitting a blog post comment. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
