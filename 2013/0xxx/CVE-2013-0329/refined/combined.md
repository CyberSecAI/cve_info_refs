## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0638)

## Topic

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.2, which fixes several security issues, is
now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenShift Enterprise is a cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
solution from Red Hat, and is designed for on-premise or private cloud
deployments.

A flaw was found in the handling of paths provided to ruby193-rubygem-rack.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct a directory traversal
attack by passing malformed requests. (CVE-2013-0262)

A timing attack flaw was found in the way rubygem-rack and
ruby193-rubygem-rack processed HMAC digests in cookies. This flaw could aid
an attacker using forged digital signatures to bypass authentication
checks. (CVE-2013-0263)

It was found that Jenkins did not protect against Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was
logged into Jenkins, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, the attacker
could perform operations on Jenkins. (CVE-2013-0327, CVE-2013-0329)

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Jenkins. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to conduct an XSS attack against users of Jenkins.
(CVE-2013-0328)

A flaw could allow a Jenkins user to build jobs they do not have access to.
(CVE-2013-0330)

A flaw could allow a Jenkins user to cause a denial of service if they
are able to supply a specially-crafted payload. (CVE-2013-0331)

Users are advised to upgrade to Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.2. It is
recommended that you restart your system after applying this update.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2013-02-16

This advisory announces multiple security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.

## Description

One of the vulnerabilities allows [cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) on the Jenkins controller, which causes an user to make unwanted actions on Jenkins.

Another vulnerability enables [cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/), which has the similar consequence.

Another vulnerability allowed an attacker to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism in place, thereby mounting more CSRF attacks. These attacks allow an attacker without direct access to Jenkins to mount an attack.

In the fourth vulnerability, a malicious user of Jenkins can trick Jenkins into building jobs that he does not have direct access to.

And lastly, a vulnerability allows a malicious user of Jenkins to mount a denial of service attack by feeding a carefully crafted payload to Jenkins.

## Severity

The first three vulnerabilities (CSRF and XSS) are rated as **high**, as they allow malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the information and impersonate the administrator of the system. In addition, this allows Jenkins inside a firewall to be attacked from outside. On the other hands, this attack can be only mounted passively, and the attacker needs to know the URL of your Jenkins installations.

The build privilege escalation vulnerability is rated as **medium**, as it requires an attacker to be a valid user of Jenkins with a write access.

The last denial of service attack is rated **low**, as it also requires an attacker to be a valid user of Jenkins with a write access, and this does not result in any data loss nor privilege escalation.

## Fix

* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.502
* LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.3

All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.

As a part of the fix, these versions contain the following incompatible changes. Administrators of Jenkins need to be aware of the following implications of the upgrade:

* JSONP support in [Remote access API](/doc/book/using/remote-access-api/) is removed. If you have other programs that depend on this behavior, you can set the `hudson.model.Api.INSECURE` system property to `true` to resurrect behaviour. However, this is highly discouraged.
* If your Jenkins does not have the security enabled, some of the [Remote access API](/doc/book/using/remote-access-api/) calls that previously didn’t require `POST` now requires it. See the "CSRF Protection" section of the remote access API page for how to add necessary header.

Please use CVE-2013-0328 for this issue.

Please use CVE-2013-0329 for this issue.

Please use CVE-2013-0330 for this issue.

Please use CVE-2013-0331 for this issue.

Since I have to guess I'm splitting them, they can be merged if it later
turns out to be the case.

Again, if you want CVE's for your issues please do not hesitate to
contact me or secalert@...hat.com!

# CloudBees Security Advisory 2013-02-15

This advisory announces multiple security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.

One of the vulnerabilities allows [cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29) on Jenkins master, which causes a user to make unwanted actions on Jenkins. Another vulnerability enables [cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29) , which has a similar consequence. Another vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism in place, thereby mounting more CSRF attackes. These attacks allow an attacker without direct access to Jenkins to mount an attack.

In the fourth vulnerability, a malicious user of Jenkins can trick Jenkins into building jobs that they do not have direct access to.

And lastly, a vulnerability allows a malicious user of Jenkins to mount a denial of service attack by feeding a carefully crafted payload to Jenkins.

### Severity

The first three vulnerabilities (CSRF and XSS) are rated as **high** , as they allow malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the information and impersonate the administrator of the system. In addition, this allows Jenkins inside a firewall to be attacked from outside. On the other hand, this attack can only be mounted passively, and the attacker needs to know the URL of your Jenkins installations.

The build privilege escalation vulnerability is rated as **medium** , as it requires an attacker to be a valid user of Jenkins, with write access.

The last denial of service attack is rated **low** , as it also requires an attacker to be a valid user of Jenkins with write access, and this does not result in any data loss nor privilege escalation.

### Fix

* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.502
* LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.3
* Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.447.x should upgrade to 1.447.7.1
* Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.466.x should upgrade to 1.466.13.1
* Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.480.x should upgrade to 1.480.3.1
* Fix has already been deployed to DEV@cloud

All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.

As a part of the fix, these versions contain the following incompatible changes. Administrators of Jenkins need to be aware of the following implications of the upgrade:

* JSONP support in [Remote access API](http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote%2Baccess%2BAPI) is removed. If you have other programs that depend on this behavior, you can set the hudson.model.Api.INSECURE system property to true, to resurrect behaviour. However, this is highly discouraged.
* If your Jenkins does not have the security enabled, some of the [Remote access API](http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote%2Baccess%2BAPI) calls that previously didn't require POST now require it. See the "CSRF Protection" section of the remote access API page for how to add necessary header.
