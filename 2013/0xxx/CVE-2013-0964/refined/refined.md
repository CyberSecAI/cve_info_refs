Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-0964:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The kernel did not properly validate user-mode pointers and lengths passed to the `copyin` and `copyout` functions when the length was smaller than one page. This oversight allowed user-mode processes to potentially access kernel memory directly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient validation of arguments passed to `copyin` and `copyout` functions. Specifically, the checks for valid memory access were bypassed when the length of data being copied was less than one page.
- Direct kernel memory access from user-mode process

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A user-mode process could potentially read the first page of kernel memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user-mode process would need to make calls to `copyin` or `copyout` with a length smaller than one page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to execute code on the vulnerable device within a user-mode process context.

**Affected Products:**
- Apple TV 2nd generation and later (Apple TV 5.2)
- iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later (iOS 6.1)

**Fix:**
- The issue was addressed through additional validation of the arguments to `copyin` and `copyout`.
