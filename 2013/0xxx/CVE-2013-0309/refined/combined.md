## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 kernel update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0496)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, address several
hundred bugs, and add numerous enhancements are now available as part of
the ongoing support and maintenance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.
This is the fourth regular update.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A race condition was found in the way asynchronous I/O and fallocate()

interacted when using the ext4 file system. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to expose random data from an extent whose data blocks
have not yet been written, and thus contain data from a deleted file.
(CVE-2012-4508, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the vhost kernel module handled descriptors

that spanned multiple regions. A privileged guest user in a KVM guest could
use this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges
on the host. (CVE-2013-0311, Important)

* It was found that the default SCSI command filter does not accommodate

commands that overlap across device classes. A privileged guest user could
potentially use this flaw to write arbitrary data to a LUN that is
passed-through as read-only. (CVE-2012-4542, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the xen\_failsafe\_callback() function in the

Linux kernel handled the failed iret (interrupt return) instruction
notification from the Xen hypervisor. An unprivileged user in a 32-bit
para-virtualized guest could use this flaw to crash the guest.
(CVE-2013-0190, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way pmd\_present() interacted with PROT\_NONE

memory ranges when transparent hugepages were in use. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2013-0309, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way CIPSO (Common IP Security Option) IP options

were validated when set from user mode. A local user able to set CIPSO IP
options on the socket could use this flaw to crash the system.
(CVE-2013-0310, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Theodore Ts'o for reporting CVE-2012-4508, and
Andrew Cooper of Citrix for reporting CVE-2013-0190. Upstream acknowledges
Dmitry Monakhov as the original reporter of CVE-2012-4508. The
CVE-2012-4542 issue was discovered by Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat.

This update also fixes several hundred bugs and adds enhancements. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Release Notes for information on the most
significant of these changes, and the Technical Notes for further
information, both linked to in the References.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 users are advised to install these updated
packages, which correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Release Notes and
Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

mm: thp: fix pmd\_present for split\_huge\_page and PROT\_NONE with THP

```
In many places !pmd_present has been converted to pmd_none.  For pmds
that's equivalent and pmd_none is quicker so using pmd_none is better.

However (unless we delete pmd_present) we should provide an accurate
pmd_present too.  This will avoid the risk of code thinking the pmd is non
present because it's under __split_huge_page_map, see the pmd_mknotpresent
there and the comment above it.

If the page has been mprotected as PROT_NONE, it would also lead to a
pmd_present false negative in the same way as the race with
split_huge_page.

Because the PSE bit stays on at all times (both during split_huge_page and
when the _PAGE_PROTNONE bit get set), we could only check for the PSE bit,
but checking the PROTNONE bit too is still good to remember pmd_present
must always keep PROT_NONE into account.

This explains a not reproducible BUG_ON that was seldom reported on the
lists.

The same issue is in pmd_large, it would go wrong with both PROT_NONE and
if it races with split_huge_page.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=912898#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-02-19 23:53:15 UTC  ``` Most VM places are using pmd_none but a few are still using pmd_present. The meaning is about the same for the pmd. However pmd_present would return the wrong value on PROT_NONE ranges. When the code using pmd_present gets a false negative, the kernel will crash. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system.  Upstream fix: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commit;h=027ef6c8>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=912898#c1)  Petr Matousek    2013-02-20 00:49:02 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=912898#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 07:02:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0496 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0496.html>   ``` |  |

Convert properly UTF-8 to UTF-16
commit fd3ba42c76d3d4b776120c2b24c1791e7bb3deb1 upstream.
wchar\_t is currently 16bit so converting a utf8 encoded characters not
in plane 0 (>= 0x10000) to wchar\_t (that is calling char2uni) lead to a
-EINVAL return. This patch detect utf8 in cifs\_strtoUTF16 and add special
code calling utf8s\_to\_utf16s.

JFFS2: don't fail on bitflips in OOB
commit 74d83beaa229aac7d126ac1ed9414658ff1a89d2 upstream.
JFFS2 was designed without thought for OOB bitflips, it seems, but they
can occur and will be reported to JFFS2 via mtd\_read\_oob()[1]. We don't
want to fail on these transactions, since the data was corrected.
[1] Few drivers report bitflips for OOB-only transactions. With such
drivers, this patch should have no effect.

JFFS2: fix unmount regression
commit a445f784ae5558a3da680aa6b39ed53c95a551c1 upstream.
This patch fixes regression introduced by
"8bdc81c jffs2: get rid of jffs2\_sync\_super". We submit a delayed work in order
to make sure the write-buffer is synchronized at some point. But we do not
flush it when we unmount, which causes an oops when we unmount the file-system
and then the delayed work is executed.
This patch fixes the issue by adding a "cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync()" infocation
in the '->sync\_fs()' handler. This will make sure the delayed work is canceled
on sync, unmount and re-mount. And because VFS always callse 'sync\_fs()' before
unmounting or remounting, this fixes the issue.

mmc: sh-mmcif: avoid oops on spurious interrupts
commit 8464dd52d3198dd05cafb005371d76e5339eb842 upstream.
On some systems, e.g., kzm9g, MMCIF interfaces can produce spurious
interrupts without any active request. To prevent the Oops, that results
in such cases, don't dereference the mmc request pointer until we make
sure, that we are indeed processing such a request.

mmc: slot-gpio: Fix missing assignment to ctx->ro\_gpio
commit 15e8a8e42966162c207bb97ed55c803bc437eeae upstream.
mmc\_gpio\_request\_ro() doesn't store the requested gpio in ctx->ro\_gpio.
As a result, subsequent calls to mmc\_gpio\_get\_ro() will always fail
with -ENOSYS because the gpio number isn't available to that function.

mmc: omap\_hsmmc: Pass on the suspend failure to the PM core
commit c4c8eeb4df00aabb641553d6fbcd46f458e56cd9 upstream.
In some cases mmc\_suspend\_host() is not able to claim the
host and proceed with the suspend process. The core returns
-EBUSY to the host controller driver. Unfortunately, the
host controller driver does not pass on this information
to the PM core and hence the system suspend process continues.
ret = mmc\_suspend\_host(host->mmc);
if (ret) {
host->suspended = 0;
if (host->pdata->resume) {
ret = host->pdata->resume(dev, host->slot\_id);
The return status from mmc\_suspend\_host() is overwritten by return
status from host->pdata->resume. So the original return status is lost.
In these cases the MMC core gets to an unexpected state
during resume and multiple issues related to MMC crop up.
1. Host controller driver starts accessing the device registers
before the clocks are enabled which leads to a prefetch abort.
2. A file copy thread which was launched before suspend gets
stuck due to the host not being reclaimed during resume.
To avoid such problems pass on the -EBUSY status to the PM core
from the host controller driver. With this change, MMC core
suspend might still fail but it does not end up making the
system unusable. Suspend gets aborted and the user can try
suspending the system again.

mtd: omap2: fix module loading
commit 4d3d688da8e7016f15483e9319b41311e1db9515 upstream.
Unloading the omap2 nand driver missed to release the memory region which will
result in not being able to request it again if one want to load the driver
later on.
This patch fixes following error when loading omap2 module after unloading:

mtd: mtdpart: break it as soon as we parse out the partitions
commit c51803ddba10d80d9f246066802c6e359cf1d44c upstream.
We may cause a memory leak when the @types has more then one parser.
Take the `default\_mtd\_part\_types` for example. The default\_mtd\_part\_types has
two parsers now: `cmdlinepart` and `ofpart`.
Assume the following case:
The kernel command line sets the partitions like:
#gpmi-nand:20m(boot),20m(kernel),1g(rootfs),-(user)
But the devicetree file(such as arch/arm/boot/dts/imx28-evk.dts) also sets
the same partitions as the kernel command line does.
In the current code, the partitions parsed out by the `ofpart` will
overwrite the @pparts which has already set by the `cmdlinepart` parser,
and the the partitions parsed out by the `cmdlinepart` is missed.
A memory leak occurs.
So we should break the code as soon as we parse out the partitions,
In actually, this patch makes a priority order between the parsers.
If one parser has already parsed out the partitions successfully,
it's no need to use another parser anymore.

ALSA: hda - Fix hang caused by race during suspend.
commit d17344b3547669f5b6ee4fda993d03737a141bd6 upstream.
There was a race condition when the system suspends while hda\_power\_work
is running in the work queue. If system suspend (snd\_hda\_suspend)
happens after the work queue releases power\_lock but before it calls
hda\_call\_codec\_suspend, codec\_suspend runs with power\_on=0, causing the
codec to power up for register reads, and hanging when it calls
cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync from the running work queue.
The call chain from the work queue will look like this:
hda\_power\_work <<- power\_on = 1, unlock, then power\_on cleard by suspend
hda\_call\_codec\_suspend
hda\_set\_power\_state
snd\_hda\_codec\_read
codec\_exec\_verb
snd\_hda\_power\_up
snd\_hda\_power\_save
\_\_snd\_hda\_power\_up
cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync <<-- cancelling executing wq
Fix this by waiting for the work queue to finish before starting suspend
if suspend is not happening on the work queue.

mempolicy: fix a memory corruption by refcount imbalance in alloc\_pages\_vma()
commit 00442ad04a5eac08a98255697c510e708f6082e2 upstream.
Commit cc9a6c877661 ("cpuset: mm: reduce large amounts of memory barrier
related damage v3") introduced a potential memory corruption.
shmem\_alloc\_page() uses a pseudo vma and it has one significant unique
combination, vma->vm\_ops=NULL and vma->policy->flags & MPOL\_F\_SHARED.
get\_vma\_policy() does NOT increase a policy ref when vma->vm\_ops=NULL
and mpol\_cond\_put() DOES decrease a policy ref when a policy has
MPOL\_F\_SHARED. Therefore, when a cpuset update race occurs,
alloc\_pages\_vma() falls in 'goto retry\_cpuset' path, decrements the
reference count and frees the policy prematurely.

mempolicy: fix a race in shared\_policy\_replace()
commit b22d127a39ddd10d93deee3d96e643657ad53a49 upstream.
shared\_policy\_replace() use of sp\_alloc() is unsafe. 1) sp\_node cannot
be dereferenced if sp->lock is not held and 2) another thread can modify
sp\_node between spin\_unlock for allocating a new sp node and next
spin\_lock. The bug was introduced before 2.6.12-rc2.
Kosaki's original patch for this problem was to allocate an sp node and
policy within shared\_policy\_replace and initialise it when the lock is
reacquired. I was not keen on this approach because it partially
duplicates sp\_alloc(). As the paths were sp->lock is taken are not that
performance critical this patch converts sp->lock to sp->mutex so it can
sleep when calling sp\_alloc().

The problem is that the structure is being prematurely freed due to a
reference count imbalance. In the following case mbind(addr, len) should
replace the memory policies of both vma1 and vma2 and thus they will
become to share the same mempolicy and the new mempolicy will have the
MPOL\_F\_SHARED flag.
+-------------------+-------------------+
| vma1 | vma2(shmem) |
+-------------------+-------------------+
| |
addr addr+len
alloc\_pages\_vma() uses get\_vma\_policy() and mpol\_cond\_put() pair for
maintaining the mempolicy reference count. The current rule is that
get\_vma\_policy() only increments refcount for shmem VMA and
mpol\_conf\_put() only decrements refcount if the policy has
MPOL\_F\_SHARED.
In above case, vma1 is not shmem vma and vma->policy has MPOL\_F\_SHARED!
The reference count will be decreased even though was not increased
whenever alloc\_page\_vma() is called. This has been broken since commit
[52cd3b07: mempolicy: rework mempolicy Reference Counting] in 2008.
There is another serious bug with the sharing of memory policies.
Currently, mempolicy rebind logic (it is called from cpuset rebinding)
ignores a refcount of mempolicy and override it forcibly. Thus, any
mempolicy sharing may cause mempolicy corruption. The bug was
introduced by commit [68860ec1: cpusets: automatic numa mempolicy
rebinding].
Ideally, the shared policy handling would be rewritten to either
properly handle COW of the policy structures or at least reference count
MPOL\_F\_SHARED based exclusively on information within the policy.
However, this patch takes the easier approach of disabling any policy
sharing between VMAs. Each new range allocated with sp\_alloc will
allocate a new policy, set the reference count to 1 and drop the
reference count of the old policy. This increases the memory footprint
but is not expected to be a major problem as mbind() is unlikely to be
used for fine-grained ranges. It is also inefficient because it means
we allocate a new policy even in cases where mbind\_range() could use the
new\_policy passed to it. However, it is more straight-forward and the
change should be invisible to the user.

rcu: Fix day-one dyntick-idle stall-warning bug
commit a10d206ef1a83121ab7430cb196e0376a7145b22 upstream.
Each grace period is supposed to have at least one callback waiting
for that grace period to complete. However, if CONFIG\_NO\_HZ=n, an
extra callback-free grace period is no big problem -- it will chew up
a tiny bit of CPU time, but it will complete normally. In contrast,
CONFIG\_NO\_HZ=y kernels have the potential for all the CPUs to go to
sleep indefinitely, in turn indefinitely delaying completion of the
callback-free grace period. Given that nothing is waiting on this grace
period, this is also not a problem.
That is, unless RCU CPU stall warnings are also enabled, as they are
in recent kernels. In this case, if a CPU wakes up after at least one
minute of inactivity, an RCU CPU stall warning will result. The reason
that no one noticed until quite recently is that most systems have enough
OS noise that they will never remain absolutely idle for a full minute.
But there are some embedded systems with cut-down userspace configurations
that consistently get into this situation.
All this begs the question of exactly how a callback-free grace period
gets started in the first place. This can happen due to the fact that
CPUs do not necessarily agree on which grace period is in progress.
If a CPU still believes that the grace period that just completed is
still ongoing, it will believe that it has callbacks that need to wait for
another grace period, never mind the fact that the grace period that they
were waiting for just completed. This CPU can therefore erroneously
decide to start a new grace period. Note that this can happen in
TREE\_RCU and TREE\_PREEMPT\_RCU even on a single-CPU system: Deadlock
considerations mean that the CPU that detected the end of the grace
period is not necessarily officially informed of this fact for some time.
Once this CPU notices that the earlier grace period completed, it will
invoke its callbacks. It then won't have any callbacks left. If no
other CPU has any callbacks, we now have a callback-free grace period.
This commit therefore makes CPUs check more carefully before starting a
new grace period. This new check relies on an array of tail pointers
into each CPU's list of callbacks. If the CPU is up to date on which
grace periods have completed, it checks to see if any callbacks follow
the RCU\_DONE\_TAIL segment, otherwise it checks to see if any callbacks
follow the RCU\_WAIT\_TAIL segment. The reason that this works is that
the RCU\_WAIT\_TAIL segment will be promoted to the RCU\_DONE\_TAIL segment
as soon as the CPU is officially notified that the old grace period
has ended.
This change is to cpu\_needs\_another\_gp(), which is called in a number
of places. The only one that really matters is in rcu\_start\_gp(), where
the root rcu\_node structure's ->lock is held, which prevents any
other CPU from starting or completing a grace period, so that the
comparison that determines whether the CPU is missing the completion
of a grace period is stable.

score: Add missing RCU idle APIs on idle loop
commit 0ee23fda59740767324b4340247ca41a2f498ca6 upstream.
In the old times, the whole idle task was considered
as an RCU quiescent state. But as RCU became more and
more successful overtime, some RCU read side critical
section have been added even in the code of some
architectures idle tasks, for tracing for example.
So nowadays, rcu\_idle\_enter() and rcu\_idle\_exit() must
be called by the architecture to tell RCU about the part
in the idle loop that doesn't make use of rcu read side

m32r: Add missing RCU idle APIs on idle loop
commit 48ae077cfce72591b8fc80e1dcc87806f86fed7f upstream.
In the old times, the whole idle task was considered
as an RCU quiescent state. But as RCU became more and
more successful overtime, some RCU read side critical
section have been added even in the code of some
architectures idle tasks, for tracing for example.
So nowadays, rcu\_idle\_enter() and rcu\_idle\_exit() must
be called by the architecture to tell RCU about the part
in the idle loop that doesn't make use of rcu read side
critical sections, typically the part that puts the CPU
in low power mode.

ia64: Add missing RCU idle APIs on idle loop
commit 93482f4ef1093f5961a63359a34612183d6beea0 upstream.
Traditionally, the entire idle task served as an RCU quiescent state.
But when RCU read side critical sections started appearing within the
idle loop, this traditional strategy became untenable. The fix was to
create new RCU APIs named rcu\_idle\_enter() and rcu\_idle\_exit(), which
must be called by each architecture's idle loop so that RCU can tell
when it is safe to ignore a given idle CPU.
Unfortunately, this fix was never applied to ia64, a shortcoming remedied
by this commit.

... since finish\_page\_flip needs the vblank timestamp generated
in drm\_handle\_vblank. Somehow all the gmch platforms get it right,
but all the pch platform irq handlers get is wrong. Hooray for copy&

Currently this gets papered over by a gross hack in finish\_page\_flip.

Note that without this, the new timestamp sanity checks in flip\_test

drm/i915: Flush the pending flips on the CRTC before modification
commit 5bb61643f6a70d48de9cfe91ad0fee0d618b6816 upstream.
This was meant to be the purpose of the
intel\_crtc\_wait\_for\_pending\_flips() function which is called whilst
preparing the CRTC for a modeset or before disabling. However, as Ville
Syrjala pointed out, we set the pending flip notification on the old
framebuffer that is no longer attached to the CRTC by the time we come
to flush the pending operations. Instead, we can simply wait on the
pending unpin work to be finished on this CRTC, knowning that the
hardware has therefore finished modifying the registers, before proceeding
with our direct access.
Fixes i-g-t/flip\_test on non-pch platforms. pch platforms simply
schedule the flip immediately when the pipe is disabled, leading
to other funny issues.

ALSA: snd-usb: Add quirks for Playback Designs devices
commit 2b58fd5b3193fd3af3d15114d95706087d25a7fe upstream.
Playback Designs' USB devices have some hardware limitations on their
USB interface. In particular:
- They need a 20ms delay after each class compliant request as the
hardware ACKs the USB packets before the device is actually ready
for the next command. Sending data immediately will result in buffer
overflows in the hardware.
- The devices send bogus feedback data at the start of each stream
which confuse the feedback format auto-detection.
This patch introduces a new quirks hook that is called after each
control packet and which adds a delay for all devices that match
Playback Designs' USB VID for now.
In addition, it adds a counter to snd\_usb\_endpoint to drop received
packets on the floor. Another new quirks function that is called once
an endpoint is started initializes that counter for these devices on
their sync endpoint.

ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix detection of ALC271X codec
commit 9f720bb9409ea5923361fbd3fdbc505ca36cf012 upstream.
In commit af741c1 ("ALSA: hda/realtek - Call alc\_auto\_parse\_customize\_define()
always after fixup"), alc\_auto\_parse\_customize\_define was moved after
detection of ALC271X.
The problem is that detection of ALC271X relies on spec->cdefine.platform\_type,
and it's set on alc\_auto\_parse\_customize\_define.
Move the alc\_auto\_parse\_customize\_define and its required fixup setup
before the block doing the ALC271X and other codec setup.

ALSA: hda/via - don't report presence on HPs with no presence support
commit cf55e904516947597d75fd3844acc24891a95772 upstream.
If headphone jack can't detect plug presence, and we have the jack in
the jack table, snd\_hda\_jack\_detect will return the plug as always
present (as it'll be considered as a phantom jack). The problem is that
when this happens, line out pins will always be disabled, resulting in
no sound if there are no headphones connected.
This was reported as a no sound problem after suspend on
http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1052499, since the bug doesn't manifests
on first initialization before the phantom jack is added, but on resume
we reexecute the initialization code, and via\_hp\_automute starts
reporting HP always present with the jack now on the table.

ALSA: aloop - add locking to timer access
commit d4f1e48bd11e3df6a26811f7a1f06c4225d92f7d upstream.
When the loopback timer handler is running, calling del\_timer() (for STOP
trigger) will not wait for the handler to complete before deactivating the
timer. The timer gets rescheduled in the handler as usual. Then a subsequent
START trigger will try to start the timer using add\_timer() with a timer pending
leading to a kernel panic.
Serialize the calls to add\_timer() and del\_timer() using a spin lock to avoid
this.

drm/i915: make sure we write all the DIP data bytes
commit adf00b26d18e1b3570451296e03bcb20e4798cdd upstream.
... even if the actual infoframe is smaller than the maximum possible
size.
If we don't write all the 32 DIP data bytes the InfoFrame ECC may not
be correctly calculated in some cases (e.g., when changing the port),
and this will lead to black screens on HDMI monitors. The ECC value is
generated by the hardware.
I don't see how this should break anything since we're writing 0 and
that should be the correct value, so this patch should be safe.
Notice that on IVB and older we actually have 64 bytes available for
VIDEO\_DIP\_DATA, but only bytes 0-31 actually store infoframe data: the
others are either read-only ECC values or marked as "reserved". On HSW
we only have 32 bytes, and the ECC value is stored on its own separate
read-only register. See BSpec.
This patch fixes bug #46761, which is marked as a regression
introduced by commit 4e89ee174bb2da341bf90a84321c7008a3c9210d:
drm/i915: set the DIP port on ibx\_write\_infoframe
Before commit 4e89 we were just failing to send AVI infoframes when we
needed to change the port, which can lead to black screens in some
cases. After commit 4e89 we started sending infoframes, but with a
possibly wrong ECC value. After this patch I hope we start sending
correct infoframes.

MIPS: ath79: use correct fractional dividers for {CPU,DDR}\_PLL on AR934x
commit 65fc7f9957c52ad4fdf4ee5dfe3a75aa0a633d39 upstream.
The current dividers in the code are wrong and this
leads to broken CPU frequency calculation on boards
where the fractional part is used.
For example, if the SoC is running from a 40MHz
reference clock, refdiv=1, nint=14, outdiv=0 and
nfrac=31 the real frequency is 579.375MHz but the
current code calculates 569.687MHz instead.
Because the system time is indirectly related to
the CPU frequency the broken computation causes
drift in the system time.
The correct divider is 2^6 for the CPU PLL and 2^10
for the DDR PLL. Use the correct values to fix the
issue.

mm: thp: fix pmd\_present for split\_huge\_page and PROT\_NONE with THP
commit 027ef6c87853b0a9df53175063028edb4950d476 upstream.
In many places !pmd\_present has been converted to pmd\_none. For pmds
that's equivalent and pmd\_none is quicker so using pmd\_none is better.
However (unless we delete pmd\_present) we should provide an accurate
pmd\_present too. This will avoid the risk of code thinking the pmd is non
present because it's under \_\_split\_huge\_page\_map, see the pmd\_mknotpresent
there and the comment above it.
If the page has been mprotected as PROT\_NONE, it would also lead to a
pmd\_present false negative in the same way as the race with
split\_huge\_page.
Because the PSE bit stays on at all times (both during split\_huge\_page and
when the \_PAGE\_PROTNONE bit get set), we could only check for the PSE bit,
but checking the PROTNONE bit too is still good to remember pmd\_present
must always keep PROT\_NONE into account.
This explains a not reproducible BUG\_ON that was seldom reported on the
lists.
The same issue is in pmd\_large, it would go wrong with both PROT\_NONE and
if it races with split\_huge\_page.

mm: fix invalidate\_complete\_page2() lock ordering
commit ec4d9f626d5908b6052c2973f37992f1db52e967 upstream.
In fuzzing with trinity, lockdep protested "possible irq lock inversion
dependency detected" when isolate\_lru\_page() reenabled interrupts while
still holding the supposedly irq-safe tree\_lock:
invalidate\_inode\_pages2
invalidate\_complete\_page2
spin\_lock\_irq(&mapping->tree\_lock)
clear\_page\_mlock
isolate\_lru\_page
spin\_unlock\_irq(&zone->lru\_lock)
isolate\_lru\_page() is correct to enable interrupts unconditionally:
invalidate\_complete\_page2() is incorrect to call clear\_page\_mlock() while
holding tree\_lock, which is supposed to nest inside lru\_lock.
Both truncate\_complete\_page() and invalidate\_complete\_page() call
clear\_page\_mlock() before taking tree\_lock to remove page from radix\_tree.
I guess invalidate\_complete\_page2() preferred to test PageDirty (again)
under tree\_lock before committing to the munlock; but since the page has
already been unmapped, its state is already somewhat inconsistent, and no
worse if clear\_page\_mlock() moved up.

hugetlb: do not use vma\_hugecache\_offset() for vma\_prio\_tree\_foreach
commit 36e4f20af833d1ce196e6a4ade05dc26c44652d1 upstream.
Commit 0c176d52b0b2 ("mm: hugetlb: fix pgoff computation when unmapping
page from vma") fixed pgoff calculation but it has replaced it by
vma\_hugecache\_offset() which is not approapriate for offsets used for
vma\_prio\_tree\_foreach() because that one expects index in page units
rather than in huge\_page\_shift.
Johannes said:
: The resulting index may not be too big, but it can be too small: assume
: hpage size of 2M and the address to unmap to be 0x200000. This is regular
: page index 512 and hpage index 1. If you have a VMA that maps the file
: only starting at the second huge page, that VMAs vm\_pgoff will be 512 but
: you ask for offset 1 and miss it even though it does map the page of
: interest. hugetlb\_cow() will try to unmap, miss the vma, and retry the
: cow until the allocation succeeds or the skipped vma(s) go away.

kpageflags: fix wrong KPF\_THP on non-huge compound pages
commit 7a71932d5676b7410ab64d149bad8bde6b0d8632 upstream.
KPF\_THP can be set on non-huge compound pages (like slab pages or pages
allocated by drivers with \_\_GFP\_COMP) because PageTransCompound only
checks PG\_head and PG\_tail. Obviously this is a bug and breaks user space
applications which look for thp via /proc/kpageflags.
This patch rules out setting KPF\_THP wrongly by additionally checking
PageLRU on the head pages.

ext4: fix mtime update in nodelalloc mode
commit 041bbb6d369811e948ae01f3d00414264076be35 upstream.
Commits 5e8830dc85d0 and 41c4d25f78c0 introduced a regression into
v3.6-rc1 for ext4 in nodealloc mode, such that mtime updates would not
take place for files modified via mmap if the page was already in the
page cache. This would also affect ext3 file systems mounted using
the ext4 file system driver.
The problem was that ext4\_page\_mkwrite() had a shortcut which would
avoid calling \_\_block\_page\_mkwrite() under some circumstances, and the
above two commit transferred the responsibility of calling
file\_update\_time() to \_\_block\_page\_mkwrite --- which woudln't get
called in some circumstances.
Since \_\_block\_page\_mkwrite() only has three callers,
block\_page\_mkwrite(), ext4\_page\_mkwrite, and nilfs\_page\_mkwrite(), the
best way to solve this is to move the responsibility for calling
file\_update\_time() to its caller.
This problem was found via xfstests #215 with a file system mounted
with -o nodelalloc.

commit b71fc079b5d8f42b2a52743c8d2f1d35d655b1c5 upstream.
Code tracking when transaction needs to be committed on fdatasync(2) forgets
to handle a situation when only inode's i\_size is changed. Thus in such
situations fdatasync(2) doesn't force transaction with new i\_size to disk
and that can result in wrong i\_size after a crash.

ext4: fix potential deadlock in ext4\_nonda\_switch()
commit 00d4e7362ed01987183e9528295de3213031309c upstream.
In ext4\_nonda\_switch(), if the file system is getting full we used to
call writeback\_inodes\_sb\_if\_idle(). The problem is that we can be
holding i\_mutex already, and this causes a potential deadlock when
writeback\_inodes\_sb\_if\_idle() when it tries to take s\_umount. (See
lockdep output below).
As it turns out we don't need need to hold s\_umount; the fact that we
are in the middle of the write(2) system call will keep the superblock
pinned. Unfortunately writeback\_inodes\_sb() checks to make sure
s\_umount is taken, and the VFS uses a different mechanism for making
sure the file system doesn't get unmounted out from under us. The
simplest way of dealing with this is to just simply grab s\_umount
using a trylock, and skip kicking the writeback flusher thread in the
very unlikely case that we can't take a read lock on s\_umount without
blocking.
Also, we now check the cirteria for kicking the writeback thread
before we decide to whether to fall back to non-delayed writeback, so
if there are any outstanding delayed allocation writes, we try to get
them resolved as soon as possible.

PCI: Check P2P bridge for invalid secondary/subordinate range
commit 1965f66e7db08d1ebccd24a59043eba826cc1ce8 upstream.
For bridges with "secondary > subordinate", i.e., invalid bus number
apertures, we don't enumerate anything behind the bridge unless the
user specified "pci=assign-busses".
This patch makes us automatically try to reassign the downstream bus
numbers in this case (just for that bridge, not for all bridges as
"pci=assign-busses" does).
We don't discover all the devices on the Intel DP43BF motherboard
without this change (or "pci=assign-busses") because its BIOS configures
a bridge as:
pci 0000:00:1e.0: PCI bridge to [bus 20-08] (subtractive decode)

SCSI: zfcp: only access zfcp\_scsi\_dev for valid scsi\_device
commit d436de8ce25f53a8a880a931886821f632247943 upstream.
\_\_scsi\_remove\_device (e.g. due to dev\_loss\_tmo) calls
zfcp\_scsi\_slave\_destroy which in turn sends a close LUN FSF request to
the adapter. After 30 seconds without response,
zfcp\_erp\_timeout\_handler kicks the ERP thread failing the close LUN
ERP action. zfcp\_erp\_wait in zfcp\_erp\_lun\_shutdown\_wait and thus
zfcp\_scsi\_slave\_destroy returns and then scsi\_device is no longer
valid. Sometime later the response to the close LUN FSF request may
finally come in. However, commit
b62a8d9b45b971a67a0f8413338c230e3117dff5
"[SCSI] zfcp: Use SCSI device data zfcp\_scsi\_dev instead of zfcp\_unit"
introduced a number of attempts to unconditionally access struct
zfcp\_scsi\_dev through struct scsi\_device causing a use-after-free.
This leads to an Oops due to kernel page fault in one of:
zfcp\_fsf\_abort\_fcp\_command\_handler, zfcp\_fsf\_open\_lun\_handler,
zfcp\_fsf\_close\_lun\_handler, zfcp\_fsf\_req\_trace,
zfcp\_fsf\_fcp\_handler\_common.
Move dereferencing of zfcp private data zfcp\_scsi\_dev allocated in
scsi\_device via scsi\_transport\_reserve\_device after the check for
potentially aborted FSF request and thus no longer valid scsi\_device.
Only then assign sdev\_to\_zfcp(sdev) to the local auto variable struct
zfcp\_scsi\_dev \*zfcp\_sdev.

Upstream commit f3450c7b917201bb49d67032e9f60d5125675d6a
"[SCSI] zfcp: Replace local reference counting with common kref"
accidentally dropped a reference count check before tearing down
zfcp\_ports that are potentially in use by zfcp\_units.
Even remote ports in use can be removed causing
unreachable garbage objects zfcp\_ports with zfcp\_units.
Thus units won't come back even after a manual port\_rescan.
The kref of zfcp\_port->dev.kobj is already used by the driver core.
We cannot re-use it to track the number of zfcp\_units.

SCSI: zfcp: Do not wakeup while suspended
commit cb45214960bc989af8b911ebd77da541c797717d upstream.
If the mapping of FCP device bus ID and corresponding subchannel
is modified while the Linux image is suspended, the resume of FCP
devices can fail. During resume, zfcp gets callbacks from cio regarding
the modified subchannels but they can be arbitrarily mixed with the
restore/resume callback. Since the cio callbacks would trigger
adapter recovery, zfcp could wakeup before the resume callback.
Therefore, ignore the cio callbacks regarding subchannels while
being suspended. We can safely do so, since zfcp does not deal itself
with subchannels. For problem determination purposes, we still trace the
ignored callback events.
The following kernel messages could be seen on resume:
kernel: : parent  should not be sleeping
As part of adapter reopen recovery, zfcp performs auto port scanning
which can erroneously try to register new remote ports with
scsi\_transport\_fc and the device core code complains about the parent
(adapter) still sleeping.
kernel: zfcp.3dff9c: :\
Setting up the QDIO connection to the FCP adapter failed
kernel: zfcp.574d43: :\
ERP cannot recover an error on the FCP device
In such cases, the adapter gave up recovery and remained blocked along
with its child objects: remote ports and LUNs/scsi devices. Even the
adapter shutdown as part of giving up recovery failed because the ccw
device state remained disconnected. Later, the corresponding remote
ports ran into dev\_loss\_tmo. As a result, the LUNs were erroneously
not available again after resume.
Even a manually triggered adapter recovery (e.g. sysfs attribute
failed, or device offline/online via sysfs) could not recover the
adapter due to the remaining disconnected state of the corresponding
ccw device.

SCSI: zfcp: Bounds checking for deferred error trace
commit 01e60527f0a49b3d7df603010bd6079bb4b6cf07 upstream.
The pl vector has scount elements, i.e. pl[scount-1] is the last valid
element. For maximum sized requests, payload->counter == scount after
the last loop iteration. Therefore, do bounds checking first (with
boolean shortcut) to not access the invalid element pl[scount].
Do not trust the maximum sbale->scount value from the HBA
but ensure we won't access the pl vector out of our allocated bounds.
While at it, clean up scoping and prevent unnecessary memset.

ipv6: del unreachable route when an addr is deleted on lo

When an address is added on loopback (ip -6 a a 2002::1/128 dev lo), two routes

- one in the local table:
local 2002::1 via :: dev lo proto none metric 0
- one the in main table (for the prefix):
unreachable 2002::1 dev lo proto kernel metric 256 error -101
When the address is deleted, the route inserted in the main table remains
because we use rt6\_lookup(), which returns NULL when dst->error is set, which
is the case here! Thus, it is better to use ip6\_route\_lookup() to avoid this
kind of filter.

ipv4: add a fib\_type to fib\_info
[ Upstream commit f4ef85bbda96324785097356336bc79cdd37db0a ]
commit d2d68ba9fe8 (ipv4: Cache input routes in fib\_info nexthops.)
introduced a regression for forwarding.
This was hard to reproduce but the symptom was that packets were
delivered to local host instead of being forwarded.
David suggested to add fib\_type to fib\_info so that we dont
inadvertently share same fib\_info for different purposes.
With help from Julian Anastasov who provided very helpful
hints, reproduced here :
Can it be a problem related to fib\_info reuse
from different routes. For example, when local IP address
is created for subnet we have:
broadcast 192.168.0.255 dev DEV proto kernel scope link src
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.0/24 dev DEV proto kernel scope link src 192.168.0.1
local 192.168.0.1 dev DEV proto kernel scope host src 192.168.0.1
The "dev DEV proto kernel scope link src 192.168.0.1" is
a reused fib\_info structure where we put cached routes.
The result can be same fib\_info for 192.168.0.255 and
192.168.0.0/24. RTN\_BROADCAST is cached only for input
routes. Incoming broadcast to 192.168.0.255 can be cached
and can cause problems for traffic forwarded to 192.168.0.0/24.
So, this patch should solve the problem because it
separates the broadcast from unicast traffic.
And the ip\_route\_input\_slow caching will work for
local and broadcast input routes (above routes 1 and 3) just
because they differ in scope and use different fib\_info.

workqueue: fix possible stall on try\_to\_grab\_pending() of a delayed work item
commit 3aa62497594430ea522050b75c033f71f2c60ee6 upstream.
Currently, when try\_to\_grab\_pending() grabs a delayed work item, it
leaves its linked work items alone on the delayed\_works. The linked
work items are always NO\_COLOR and will cause future
cwq\_activate\_first\_delayed() increase cwq->nr\_active incorrectly, and
may cause the whole cwq to stall. For example,
state: cwq->max\_active = 1, cwq->nr\_active = 1
one work in cwq->pool, many in cwq->delayed\_works.
step1: try\_to\_grab\_pending() removes a work item from delayed\_works
but leaves its NO\_COLOR linked work items on it.
step2: Later on, cwq\_activate\_first\_delayed() activates the linked
work item increasing ->nr\_active.
step3: cwq->nr\_active = 1, but all activated work items of the cwq are
NO\_COLOR. When they finish, cwq->nr\_active will not be
decreased due to NO\_COLOR, and no further work items will be
activated from cwq->delayed\_works. the cwq stalls.
Fix it by ensuring the target work item is activated before stealing
PENDING in try\_to\_grab\_pending(). This ensures that all the linked
work items are activated without incorrectly bumping cwq->nr\_active.

workqueue: add missing smp\_wmb() in process\_one\_work()
commit 959d1af8cffc8fd38ed53e8be1cf4ab8782f9c00 upstream.
WORK\_STRUCT\_PENDING is used to claim ownership of a work item and
process\_one\_work() releases it before starting execution. When
someone else grabs PENDING, all pre-release updates to the work item
should be visible and all updates made by the new owner should happen
afterwards.
Grabbing PENDING uses test\_and\_set\_bit() and thus has a full barrier;
however, clearing doesn't have a matching wmb. Given the preceding
spin\_unlock and use of clear\_bit, I don't believe this can be a
problem on an actual machine and there hasn't been any related report
but it still is theretically possible for clear\_pending to permeate
upwards and happen before work->entry update.
Add an explicit smp\_wmb() before work\_clear\_pending().

in the ethtool get\_ts\_info function. The issue is resolved by removing
unsupported modes from the Rx supported list.

powerpc/eeh: Fix crash on converting OF node to edev
commit 1e38b7140185e384da216aff66a711df09b5afc9 upstream.
The kernel crash was reported by Alexy. He was testing some feature
with private kernel, in which Alexy added some code in pci\_pm\_reset()
to read the CSR after writting it. The bug could be reproduced on
Fiber Channel card (Fibre Channel: Emulex Corporation Saturn-X:
LightPulse Fibre Channel Host Adapter (rev 03)) by the following
commands.
# echo 1 > /sys/devices/pci0004:01/0004:01:00.0/reset
# rmmod lpfc
# modprobe lpfc
The history behind the test case is that those additional config
space reading operations in pci\_pm\_reset() would cause EEH error,
but we didn't detect EEH error until "modprobe lpfc". For the case,
all the PCI devices on PCI bus (0004:01) were removed and added after
PE reset. Then the EEH devices would be figured out again based on
the OF nodes. Unfortunately, there were some child OF nodes under
PCI device (0004:01:00.0), but they didn't have attached PCI\_DN since
they're invisible from PCI domain. However, we were still trying to
convert OF node to EEH device without checking on the attached PCI\_DN.
Eventually, it caused the kernel crash as follows:

powerpc: Fix VMX fix for memcpy case
commit c8adfeccee01ce3de6a7d14fcd4e3be02e27f03c upstream.
In 2fae7cdb60240e2e2d9b378afbf6d9fcce8a3890 ("powerpc: Fix VMX in
interrupt check in POWER7 copy loops"), Anton inadvertently
introduced a regression for memcpy on POWER7 machines. copyuser and
memcpy diverge slightly in their use of cr1 (copyuser doesn't use it,
but memcpy does) and you end up clobbering that register with your fix.
That results in (taken from an FC18 kernel):

drivers/scsi/atp870u.c: fix bad use of udelay
commit 0f6d93aa9d96cc9022b51bd10d462b03296be146 upstream.
The ACARD driver calls udelay() with a value > 2000, which leads to to
the following compilation error on ARM:
ERROR: "\_\_bad\_udelay" [drivers/scsi/atp870u.ko] undefined!
make[1]: \*\*\* [\_\_modpost] Error 1
This is because udelay is defined on ARM, roughly speaking, as
#define udelay(n) ((n) > 2000 ? \_\_bad\_udelay() : \
\_\_const\_udelay((n) \* ((2199023U\*HZ)>>11)))
The argument to \_\_const\_udelay is the number of jiffies to wait divided
by 4, but this does not work unless the multiplication does not
overflow, and that is what the build error is designed to prevent. The
intended behavior can be achieved by using mdelay to call udelay
multiple times in a loop.

kernel/sys.c: call disable\_nonboot\_cpus() in kernel\_restart()
commit f96972f2dc6365421cf2366ebd61ee4cf060c8d5 upstream.
As kernel\_power\_off() calls disable\_nonboot\_cpus(), we may also want to
have kernel\_restart() call disable\_nonboot\_cpus(). Doing so can help
machines that require boot cpu be the last alive cpu during reboot to
survive with kernel restart.
This fixes one reboot issue seen on imx6q (Cortex-A9 Quad). The machine
requires that the restart routine be run on the primary cpu rather than
secondary ones. Otherwise, the secondary core running the restart
routine will fail to come to online after reboot.

mfd: 88pm860x: Move \_IO resources out of ioport\_ioresource
commit c10c2aab634a3c61c46b98875988b2f53040bc9c upstream.
The removal of mach/io.h from most ARM platforms also set the range of
valid IO ports to be empty for most platforms when previously any 32
bit integer had been valid. This makes it impossible to add IO resources
as the added range is smaller than that of the root resource for IO ports.
Since we're not really using IO memory at all fix this by defining our
own root resource outside the normal tree and make that the parent of
all IO resources. This also ensures we won't conflict with read IO ports
if we ever run on a platform which happens to use them.

em28xx-dvb, em28xx-alsa and em28xx-ir are typically initialized
asyncrhronously. The exception for it is when those modules
are loaded before em28xx (or before an em28xx card insertion) or
when they're built in.
Make the extentions to always load asynchronously. That allows
having all DVB firmwares loaded synchronously with udev-182.

ARM: 7548/1: include linux/sched.h in syscall.h
commit 8ef102c6b4bc996ff96ca52b34775fe931ec90c9 upstream.
The syscall tracing patch introduces a compile bug in lttng-modules
when the latter calls syscall\_get\_nr(), similar to the following:
/arch/arm/include/asm/syscall.h:21:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'task\_thread\_info' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
The issue is that we are using task\_thread\_info() in the
syscall\_get\_nr() function in asm/syscall.h, but not explicitly
including sched.h from this file, so we can expect this bug might
surface any time that syscall\_get\_nr() is called.
Explicitly including sched.h solves the problem.

intel-iommu: Default to non-coherent for domains unattached to iommus
commit 2e12bc29fc5a12242d68e11875db3dd58efad9ff upstream.
domain\_update\_iommu\_coherency() currently defaults to setting domains
as coherent when the domain is not attached to any iommus. This
allows for a window in domain\_context\_mapping\_one() where such a
domain can update context entries non-coherently, and only after
update the domain capability to clear iommu\_coherency.
This can be seen using KVM device assignment on VT-d systems that
do not support coherency in the ecap register. When a device is
added to a guest, a domain is created (iommu\_coherency = 0), the
device is attached, and ranges are mapped. If we then hot unplug
the device, the coherency is updated and set to the default (1)
since no iommus are attached to the domain. A subsequent attach
of a device makes use of the same dmar domain (now marked coherent)
updates context entries with coherency enabled, and only disables
coherency as the last step in the process.
To fix this, switch domain\_update\_iommu\_coherency() to use the
safer, non-coherent default for domains not attached to iommus.

powerpc/iommu: Fix multiple issues with IOMMU pools code
commit d900bd7366463fd96a907b2c212242e2b68b27d8 upstream.
There are a number of issues in the recent IOMMU pools code:
- On a preempt kernel we might switch CPUs in the middle of building
a scatter gather list. When this happens the handle hint passed in
no longer falls within the local CPU's pool. Check for this and
fall back to the pool hint.
- We were missing a spin\_unlock/spin\_lock in one spot where we
switch pools.
- We need to provide locking around dart\_tlb\_invalidate\_all and
dart\_tlb\_invalidate\_one now that the global lock is gone.

slab: fix the DEADLOCK issue on l3 alien lock
commit 947ca1856a7e60aa6d20536785e6a42dff25aa6e upstream.
DEADLOCK will be report while running a kernel with NUMA and LOCKDEP enabled,
the process of this fake report is:
kmem\_cache\_free() //free obj in cachep
-> cache\_free\_alien() //acquire cachep's l3 alien lock
-> \_\_drain\_alien\_cache()
-> free\_block()
-> slab\_destroy()
-> kmem\_cache\_free() //free slab in cachep->slabp\_cache
-> cache\_free\_alien() //acquire cachep->slabp\_cache's l3 alien lock
Since the cachep and cachep->slabp\_cache's l3 alien are in the same lock class,
fake report generated.
This should not happen since we already have init\_lock\_keys() which will
reassign the lock class for both l3 list and l3 alien.
However, init\_lock\_keys() was invoked at a wrong position which is before we
invoke enable\_cpucache() on each cache.
Since until set slab\_state to be FULL, we won't invoke enable\_cpucache()
on caches to build their l3 alien while creating them, so although we invoked
init\_lock\_keys(), the l3 alien lock class won't change since we don't have
them until invoked enable\_cpucache() later.
This patch will invoke init\_lock\_keys() after we done enable\_cpucache()
instead of before to avoid the fake DEADLOCK report.
Michael traced the problem back to a commit in release 3.0.0:

kbuild: Fix gcc -x syntax
commit b1e0d8b70fa31821ebca3965f2ef8619d7c5e316 upstream.
The correct syntax for gcc -x is "gcc -x assembler", not
"gcc -xassembler". Even though the latter happens to work, the former
is what is documented in the manual page and thus what gcc wrappers
such as icecream do expect.
This isn't a cosmetic change. The missing space prevents icecream from
recognizing compilation tasks it can't handle, leading to silent kernel
miscompilations.
Besides me, credits go to Michael Matz and Dirk Mueller for
investigating the miscompilation issue and tracking it down to this
incorrect -x parameter syntax.

kbuild: make: fix if\_changed when command contains backslashes
commit c353acba28fb3fa1fd05fd6b85a9fc7938330f9c upstream.
The call if\_changed mechanism does not work when the command contains
backslashes. This basically is an issue with lzo and bzip2 compressed
kernels. The compressed binaries do not contain the uncompressed image
size, so these use size\_append to append the size. This results in
backslashes in the executed command. With this if\_changed always
detects a change in the command and rebuilds the compressed image even
if nothing has changed.
Fix this by escaping backslashes in make-cmd
