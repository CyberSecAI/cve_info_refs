## The TigerText Free Consumer Private Texting App (iOS) sends unencrypted user information in support requests

#### Vulnerability Note VU#704916

Original Release Date: 2013-04-02 | Last Revised: 2013-04-02

---

### Overview

The TigerText Free Consumer Private Texting App (iOS) sends unencrypted user information to TigerText support.

### Description

| The TigerText app generates an unencrypted log file containing the TigerText username and password on the device when a user taps on "Contact Customer Support." An email is generated to support that sends the log information with it. This does not impact the TigerText Pro application. |
| --- |

### Impact

| TigerText usernames and passwords may be viewable by TigerText support or others with access to the device or email. A recipient of the email containing the log file could use credentials to impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access to any non-expired messages. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  An updated app is available from the iTunes App Store. Version 3.1.402 or above contains a patch that removes sensitive information from the log file. The latest version is available here: <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiger-text/id355832697?mt=8> |
