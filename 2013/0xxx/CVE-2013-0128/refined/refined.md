- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The TigerText Free Consumer Private Texting App (iOS) generates an unencrypted log file containing the TigerText username and password on the device when a user taps on "Contact Customer Support." This log file, along with the credentials, is then sent via email to TigerText support.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unencrypted storage of sensitive user information (username and password) in a log file, and transmission of this sensitive information via email without encryption. This is related to CWE-260: Password Management: Hardcoded Credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential for impersonation, and access to non-expired messages.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Access to the device containing the log file.
    - Interception of the email containing the log file.
    - Direct access by TigerText support to the log file and credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Physical access to the iOS device.
    - Access to the email account that receives the support request (TigerText support or potentially a compromised intermediary).
    - Ability to intercept the unencrypted email containing the log information.
