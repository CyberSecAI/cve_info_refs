  "CVE-2013-0313": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2013-0313",
      "Description": "Linux kernel built with Extended Verification Module(EVM) and configured properly, is vulnerable to a NULL pointer de-reference flaw, caused by accessing extended attribute routines of sockfs inode object. An unprivileged user/program could use this to crash the kernel, resulting in DoS."
    },
    "Technical Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability occurs because socket file systems do not define the `removexattr` operation, and the EVM code does not check if the `removexattr` function pointer is NULL before calling it.",
      "Vulnerability": "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Impact": "A local unprivileged user can trigger a kernel crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).",
      "Attack Vector": "Local access is needed to execute a program that calls fchmod on a socket.",
       "Required Capabilities": "An unprivileged user needs to be able to create and manipulate socket file descriptors and execute the fchmod operation."
    },
    "Affected Code": {
        "File": "security/integrity/evm/evm_crypto.c",
        "Lines": "207-208"
    },
    "Fix": {
      "Description": "The fix checks if the removexattr function pointer of an inode is NULL before calling it.",
      "Commit": "https://git.kernel.org/linus/a67adb997419fb53540d4a4f79c6471c60bc69b6"
