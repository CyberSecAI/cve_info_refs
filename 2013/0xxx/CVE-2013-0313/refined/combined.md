This happens because sockets do not define the removexattr operation.
Before removing the xattr, verify the removexattr function pointer is
not NULL.

dma: tegra: implement flags parameters for cyclic transfer
commit b9bb37f5486ba05d2b557dbf1aeb754fef618985 upstream.
The flag parameter is added in the cyclic transfer request.
Use the flag option of:
- DMA\_PREP\_INTERRUPT for enabling interrupt.
- DMA\_CTRL\_ACK for deciding whether ack is requred or not for
descriptor.

ioat: Fix DMA memory sync direction correct flag
commit ac4989874af56435c308bdde9ad9c837a26f8b23 upstream.
ioat does DMA memory sync with DMA\_TO\_DEVICE direction on a buffer allocated
for DMA\_FROM\_DEVICE dma, resulting in the following warning from dma debug.
Fixed the dma\_sync\_single\_for\_device() call to use the correct direction.

commit 0f7569d07a5a70c07486e95ff436dc6afe8e3bb6
Author: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk

intel\_idle: Don't register CPU notifier if we are not running.
commit 6f8c2e7933679f54b6478945dc72e59ef9a3d5e0 upstream.
The 'intel\_idle\_probe' probes the CPU and sets the CPU notifier.
But if later on during the module initialization we fail (say
in cpuidle\_register\_driver), we stop loading, but we neglect
to unregister the CPU notifier. This means that during CPU
hotplug events the system will fail:
calling intel\_idle\_init+0x0/0x326 @ 1
intel\_idle: MWAIT substates: 0x1120
intel\_idle: v0.4 model 0x2A
intel\_idle: lapic\_timer\_reliable\_states 0xffffffff
intel\_idle: intel\_idle yielding to none
initcall intel\_idle\_init+0x0/0x326 returned -19 after 14 usecs
... some time later, offlining and onlining a CPU:

i2c: mxs: Fix type of error code
commit 0f40cbc4f85e13b1a42ae2f41231645a14965872 upstream.
cmd\_err is used to handle error code, so it should not be unsigned.
This fixes the following warning when building with W=1 option:

ACPI: Check MSR valid bit before using P-state frequencies
commit 9855d8ce41a7801548a05d844db2f46c3e810166 upstream.
To fix incorrect P-state frequencies which can happen on
some AMD systems f594065faf4f9067c2283a34619fc0714e79a98d
"ACPI: Add fixups for AMD P-state figures"
introduced a quirk to obtain the correct values by reading
from AMD specific MSRs.
This did cause a regression when running a kernel using that
quirk under Xen which does (currently) not pass through MSR
reads to the HW. Instead the guest gets a 0 in return.
And this seems to cause a failure to initialize the ondemand
governour (hard to say for sure as all P-states appear to run
at the same frequency).
While this should also be fixed in the hypervisor (to allow
a guest to read that MSR), this patch is intended to work
around the issue in the meantime. In discussion it turned out
that indeed real HW/BIOSes may choose to not set the valid bit
and thus mark the P-state as invalid. So this could be considered
a fix for broken BIOSes that also works around the issue on Xen.

ACPI / cpuidle: Fix NULL pointer issues when cpuidle is disabled

If cpuidle is disabled, that means that:

cpufreq: Add module aliases for acpi-cpufreq
commit efa17194581bdfca0986dabc178908bd7c21ba00 upstream.
The acpi core will call request\_module("acpi-cpufreq") on subsystem init,
but this will fail if the module isn't available at that stage of boot.
Add some module aliases to ensure that udev can load the module on Intel
and AMD systems with the appropriate feature bits - I /think/ that this
will also work on VIA systems, but haven't verified that.

Andreas reports in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=51741
that with his Gentoo config, acpi-cpufreq wasn't enabled and
powernow-k8 couldn't handoff properly to acpi-cpufreq leading to
running without P-state support (i.e., cores are constantly in P0).
To alleaviate that, we need to make powernow-k8 depend on acpi-cpufreq
so that acpi-cpufreq is always present.

Commit 1fb9341ac348 ("module: put modules in list much earlier") moved

changed the exit paths too. But for the duplicate export symbol error
case the change made the ddebug\_cleanup path jump to after the module

drivers/firmware/dmi\_scan.c: fetch dmi version from SMBIOS if it exists
commit 9f9c9cbb60576a1518d0bf93fb8e499cffccf377 upstream.
The right dmi version is in SMBIOS if it's zero in DMI region
This issue was originally found from an oracle bug.
One customer noticed system UUID doesn't match between dmidecode & uek2.
- HP ProLiant BL460c G6 :
# cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product\_uuid
00000000-0000-4C48-3031-4D5030333531
# dmidecode | grep -i uuid
UUID: 00000000-0000-484C-3031-4D5030333531
From SMBIOS 2.6 on, spec use little-endian encoding for UUID other than
network byte order.
So we need to get dmi version to distinguish. If version is 0.0, the
real version is taken from the SMBIOS version. This is part of original
kernel comment in code.

This patch fixes the following:
WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x1e709c): Section mismatch in reference from the funct
ion dma\_controller\_create() to the function .init.text:cppi\_controller\_start()
The function dma\_controller\_create() references
the function \_\_init cppi\_controller\_start().
This is often because dma\_controller\_create lacks a \_\_init
annotation or the annotation of cppi\_controller\_start is wrong.
This warning is there due to the deficiency in the commit 07a67bbb (usb: musb:
Make dma\_controller\_create \_\_devinit).
Since the start() method is only called from musb\_init\_controller() which is
not annotated, drop '\_\_init' annotation from cppi\_controller\_start() and also
cppi\_pool\_init() since it gets called from that function, to avoid another
section mismatch warning...

PCI: shpchp: Use per-slot workqueues to avoid deadlock
commit f652e7d2916fe2fcf9e7d709aa5b7476b431e2dd upstream.
When we have an SHPC-capable bridge with a second SHPC-capable bridge
below it, pushing the upstream bridge's attention button causes a
deadlock.
The deadlock happens because we use the shpchp\_wq workqueue to run
shpchp\_pushbutton\_thread(), which uses shpchp\_disable\_slot() to remove
devices below the upstream bridge. When we remove the downstream bridge,
we call shpc\_remove(), the shpchp driver's .remove() method. That calls
flush\_workqueue(shpchp\_wq), which deadlocks because the
shpchp\_pushbutton\_thread() work item is still running.
This patch avoids the deadlock by creating a workqueue for every slot
and removing the single shared workqueue.
Here's the call path that leads to the deadlock:
shpchp\_queue\_pushbutton\_work
queue\_work(shpchp\_wq) # shpchp\_pushbutton\_thread
...
shpchp\_pushbutton\_thread
shpchp\_disable\_slot
remove\_board
shpchp\_unconfigure\_device
pci\_stop\_and\_remove\_bus\_device
...
shpc\_remove # shpchp driver .remove method
hpc\_release\_ctlr
cleanup\_slots
flush\_workqueue(shpchp\_wq)
This change is based on code inspection, since we don't have hardware
with this topology.

pciehp\_power\_thread(), which uses pciehp\_disable\_slot() to remove devices
below the upstream port. When we remove the downstream PCIe port, we call
pciehp\_remove(), the pciehp driver's .remove() method. That calls
flush\_workqueue(pciehp\_wq), which deadlocks because the
pciehp\_power\_thread() work item is still running.
This patch avoids the deadlock by creating a workqueue for every PCIe port
and removing the single shared workqueue.
Here's the call path that leads to the deadlock:
pciehp\_queue\_pushbutton\_work
queue\_work(pciehp\_wq) # queue pciehp\_power\_thread
...
pciehp\_power\_thread
pciehp\_disable\_slot
remove\_board
pciehp\_unconfigure\_device
pci\_stop\_and\_remove\_bus\_device
...
pciehp\_remove # pciehp driver .remove method
pciehp\_release\_ctrl
pcie\_cleanup\_slot
flush\_workqueue(pciehp\_wq)
This is fairly urgent because it can be caused by simply unplugging a
Thunderbolt adapter, as reported by Daniel below.

PCI: Allow pcie\_aspm=force even when FADT indicates it is unsupported
commit 9e16721498b0c3d3ebfa0b503c63d35c0a4c0642 upstream.
Right now using pcie\_aspm=force will not enable ASPM if the FADT indicates
ASPM is unsupported. However, the semantics of force should probably allow
for this, especially as they did before 3c076351c4 ("PCI: Rework ASPM
disable code")
This patch just skips the clearing of any ASPM setup that the firmware has
carried out on this bus if pcie\_aspm=force is being used.

arm64: elf: fix core dumping to match what glibc expects
commit 9cf2b72b25f3f6a5a1a46a4f36037e66de52465c upstream.
The kernel's internal definition of ELF\_NGREG uses struct pt\_regs, which
means that we disagree with userspace on the size of coredumps since
glibc correctly uses the user-visible struct user\_pt\_regs.
This patch fixes our ELF\_NGREG definition to use struct user\_pt\_regs
and introduces our own ELF\_CORE\_COPY\_REGS to convert between the user
and kernel structure definitions.

ptrace: ensure arch\_ptrace/ptrace\_request can never race with SIGKILL
commit 9899d11f654474d2d54ea52ceaa2a1f4db3abd68 upstream.
putreg() assumes that the tracee is not running and pt\_regs\_access() can
safely play with its stack. However a killed tracee can return from
ptrace\_stop() to the low-level asm code and do RESTORE\_REST, this means
that debugger can actually read/modify the kernel stack until the tracee
does SAVE\_REST again.
set\_task\_blockstep() can race with SIGKILL too and in some sense this
race is even worse, the very fact the tracee can be woken up breaks the
logic.
As Linus suggested we can clear TASK\_WAKEKILL around the arch\_ptrace()
call, this ensures that nobody can ever wakeup the tracee while the
debugger looks at it. Not only this fixes the mentioned problems, we
can do some cleanups/simplifications in arch\_ptrace() paths.
Probably ptrace\_unfreeze\_traced() needs more callers, for example it
makes sense to make the tracee killable for oom-killer before
access\_process\_vm().
While at it, add the comment into may\_ptrace\_stop() to explain why
ptrace\_stop() still can't rely on SIGKILL and signal\_pending\_state().

ptrace: introduce signal\_wake\_up\_state() and ptrace\_signal\_wake\_up()
commit 910ffdb18a6408e14febbb6e4b6840fd2c928c82 upstream.
Cleanup and preparation for the next change.
signal\_wake\_up(resume => true) is overused. None of ptrace/jctl callers
actually want to wakeup a TASK\_WAKEKILL task, but they can't specify the
necessary mask.
Turn signal\_wake\_up() into signal\_wake\_up\_state(state), reintroduce
signal\_wake\_up() as a trivial helper, and add ptrace\_signal\_wake\_up()
which adds \_\_TASK\_TRACED.
This way ptrace\_signal\_wake\_up() can work "inside" ptrace\_request()
even if the tracee doesn't have the TASK\_WAKEKILL bit set.

perf x86: revert 20b279 - require exclude\_guest to use PEBS - kernel side
commit a706d965dcfdff73bf2bad1c300f8119900714c7 upstream.
This patch is brought to you by the letter 'H'.
Commit 20b279 breaks compatiblity with older perf binaries when run with
precise modifier (:p or :pp) by requiring the exclude\_guest attribute to be
set. Older binaries default exclude\_guest to 0 (ie., wanting guest-based
samples) unless host only profiling is requested (:H modifier). The workaround
for older binaries is to add H to the modifier list (e.g., -e cycles:ppH -
toggles exclude\_guest to 1). This was deemed unacceptable by Linus:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/12/570
Between family in town and the fresh snow in Breckenridge there is no time left
to be working on the proper fix for this over the holidays. In the New Year I
have more pressing problems to resolve -- like some memory leaks in perf which
are proving to be elusive -- although the aforementioned snow is probably why
they are proving to be elusive. Either way I do not have any spare time to work
on this and from the time I have managed to spend on it the solution is more
difficult than just moving to a new exclude\_guest flag (does not work) or
flipping the logic to include\_guest (which is not as trivial as one would
think).
So, two options: silently force exclude\_guest on as suggested by Gleb which
means no impact to older perf binaries or revert the original patch which
caused the breakage.
This patch does the latter -- reverts the original patch that introduced the
regression. The problem can be revisited in the future as time allows.

async: fix \_\_lowest\_in\_progress()
commit f56c3196f251012de9b3ebaff55732a9074fdaae upstream.
Commit 083b804c4d3e ("async: use workqueue for worker pool") made it
possible that async jobs are moved from pending to running out-of-order.
While pending async jobs will be queued and dispatched for execution in
the same order, nothing guarantees they'll enter "1) move self to the
running queue" of async\_run\_entry\_fn() in the same order.
Before the conversion, async implemented its own worker pool. An async
worker, upon being woken up, fetches the first item from the pending
list, which kept the executing lists sorted. The conversion to
workqueue was done by adding work\_struct to each async\_entry and async
just schedules the work item. The queueing and dispatching of such work
items are still in order but now each worker thread is associated with a
specific async\_entry and moves that specific async\_entry to the
executing list. So, depending on which worker reaches that point
earlier, which is non-deterministic, we may end up moving an async\_entry
with larger cookie before one with smaller one.
This broke \_\_lowest\_in\_progress(). running->domain may not be properly
sorted and is not guaranteed to contain lower cookies than pending list
when not empty. Fix it by ensuring sort-inserting to the running list
and always looking at both pending and running when trying to determine
the lowest cookie.
Over time, the async synchronization implementation became quite messy.
We better restructure it such that each async\_entry is linked to two
lists - one global and one per domain - and not move it when execution
starts. There's no reason to distinguish pending and running. They
behave the same for synchronization purposes.

virtio-blk: Don't free ida when disk is in use
commit f4953fe6c4aeada2d5cafd78aa97587a46d2d8f9 upstream.
When a file system is mounted on a virtio-blk disk, we then remove it
and then reattach it, the reattached disk gets the same disk name and
ids as the hot removed one.
This leads to very nasty effects - mostly rendering the newly attached
device completely unusable.
Trying what happens when I do the same thing with a USB device, I saw
that the sd node simply doesn't get free'd when a device gets forcefully
removed.
Imitate the same behavior for vd devices. This way broken vd devices
simply are never free'd and newly attached ones keep working just fine.

ftrace: Be first to run code modification on modules
commit c1bf08ac26e92122faab9f6c32ea8aba94612dae upstream.
If some other kernel subsystem has a module notifier, and adds a kprobe
to a ftrace mcount point (now that kprobes work on ftrace points),
when the ftrace notifier runs it will fail and disable ftrace, as well
as kprobes that are attached to ftrace points.
Here's the error:

A kprobe was added to the init\_once() function in the fat module on load.
But this happened before ftrace could have touched the code. As ftrace
didn't run yet, the kprobe system had no idea it was a ftrace point and
simply added a breakpoint to the code (0xcc in the cc:bb:d2:4b:e1).
Then when ftrace went to modify the location from a call to mcount/fentry
into a nop, it didn't see a call op, but instead it saw the breakpoint op
and not knowing what to do with it, ftrace shut itself down.
The solution is to simply give the ftrace module notifier the max priority.
This should have been done regardless, as the core code ftrace modification
also happens very early on in boot up. This makes the module modification
closer to core modification.

IDENTIFY word 78 bit 5(Hardware Feature Control) can't work either
because it is only the sufficient condition of Identify Device data
log, not the necessary condition.

drm/i915: Invalidate the relocation presumed\_offsets along the slow path
commit 262b6d363fcff16359c93bd58c297f961f6e6273 upstream.
In the slow path, we are forced to copy the relocations prior to
acquiring the struct mutex in order to handle pagefaults. We forgo
copying the new offsets back into the relocation entries in order to
prevent a recursive locking bug should we trigger a pagefault whilst
holding the mutex for the reservations of the execbuffer. Therefore, we
need to reset the presumed\_offsets just in case the objects are rebound
back into their old locations after relocating for this exexbuffer - if
that were to happen we would assume the relocations were valid and leave
the actual pointers to the kernels dangling, instant hang.

commit 8d6f01346caa705631292c41efb5924e1e677dd4

Ensure that kernel\_init\_freeable() is not inlined into non \_\_init code
commit f80b0c904da93b9ad7db2fd9823dd701932df779 upstream.
Commit d6b2123802d "make sure that we always have a return path from
kernel\_execve()" reshuffled kernel\_init()/init\_post() to ensure that
kernel\_execve() has a caller to return to.
It removed \_\_init annotation for kernel\_init() and introduced/calls a
new routine kernel\_init\_freeable(). Latter however is inlined by any
reasonable compiler (ARC gcc 4.4 in this case), causing slight code
bloat.
This patch forces kernel\_init\_freeable() as noinline reducing the .text

This happens because sockets do not define the removexattr operation.
Before removing the xattr, verify the removexattr function pointer is
not NULL.
