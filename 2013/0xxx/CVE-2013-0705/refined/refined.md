Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw present in the 3DM (3ware Disk Manager) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input related to file paths, allowing an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain arbitrary files from the server where 3DM is running. This could include sensitive system files, configuration files, or any other data accessible to the 3DM process.
**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network by sending specially crafted packets to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server running the vulnerable 3DM software.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, indicating that the vulnerable endpoint is publicly accessible and does not require user login.
- **Low Exploit Complexity:** The attack requires little to no expertise, indicating that it is easy to exploit.
