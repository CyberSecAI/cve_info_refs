The provided content is related to CVE-2013-0239.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Apache CXF `UsernameTokenPolicyValidator` and `UsernameTokenInterceptor` components allow a `UsernameToken` element with no password child element to bypass authentication. This occurs because the components were designed to support deriving keys from a `UsernameToken`, where a password element might not be present.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass: The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication checks when a `UsernameToken` element is sent without a password.
- Insecure default behavior: The components default to allowing authentication with an empty password when WS-SecurityPolicy is enabled for plaintext `UsernameTokens`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Circumvention of access controls: A remote attacker can bypass security restrictions on web services that rely on WS-SecurityPolicy plaintext `UsernameTokens` for authentication.
- Unauthorized access: By omitting the password in a `UsernameToken`, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to web services.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network attack: A remote attacker can send a specially crafted SOAP request with a `UsernameToken` lacking a password child element.
- Web services using WS-SecurityPolicy plaintext `UsernameTokens` are vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send SOAP requests to the vulnerable web service.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the web service's use of WS-SecurityPolicy plaintext `UsernameTokens` for authentication.
- No specific privileges or authentication is needed before the attack (due to the nature of the bypass).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is not applicable under the following conditions:
    - A custom `UsernameTokenValidator` is used that requires a password.
    - `sp:HashPassword` policy is used, requiring a hashed password in the token.
    - WS-Security is configured without WS-SecurityPolicy.
- The fix involves requiring a password element in the case of a (non-endorsing) `SupportingToken`.
- Patches were released in CXF versions 2.5.9, 2.6.6, and 2.7.3.
- Red Hat addressed this issue in RHSA-2013:0644, RHSA-2013:0645, RHSA-2013:0649 and RHSA-2013:0749.
