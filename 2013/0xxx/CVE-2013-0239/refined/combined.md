# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=905722#c0)  David Jorm    2013-01-30 02:37:22 UTC  ``` It was found that the Apache CXF UsernameTokenPolicyValidator and UsernameTokenInterceptor allow a UsernameToken element with no password child element to bypass authentication. A remote attacker could use this flaw to circumvent access controls applied to web services by omitting the password in a UsernameToken. If an incorrect password is provided, authentication will fail, but if the password is omitted, it will succeed. This flaw is exploitable on web services that rely on WS-SecurityPolicy plaintext UsernameTokens to authenticate users. It is not exploitable when using hashed passwords or WS-Security without WS-SecurityPolicy.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=905722#c1)  David Jorm    2013-01-30 02:49:54 UTC  ``` Upstream bug for Apache CXF:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-4776>  Upstream trunk patch commit:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1438424>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=905722#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-08 13:59:22 UTC  ```  Upstream advisory: <http://cxf.apache.org/cve-2013-0239.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=905722#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-08 14:06:44 UTC  ``` Created cxf tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 909247](show_bug.cgi?id=909247 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-5633 CVE-2013-0239 cxf various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=905722#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-13 18:49:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1  Via RHSA-2013:0645 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0645.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=905722#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-13 18:50:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 6 for RHEL 5   JBEAP 6 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0644 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0644.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=905722#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-14 16:49:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 Patch 3  Via RHSA-2013:0649 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0649.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=905722#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-04-16 18:54:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Portal Platform 6.0.0  Via RHSA-2013:0749 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0749.html>   ``` |  |

## Targeted Sponsors[¶](#targeted-sponsors "Permalink")

ASF Targeted Sponsors provide the Foundation with contributions for specific activities or programs, such as donating cloud services, funding a project hackathon, providing legal services, offering a community member benefit, underwriting expenses for our flagship event, or something entirely new. It's the Apache way of recognizing the sponsors that we rely on every day outside of and often in addition to funding our general operations.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
Hi all,

Two new critical security advisories against Apache CXF are announced:

<http://cxf.apache.org/cve-2012-5633.html>
<http://cxf.apache.org/cve-2013-0239.html>

Upgrading to CXF 2.7.3, 2.6.6 or 2.5.9 is strongly recommended.

Colm.

Severity: Critical  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected:  This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 2.5.9, 2.6.6 and 2.7.3.  Description:  The following WS-SecurityPolicy 1.3 fragment requires that a WS-Security UsernameToken must be present in the security header of a SOAP request:  <sp:UsernameToken sp:IncludeToken="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/200702/IncludeToken/AlwaysToRecipient"> <wsp:Policy> <sp:WssUsernameToken10/> </wsp:Policy> </sp:UsernameToken>  If a UsernameToken element is sent with no password child element, then a policy similar to the policy defined above will completely bypass authentication by default. This is due to the use-case of supporting deriving keys from a UsernameToken, where a password element would not be sent in the token.  The vulnerability does not apply in any of the following circumstances:  a) You are using a custom UsernameTokenValidator which does not allow the 'verifyUnknownPassword' use-case, or that otherwise insists that a password must be present in the token (such as the 'JAASUsernameTokenValidator' in WSS4J). b) You are using a 'sp:HashPassword' policy that requires a hashed password to be present in the token. c) You are using the older style of configuring WS-Security without using WS-SecurityPolicy.  If you are relying on WS-SecurityPolicy enabled plaintext UsernameTokens to authenticate users, and if neither points a) nor b) apply, then you must upgrade to a fixed version of CXF (see below), or else configure a custom UsernameTokenValidator implementation to insist that a password element must be present.  The fix has been to require a password element in the case of a (non-endorsing) SupportingToken.  This has been fixed in revisions:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1438424>  Migration:  Users of CXF prior to 2.5.x should upgrade to either 2.5.9, 2.6.6, or 2.7.3. CXF 2.5.x users should upgrade to 2.5.9 as soon as possible. CXF 2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.6 as soon as possible. CXF 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.3 as soon as possible.

# ASF Security Team[¶](#asf-security-team "Permalink")

The Apache Security Team guides Apache projects on security issues
and coordinates the handling of all security vulnerabilities. The team
is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) covering all Apache projects and is
the only group able to allocate IDs to Apache Software Foundation project
issues. Advisories are published per project, and may be reviewed via
the [project advisories](https://security.apache.org/projects/).

## Reporting a vulnerability[¶](#reporting-a-vulnerability "Permalink")

We strongly encourage you to report potential security vulnerabilities to one of
our private security mailing lists first, before disclosing them in a
public forum.

A [list of security contacts for Apache projects](https://security.apache.org/projects/) is
available. If you can't find a project-specific security e-mail address and
you have an undisclosed security vulnerability to report, use
the general security address below.

**Only use the security contacts to report undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Apache projects and
manage the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept
regular bug reports or other security-related queries at these addresses.
We will ignore mail sent to these addresses that does not relate to an undisclosed
security problem in an Apache project.**

**Also note that the security team handles vulnerabilities in Apache projects,
not running ASF services. Send reports of vulnerabilities in ASF
services to root@apache.org. (This includes issues with apache.org websites)**

The general security mailing list address is:
security@apache.org. This is a private
mailing list.

Please send one plain-text, unencrypted, email for each vulnerability you are reporting. We may
ask you to resubmit your report if you send it as an image, movie, HTML, or
PDF attachment when you could as easily describe it with plain text.

## Issues not considered as security vulnerabilities[¶](#non-issues "Permalink")

These are things that we are well aware of, and have been reported to us many
times, but we do not class as a security vulnerability.
Please do not report them.

Issues not classed as security relevant:

* A lack of DMARC or SPF record on our domains
* "Clickjacking" on our domains
* Directory listings. These are deliberate and do not contain sensitive information
* Systems that disclose the versions of the servers and software we use
* Data that is publically accessible in our Jira bug tracking system

## Vulnerability Information[¶](#vulnerability-information "Permalink")

You can usually find information on known vulnerabilities for an Apache project on the project's web pages. For convenience, consult the [list of
security information pages for Apache projects](projects.html). If you can't find the information you are looking for on the
project's web site, ask your question on the project's `users` mailing list. Do **not** ask the security contacts directly about:

* how to configure the package securely
* whether a published vulnerability applies to specific versions of the Apache
  packages you are using
* whether a published vulnerability applies to the configuration of the Apache
  packages you are using
* obtaining further information on a published vulnerability
* the availability of patches and/or new releases to address a published
  vulnerability

The relevant project's `users` list is the place to ask such questions. The Apache Security Team and any project security
team will ignore any such questions you send directly to them.

## Vulnerability handling[¶](#vulnerability-handling "Permalink")

An overview of the vulnerability handling process is:

* The reporter reports the vulnerability privately to Apache.
* The appropriate project's security team works privately with the reporter
  to resolve the vulnerability.
* The project creates a new release of the package the vulnerability affects to deliver its fix.
* The project publicly announces the vulnerability and describes how to apply the fix.

Committers should read a [more detailed description of the process](committers.html). Reporters of security vulnerabilities may also find
it useful.

## Discussion[¶](#discussion "Permalink")

Committers and Security Researchers are encouraged to join our [community discuss list](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?security-discuss@community.apache.org).

RHSA-2013:0749 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2013-04-16
Updated:
2013-04-16
# RHSA-2013:0749 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: apache-cxf security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for the Apache CXF component of JBoss Portal Platform 6.0.0 which
fixes two security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer
Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Apache CXF is an open source services framework.

It was found that the Apache CXF UsernameTokenPolicyValidator and
UsernameTokenInterceptor allowed a UsernameToken element with no password
child element to bypass authentication. A remote attacker could use this
flaw to circumvent access controls applied to web services by omitting the
password in a UsernameToken. This flaw was exploitable on web services that
rely on WS-SecurityPolicy plain text UsernameTokens to authenticate users.
It was not exploitable when using hashed passwords or WS-Security without
WS-SecurityPolicy. (CVE-2013-0239)

If web services were deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor
enabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these
services were always granted access, without applying authentication
checks. The URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing
REST-like access (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple
SOAP service using GET requests that bypass the security constraints
applied by WSS4JInInterceptor. This flaw was only exploitable if
WSS4JInInterceptor was used to apply WS-Security processing. Services that
use WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security were not affected. (CVE-2012-5633)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
JBoss Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration files, and
any databases and database settings.

All users of JBoss Portal Platform 6.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up all
applications deployed on JBoss Portal Platform, along with all customized
configuration files, and any databases and database settings.

Note that it is recommended to halt the JBoss Portal Platform server by
stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this
update, and then after installing the update, restart the JBoss Portal
Platform server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.
