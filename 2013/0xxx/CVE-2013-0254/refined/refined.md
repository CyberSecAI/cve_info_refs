  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2013-0254",
    "description": "A security flaw was found in the way QSharedMemory class implementation of the Qt toolkit created shared memory segments (they were created with world-readable and world-writeable permissions). A local attacker could use this flaw to read or alter content of particular shared memory segment, possibly leading to their ability to obtain sensitive information or influence behaviour of shared memory segment reader process.",
    "root_cause": "The QSharedMemory class in the Qt toolkit created shared memory segments with world-readable and world-writeable permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure permissions on shared memory segments"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could read or alter the content of shared memory segments, potentially leading to information disclosure or influencing the behavior of processes using shared memory.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access",
     "required_capabilities": "Local access to the system."
