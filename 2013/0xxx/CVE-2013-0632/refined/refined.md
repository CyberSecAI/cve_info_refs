Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-0632:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how Adobe ColdFusion handles authentication. Specifically, the Remote Development Services (RDS) component can be configured with an empty password (either by default or through misconfiguration). This allows an attacker to establish a session through RDS login, which can then be leveraged to bypass authentication on the ColdFusion administrator web interface, even if the admin password is set and different from RDS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the administrative authentication mechanism. This is due to a design flaw and insecure default configuration.
*   **Insecure RDS configuration:**  The RDS component, when configured with an empty password, acts as a backdoor.
*   **Session reuse:** A session established via RDS can be reused to gain access to the admin interface, circumventing the admin's password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain administrative access to the ColdFusion server. With admin access, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Data Breach/Loss:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data managed by the application.
*   **Availability Disruption:** Malicious actions, such as deleting files or causing a denial of service, can disrupt the availability of the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network, without prior access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs network access to the ColdFusion server to send requests to the RDS component and the admin interface.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of this bypass flaw and how to exploit it.
*   **No prior authentication:** The attacker can exploit this without any valid admin credentials.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
* The exploit-db content provides a Metasploit module that automates the exploitation of this vulnerability. The exploit module works on both Windows and Linux.
*  Adobe recommends using a security hotfix to address this vulnerability.
*  Adobe indicates that the vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.
*  It is possible to mitigate the vulnerability by setting a password for Remote Development Services (RDS) which is different from administrator credentials, enabling password protection for RDS, setting an admin password, and enabling password protection for the administrator interface. It also recommends restricting access to the `/CFIDE/administrator`, `/CFIDE/adminapi`, and `/CFIDE/componentutils` directories.
