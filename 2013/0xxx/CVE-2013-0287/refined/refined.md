Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-0287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Simple Access Provider in SSSD, when configured as an Active Directory client using the new Active Directory provider or equivalent configuration of the LDAP provider, doesn't handle access control correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly process the `simple_deny_groups` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect access control: When `simple_deny_groups` is specified, group members are incorrectly permitted access.
- The `simple_allow_groups` option will always deny access if any groups are added.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: Users who should be denied access based on group membership are allowed to log in. This bypasses the intended access controls.
- If `simple_allow_groups` is used then all users are denied access which could result in a denial of access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Configuration: The vulnerability is triggered by a specific configuration of SSSD as an Active Directory client with `simple_deny_groups` (or `simple_allow_groups`).
- No network attack is necessary since this is a flaw in how SSSD implements a core function when a particular option is set.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker doesn't require any specific capabilities besides having an account in the targeted Active Directory and being a member of a group that should be explicitly denied access.
- The attacker needs to use a system configured with the vulnerable SSSD version and configuration.
- Local access, authenticated or unauthenticated users may be able to trigger the vulnerability, however the flaw prevents the `simple_deny_groups` option from operating, so all users will be granted access, regardless of their actual group membership.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability exists in SSSD versions 1.9.0 and later due to the introduction of a new Active Directory provider.
- This flaw is present in both `simple_deny_groups` and `simple_allow_groups`.
- This can be triggered with either `simple_deny_groups` or `simple_allow_groups` options set. If the options are unset, all users are permitted access.

**Affected Products:**
- openSUSE 12.3
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
