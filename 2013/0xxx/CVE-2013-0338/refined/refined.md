{
  "CVE-2013-0338": {
    "Description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2 performed string substitutions when entity values for entity references replacement (--noent option) was requested / enabled during the XML file parsing. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when processed would lead to excessive CPU consumption (denial of service).",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way libxml2 performs string substitutions during entity expansion when the --noent option is enabled. Specifically, when an XML document contains an entity declaration with long replacement text and many references to that entity.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a specially crafted XML file to an application using libxml2. This attack leads to excessive CPU consumption and potentially memory exhaustion.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted XML file to an application that uses libxml2.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit an XML file to a vulnerable application that uses the libxml2 library with entity expansion enabled. No special privileges are required beyond this.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is a variant of the \"billion laughs\" attack. The attack uses an entity definition that expands to a very long string with many references, leading to linear complexity, but still triggering high resource consumption."
