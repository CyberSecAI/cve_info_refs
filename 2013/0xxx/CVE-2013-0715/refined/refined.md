Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an issue in the parsing of command strings within the VxWorks WebCLI component. The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The WebCLI component does not properly validate or sanitize command strings, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **CLI Session Login Required**: The attacker needs to authenticate and log in to a CLI session to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Valid Credentials**: The attacker must possess valid login credentials for a CLI session.
