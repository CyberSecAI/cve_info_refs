| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 5.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 4.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders.

## Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol does not specify unique LSA lookup identifiers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#229804

Original Release Date: 2013-08-02 | Last Revised: 2013-12-06

---

### Overview

The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol does not specify unique Link State Advertisement (LSA) lookup identifiers, which allow an attacker to intercept traffic or conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

### Description

| [**CWE-694**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/694.html)**: Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier**  The OSPF protocol requires LSA's to be identified by: LS Type, Advertising Router, and Link State ID. However, during the routing table calculation phase, the specification states that a LSA is queried in the LSA database using only the Link State ID. Since the Link State ID is used in the LSA database to identify a particular router, a malformed duplicate entry can cause unexpected and insecure implementation-specific behavior.In some implementations, the vulnerability can allow an attacker to subvert the routing table of victim router by sending false link state advertisements on behalf of other routers. This subversion can cause the victim router to drop the entire table (denial of service) or to re-route traffic on the network. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability can allow an attacker to re-route traffic, compromising the confidentiality of the data, or to conduct a denial-of-service attack against a router, dropping all traffic. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Install Updates**The OSPF protocol is a popular interior routing protocol that is used by many devices and manufacturers. This vulnerability is implementation-specific, so some vendors may not be affected. The list below contains known affected or non-affected vendors. Please consult your network equipment vendor to confirm how they are affected by this vulnerability. |

BULLETIN OVERVIEW
A security vulnerability, US-CERT Ref VU#229804, has been identified in the OSPF protocol. This
vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3 and is documented in the National Vulnerability Database as
CVE-2013-0149. See <http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm> for details.

Brocade produces and publishes Technical Support Bulletins to OEMs, partners and customers that
have a direct, entitled, support relationship in place with Brocade

Please contact your primary service provider for further information regarding this topic and
applicability for your environment.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
A security vulnerability, US-CERT Ref VU#229804, has been identified in the OSPF protocol. This
vulnerability requires that the attacker already controls a router within the AS.

RISK ASSESSMENT
The listed products are exposed to this vulnerability in the OSPF protocol, where the attacker already
has control of a router in the AS. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3.

SYMPTOMS
An attacker who has gained control of a router within a given AS can arbitrarily poison the routing
tables of all other routers in the AS. This can facilitate traffic subversion, black hole, etc.
The attacker can cause attacks through a crafted illegal OSPF router LSA (type-1); where the link state
ID & router ID in the LSA is not same; leading to corruption of routing table in the routers.
The crafted Router LSA must come from a source IP of an OSPF peer; in other words, spoofing a
legitimate OSPF peer. OR the router LSA is sent in the interface where an OSPF peer is existing
already.

WORKAROUND
There is no workaround. However if users can physically secure their network/routers, the chance of
this attack is quite low.
The recommendations are:
a) Physically secure the access to network routers, and links between routers.
b) Only allow passive OSPF protocols on interfaces with user/host connections, (i.e. leaf
interfaces).
c) Enable OSPF MD5 authentication
This is not considered completely secure, but it should make the attack more difficult.

1.Advisory Information

Title: Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol does not specify unique LSA lookup identifiers
D-Link ID: DLINK-2013-VUL0213
Advisory URL: TBD prior to Aug. 1, 2013
Date published: August 1, 2013
Date of last update: 7/29/13 (will update on saving document)
Reported by: CERT
Release mode: Coordinated Release

2.Vulnerability Information
Class: CWE-694
Impact: Critical
Remotely Exploitable: Possible, but would require access via other product (s)
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-0149
3.Vulnerability Description
The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol does not specify unique Link State
Advertisement (LSA) lookup identifiers, which allow an attacker to intercept traffic or
conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

This vulnerability can allow an attacker to re-route traffic through their own router,
compromising the confidentiality of the data, or to conduct a Denial of Service attack
against a router, dropping all traffic.

4.Vulnerable Packages
The following is the list of known affected devices and the associated firmware
(confirmed by D-Link). This will be updated as needed if additional units effected.
1. DES-3810-28 – R2.20.B017 (HW Not available in the US)

5.VendorInformation, Solutions and Workarounds
D-Link distributes a number of devices which could potentially be affected by this
vulnerability; chiefly, any L3 managed switch that supports OSPF has the possibility of
being subject to this attack.

D-Link is working to reduce the potential impact of this vulnerability, which is a result of
an ambiguous standard. Currently we advise the following:

As always, adhering to best practices will be the strongest defense against attacks. As
long as your physical devices, networks, and protocols are secured, it will be very
difficult for an attacker to insert a rogue LSA to initiate this type of attack.

First, this vulnerability does not defeat cryptographic (MD5) authentication, we
recommend a strong MD5 authentication key as your best defense.
We also recommend that administrators enable the OSPF passive interface feature to
stop sending or receiving routing table updates on interfaces that do not participate in
OSPF.

Finally, we recommend that networks use MAC-based Access Control (MAC) to
authenticate devices before they are able to communicate with the network. The MAC
feature is a client-less design so there is no need to install extra software on a user’s
computer, and ensures that only devices on a whitelist will have access to the network.
When used in conjunction with common security best practices, it can help to strongly
limit the possible vectors of attack.

D-Link is monitoring the situation for an update to the standard that can be implemented
to protect potentially affected devices.

7.Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

7.1.OSPF 𠇏ight Back” is triggered by LSAs with matching Router ID only, and so can
be evaded by using non matching Router ID and Link State ID on a rogue LSA. Routing
lookup uses only the Link State ID field, and so may, depending on implementation,
result in selecting the rogue LSA before the valid LSA.

### [Juniper Networks, Inc.](#BLUU-97KQ26) Affected

Notified:  May 10, 2013  Updated: December 03, 2013

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

LEGACY ADVISORY ID:

PSN-2013-08-987

PRODUCT AFFECTED:
All Juniper Networks platforms running Junos Operating System software, JunosE Operating System software, and ScreenOS software

PROBLEM:
 A vulnerability has been discovered in the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol that allows a remote attacker to insert, update, or delete routes in the OSPF database. Juniper has worked to provide fixes for all supported code that is vulnerable to this issue.

The issue lies in the OSPF protocol (RFC 2328: <http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt>). OSPF does not specify that the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields need to match when a router receives an OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA). This limitation of the protocol specification would allow for an attacker to inject false routes into the OSPF database. This issue doesn't exist if the OSPF configuration of a router is set to use MD5 Authentication, or if a filter is used to block external parties from sending OSPF link-state update (LSU) packets. This issue also does not apply to passive OSPF interfaces or interfaces that are not configured for OSPF.

This issue was discovered by an external security researcher.

No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.

This issue is being tracked as PR 878639 (Junos), CQ95773 (JunosE), and PR 895456 (ScreenOS).

KB16765 - "In which releases are vulnerabilities fixed?" describes which release vulnerabilities are fixed as per our End of Engineering and End of Life support policies.

WORKAROUND:
Juniper recommends that customers use MD5 authentication when configuring OSPF. MD5 authentication completely mitigates this issue as the router will not accept an LSA without the correct MD5 auth value.

It is good security practice to limit the exploitable attack surface of critical infrastructure networking equipment. Use access lists or firewall filters on physical interfaces (not loopback) to limit access to the router via OSPF unless necessary.

Customers can request a hotfix for this issue on JunosE may do so by contacting JTAC.

CVE-2013-0149

CVSS SCORE:
7.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:C)

RISK LEVEL:
High

RISK ASSESSMENT:
This issue could allow an remote attacker the ability to modify an OSPF database. For the issue to take place the attacker would need to have unfiltered access to an OSPF interface that is not using MD5 authentication. The attacker would be able to add routes, overwrite routes, and also clear the OSPF database. This attack could potentially allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or reroute traffic.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
 Juniper SIRT would like to acknowledge and thank Gabi Nakibly for responsibly reporting this vulnerability to CERT/CC who coordinated the multi-vendor response.

CORRECTED IN RELEASE:
See list of releases below.

BULLETIN OVERVIEW
A security vulnerability, US-CERT Ref VU#229804, has been identified in the OSPF protocol. This
vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3 and is documented in the National Vulnerability Database as
CVE-2013-0149. See <http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm> for details.

Brocade produces and publishes Technical Support Bulletins to OEMs, partners and customers that
have a direct, entitled, support relationship in place with Brocade

Please contact your primary service provider for further information regarding this topic and
applicability for your environment.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
A security vulnerability, US-CERT Ref VU#229804, has been identified in the OSPF protocol. This
vulnerability requires that the attacker already controls a router within the AS.

RISK ASSESSMENT
The listed products are exposed to this vulnerability in the OSPF protocol, where the attacker already
has control of a router in the AS. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3.

SYMPTOMS
An attacker who has gained control of a router within a given AS can arbitrarily poison the routing
tables of all other routers in the AS. This can facilitate traffic subversion, black hole, etc.
The attacker can cause attacks through a crafted illegal OSPF router LSA (type-1); where the link state
ID & router ID in the LSA is not same; leading to corruption of routing table in the routers.
The crafted Router LSA must come from a source IP of an OSPF peer; in other words, spoofing a
legitimate OSPF peer. OR the router LSA is sent in the interface where an OSPF peer is existing
already.

WORKAROUND
There is no workaround. However if users can physically secure their network/routers, the chance of
this attack is quite low.
The recommendations are:
a) Physically secure the access to network routers, and links between routers.
b) Only allow passive OSPF protocols on interfaces with user/host connections, (i.e. leaf
interfaces).
c) Enable OSPF MD5 authentication
This is not considered completely secure, but it should make the attack more difficult.

CORRECTIVE ACTION
See <http://My.Brocade.com> for the appropriate SW release(s) as listed below, please contact your
account team or Brocade Support if you have further questions.

This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing table, blackhole traffic, and intercept traffic.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe following Cisco Products have an OSPF implementation that is affected by this vulnerability. Refer to the Software Versions and Fixes section for information on fixed software.      **Cisco IOS Software**      Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software and configured for OSPF are vulnerable. Devices that do not have OSPF enabled are not affected by this vulnerability.       **Note:** This vulnerability can only be triggered by targeting the OSPF multicast address or directly targeting interfaces that are OSPF enabled.      OSPFv3 is not affected by this vulnerability. Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) protocol is not affected by this vulnerability.      To determine if a Cisco IOS device is configured with OSPF on an interface, use the **show ip ospf interface** command. The following is the output of the **show ip ospf interface** command on a Cisco IOS device configured with OSPF and enabled on the GigabitEthernet0/0/1 interface:    ```   Router#show ip ospf interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1 is up, line protocol is up Internet Address 192.168.2.4/24, Area 0, Attached via Network Statement Process ID 1, Router ID 10.10.10.4, Network Type BROADCAST, Cost: 1 Topology-MTID    Cost    Disabled    Shutdown      Topology Name       0           1         no          no            BaseTransmit Delay is 1 sec, State DR, Priority 1    ```       This vulnerability only affects Router LSAs (LSA type 1). As the result of exploitation of this vulnerability, the targeted router will have inconsistent information in its Router Link States LSA database, where the Link ID information will not match Advertising Router ID in the output of the **show** **ip ospf database** command.   The following is the output of the **show ip ospf database** command in a Cisco IOS device affected by this vulnerability:    ```   Router>show ip ospf database             OSPF Router with ID (10.10.10.1) (Process ID 1)     Router Link States (Area 0) Link ID         ADV Router      Age         Seq#       Checksum Link count10.10.10.4      10.10.10.4      334         0x8000000E 0x00E29A 310.10.10.1      192.168.27.11   22          0x80000011 0x0062A8 310.10.10.2      10.10.10.2      298         0x80000018 0x00394A 210.10.10.3      10.10.10.3      305         0x80000020 0x00E715 3    ```    **Note:** An affected targeted router will propagate the crafted LSA throughout the OSPF area. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, all the routers in the same OSPF area will have a copy of the crafted LSA Type 1 entry in the OSPF LSA database.      To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log into the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.      The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router>show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2009 by cisco Systems, Inc. Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS Reference Guide" at the following link:      <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>         ****Note:**** Cisco IOS XR is not affected by this vulnerability.         **Cisco IOS-XE Software**      Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS XE Software and configured for OSPF are vulnerable. Devices that do not have OSPF enabled are not affected by this vulnerability.       The version of Cisco IOS-XE Software that is running on a Cisco device can be determined using the **show version** command from the Command Line Interface (CLI).         **Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Cisco ASA Service Module (ASA-SM) and Cisco Pix Firewall**   Cisco devices that are running Cisco ASA or Cisco PIX Software and configured for   OSPF are vulnerable. Devices that do not have OSPF enabled are not   affected by this vulnerability.       The version of software that is running on a Cisco ASA, Cisco ASA-SM or Cisco Pix security appliances can be determined using the **show version** command from the CLI.         **Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM)**   Cisco devices that are running Cisco FWSM Software and configured for   OSPF are vulnerable. Devices that do not have OSPF enabled are not   affected by this vulnerability.       The version of software that is running on a Cisco FWSM can be determined using the **show version** command from the CLI.         **Cisco NX-OS Software**   Cisco devices that are running Cisco NX-OS Software and configured for   OSPF are vulnerable. Devices that do not have OSPF enabled are not   affected by this vulnerability.       The version of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on Cisco Nexus 3000, 5000, 6000 and 7000 series devices can be determined using the **show version** command from the CLI.      Exploiting the vulnerability on a Cisco Nexus device will not affect the local routing table of Cisco Nexus. However, the Cisco Nexus devices will install and propagate the crafted LSA to other devices in the OSPF area. Such crafted LSA propagated to other routers that are part of the same OSPF AS may affect the routing tables across the OSPF AS.       **Note:** Cisco Nexus 1000v Series is not affected by this vulnerability.         **Cisco ASR 5000**   Cisco devices that are running Cisco StarOS Software and configured for   OSPF are vulnerable. Devices that do not have OSPF enabled are not   affected by this vulnerability.       The version of software that is running on a Cisco ASR 5000 can be determined using the **show version** command from the CLI.         Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following Cisco products are not affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco IOS XR Software   + Cisco Connected Grid Routers   + Cisco Nexus 1000v Series   + Cisco Nexus 9000 Series   + Cisco Next Generation Wiring Closet (NGWC) No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * OSPF is a routing protocol defined by RFC 2328. It is designed to manage IP routing inside an AS. OSPF packets use IP protocol number 89.      Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability involving the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Routing Protocol Link State Advertisement (LSA) database. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing table, blackhole traffic, and intercept traffic.      The attacker could trigger this vulnerability by injecting crafted OSPF packets. Successful exploitation could cause flushing of the routing table on a targeted router, as well as propagation of the crafted OSPF LSA type 1 update throughout the OSPF AS domain.      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must accurately determine certain parameters within the LSA database on the target router. This vulnerability can only be triggered by sending crafted unicast or multicast LSA type 1 packets. No other LSA type packets can trigger this vulnerability.      OSPFv3 is not affected by this vulnerability. Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) protocol is not affected by this vulnerability.      Network devices running the OSPF protocol may be impacted by this vulnerability if they receive a crafted LSA type 1 packet. This packet does not have to be acknowledged, and it can originate from a spoofed IP address.   In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to determine a number of factors, such as the network placement and IP address of the target router, LSA DB sequence numbers, and the router ID of the OSPF Designated Router (DR). An attacker needs to know all of the factors in order to exploit this vulnerability.      Since OSPF processes unicast packets as well as multicast packets, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely and can be used to target multiple systems on the local segment simultaneously. Using OSPF authentication as described in the Workarounds section can mitigate the effects of this vulnerability. Using OSPF authentication is a highly recommended security best practice, regardless of the presence of this vulnerability.      Refer to <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute_ospf/configuration/guide/iro_cfg.html#wp1054174> for more information about Configuring OSPF.      Once processed, a crafted LSA type 1 packet may cause a directly targeted router to flush the content of its routing table and propagate the crafted LSA update throughout the OSPF area. OSPF member routers of the same area would be affected by processing and installing a crafted LSA type 1 packet propagated by the victim router. This may lead to a number of consequences, such as the injection of false routes into the OSPF routing table, the blackholing of traffic, or redirecting of traffic to a destination that is controlled by an attacker.      In order to recover affected systems, administrators can delete the OSPF configuration from the affected device and enable it again. Alternatively, a reload is required to recover affected systems. Clearing the OSPF process or routing table by means of commands such as **clear ip ospf process** or **clear ip route** does not have any effect and cannot be used to recover affected systems.      **Note:** All unfixed versions of Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco ASA Software, Cisco PIX Software and Cisco FWSM Software are affected by this vulnerability. A targeted device running affected software will flush the contents of its routing table and propagate the crafted LSA packet throughout the OSPF area.      This   vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco bug IDs:      + [CSCug34485](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug34485) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS     XE Software has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-0149   + [CSCug34469](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug34469) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco ASA and Cisco Pix has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-0149   + [CSCug39762](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug39762) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco FWSM has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-0149   + [CSCug63304](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug63304) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco NX-OS Software has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-0149   + [CSCug39795](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug39795) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco StarOS Software has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-0149  Workarounds  * The use of OSPF authentication is a valid workaround. OSPF packets without a valid key will not be processed. MD5 authentication is highly recommended, due to inherent weaknesses in plain text authentication. With plain text authentication, the authentication key will be sent unencrypted over the network, which can allow an attacker on a local network segment to capture the key by sniffing packets.      Refer to <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_configuration_example09186a0080094069.shtml> for more information about OSPF authentication.         Additionally, an OSPF Time To Live (TTL) security check can be applied as a partial workaround.    **Note:** This workaround is valid to protect against remotely triggered attacks and does not protect against attackers that are layer 2-adjacent to vulnerable devices.      For more information about general Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) hardening, refer to <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_configuration_example09186a0080094069.shtml>. Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory, which is available at the following link: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=29974>  Fixed Software  * For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory. When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/home.x), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.      The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.
