Root cause of vulnerability:
The OSPF protocol does not enforce that the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields need to match in a Link State Advertisement (LSA). This allows an attacker to inject false routes by sending a crafted LSA with a mismatched Link State ID and Advertising Router ID. During routing table calculation, some implementations only use the Link State ID for lookups, causing them to select the rogue LSA over a valid one.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Lack of validation on LSA fields: The OSPF protocol does not validate that the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields match.
- Inconsistent LSA lookup: Some OSPF implementations use only the 'Link State ID' during lookups in the LSA database, disregarding the 'Advertising Router' field.
- Acceptance of spoofed LSAs: Routers process crafted LSAs that don't originate from a legitimate OSPF peer without proper validation.

Impact of exploitation:
- Routing table corruption: An attacker can inject false routes into the OSPF database, leading to incorrect routing decisions.
- Traffic rerouting: An attacker can reroute network traffic through a path of their choosing, potentially intercepting it.
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the targeted router to drop its entire routing table or blackhole traffic.

Attack vectors:
- Crafted OSPF packets: The attacker injects crafted OSPF packets containing a malicious Router LSA (type-1).
- Spoofed source IP: The attacker spoofs the source IP of a legitimate OSPF peer or sends the crafted LSA on an interface with an existing OSPF peer.
- Target OSPF multicast address or enabled interfaces: Attackers can send crafted OSPF packets to the OSPF multicast address or directly target OSPF-enabled interfaces.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Control of a router within the OSPF AS or ability to inject packets into the AS.
- Knowledge of target OSPF network topology and addressing.
- Ability to craft OSPF packets including the ability to spoof source IPs.
- Ability to send packets to the target OSPF multicast address or target OSPF enabled interfaces.
