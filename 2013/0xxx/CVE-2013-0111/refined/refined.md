Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-0111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The NVIDIA Update Service Daemon (daemonu.exe) used an unquoted service path containing at least one whitespace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unquoted Service Path:** The vulnerability lies in the way the service path is defined. Because the path isn't enclosed in quotes, Windows service control manager can be tricked into executing a malicious file if a folder with a matching name is created in the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this to potentially escalate their privileges, gaining administrative control over the system.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability could potentially also lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack must be performed locally on the vulnerable machine.
*   **Malicious Executable:** An attacker must insert a malicious executable file into a directory within the service's unquoted path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the target system.
*   **File System Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to create directories within the service path and place the malicious executable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in NVIDIA drivers starting with version 173.01.
*   It is resolved in driver releases starting with version 311.00 (for Release 310) and version 307.78 (for Release 304).
*   The vulnerability affects Windows operating systems (Windows XP/Vista/7/8 - 32 & 64-bit).
