Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2013-0074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double dereference issue in Microsoft Silverlight when rendering HTML objects. This occurs because Silverlight incorrectly checks memory pointers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The primary weakness is an incorrect memory pointer check in Silverlight when handling HTML objects. This allows for unsafe memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the same privileges as the logged-in user. This can lead to:
    - Installation of programs.
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data.
    - Creation of new accounts with full user rights.
    - Complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:**
    - An attacker hosts a website with a malicious Silverlight application that exploits the vulnerability.
    - The attacker convinces a user to visit this website, usually by sending a link via email or instant message.
    - Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content/ads can also be used to deliver the exploit.
    - Attackers may use banner ads or other methods to inject malicious web content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must be able to host a website (or compromise an existing one) capable of delivering a malicious Silverlight application.
-   The attacker needs to convince users to visit the malicious website, or view the malicious content (e.g., through malvertising).
-   No special user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, but the impact is greater on users with higher privileges.
-  The attacker must create a specially crafted Silverlight application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Silverlight 5 and Microsoft Silverlight 5 Developer Runtime on Mac and all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.
-  The fix is included in Microsoft Silverlight build 5.1.20125.0 and later.
- Microsoft's Enhanced Security Configuration in Internet Explorer on Windows Servers is cited as a mitigating factor, but it is not a full protection and does not completely eliminate risk.
- Workarounds like disabling the Silverlight ActiveX control in the browser can help prevent exploitation, but they impact Silverlight functionality.
- EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) can be used as a further mitigation.

**Microsoft Exploitability Index:**

- The Microsoft Exploitability Index is a rating system that assesses the likelihood of exploitation.
- It assigns values from 0 (Exploitation Detected) to 3 (Exploitation Unlikely), based on exploitation trends, cost, and reliability of building an exploit. This specific rating is not stated, but this document generally describes how to evaluate the risk.
