## Foxit Advanced PDF Editor 3 contains a stack buffer overrun vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#275219

Original Release Date: 2013-01-25 | Last Revised: 2013-01-25

---

### Overview

Foxit Advanced PDF Editor 3, and possibly earlier versions, contains a stack buffer overrun vulnerability.

### Description

| Foxit Advanced PDF Editor 3, and possibly earlier versions, contains a stack buffer overrun vulnerability that may be exploited by an attacker that is able to successfully reconstruct the security cookie protecting the return address on the stack. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  [Foxit Advanced PDF Editor 3.04](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/downloads/#Foxit-Advanced-PDF-Editor/Windows) has been released to address this vulnerability. If a user is unable to upgrade, please consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. CERT/CC has created a [video tutorial for setting up EMET 3.0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_LUs_g0u4) on Windows 7. Note that platforms that do not support ASLR, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, will not receive the same level of protection that modern Windows platforms will.**Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows**Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document.Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: [On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/08/on-the-effectiveness-of-dep-and-aslr.aspx) for more details. |
