- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overrun vulnerability exists in Foxit Advanced PDF Editor 3, and possibly earlier versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow, which can be triggered if the attacker is able to reconstruct the security cookie protecting the return address on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed PDF file opened in the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a PDF file so that it will cause the buffer overrun. The attacker needs to successfully reconstruct the security cookie protecting the return address on the stack.
