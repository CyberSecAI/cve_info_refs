  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2013-0423",
    "description": "Oracle JDK: unspecified vulnerability fixed in 6u39 and 7u13 (Deployment)",
    "affected_versions": [
      "Java 7 Update 11 and earlier",
      "Java 6 Update 38 and earlier",
      "Java 1.6.0_37 and earlier for Mac OS X and OS X Server 10.6.8"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause is an unspecified vulnerability in the Deployment component of Oracle/Sun Java. It is one of many vulnerabilities addressed in the update.",
    "weaknesses": [
        "Unspecified vulnerability in the Deployment component",
        "Insecure handling of applets allowing privilege escalation",
        "Memory corruption allowing arbitrary code execution."
      ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system by convincing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document. Applications using Internet Explorer's web content rendering components (e.g., Microsoft Office) could also serve as attack vectors.  Java server applications may be vulnerable if processing untrusted data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted HTML documents.",
      "Compromised websites hosting malicious Java applets.",
      "Microsoft Office applications rendering web content.",
      "Java server applications processing untrusted data."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website or cause a Java server to process malicious data. No authentication is required, but in some cases user interaction is needed.",
