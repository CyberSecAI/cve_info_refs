  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2013-0756",
    "description": "Use-after-free in Javascript Proxy objects",
    "affected_products": [
      "Firefox",
      "Firefox ESR",
      "SeaMonkey",
      "Thunderbird",
      "Thunderbird ESR"
    ],
    "root_cause": "A garbage collection flaw in Javascript Proxy objects leads to a use-after-free.",
    "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `obj_toSource` function and its sub-functions within the JavaScript engine. Specifically, unrooted |jsid|s stored at |ida| (an IdArray) during the execution of `obj_toSource()` can be garbage collected due to actions during the execution of `obj->lookupGeneric()`. This happens because the `jsid`s are not properly rooted and the parent object from which they were retrieved is altered, leading to a dangling pointer when `ida->vector[i]` is accessed on subsequent iterations.",
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to a use-after-free.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this by creating a specially crafted JavaScript Proxy object with specific handler methods ('get', 'has', 'keys'). The 'has' method triggers garbage collection and heap spraying. The 'keys' method returns a bogus list of unrooted properties and calls the target object's toSource() method to trigger the use-after-free.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted web page or similar content to exploit the vulnerability. In Thunderbird and SeaMonkey, the vulnerability may be exploitable in browser contexts due to script execution.",
	"additional_notes": "This vulnerability was discovered by regenrecht via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI). It is described as a garbage collection flaw within Javascript Proxy objects. Patches were released on January 8, 2013 for Firefox 18, Firefox ESR 17.0.2, SeaMonkey 2.15, Thunderbird 17.0.2, and Thunderbird ESR 17.0.2"
