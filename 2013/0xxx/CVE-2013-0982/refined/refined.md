- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Permanent cookies were saved after quitting Safari, even when Private Browsing was enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of cookies in Safari's Private Browsing mode.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to a user's session may be able to log into previously accessed sites, even if Private Browsing was used. This compromises user privacy and potentially allows unauthorized access to accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have access to a user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to gain access to an active user session on a system that had been using Safari with Private Browsing enabled.
