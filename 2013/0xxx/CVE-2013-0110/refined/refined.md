Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The NVIDIA Stereoscopic 3D Driver Service (nvSCPAPISvr.exe) uses an unquoted service path which contains at least one whitespace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unquoted Service Path: The service path is not enclosed in quotes and contains whitespace, making it vulnerable to a "binary planting" or "unquoted service path" attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A local attacker can gain elevated privileges on the system.
- Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution: By placing a malicious executable in a path component of the service, the attacker can force it to be executed with elevated privileges when the service starts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the system.
- File System Manipulation: The attacker needs to insert a malicious executable into a directory in the service path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the target system.
- Write Access to a Path Component: The attacker needs write access to one of the directories in the unquoted service path.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in NVIDIA drivers starting with version 173.01.
- It is resolved in driver releases starting with version 311.00 (for Release 310) and version 307.78 (for Release 304).
- A patch (NVGuardService.exe) was also available for users who could not upgrade their drivers.
- The provided CVSS score is 6.8 (Base Score) with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C, which indicates a local attack vector with low complexity, requiring authentication, and resulting in complete impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
