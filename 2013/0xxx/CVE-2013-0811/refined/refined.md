Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a "use-after-free" error. This occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access a memory location that has already been freed or deallocated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is the improper handling of memory deallocation, leading to the use of freed memory. This can corrupt memory and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.
- The vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user. This means an attacker can gain the same level of access and permissions as the user.
- If the current user has administrative privileges, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-Based Attacks:**
    - Attackers can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability.
    - They can also leverage compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content or advertisements.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious site, typically by using phishing techniques like enticing links in emails or instant messages.
- **Email Attachments:**
   -  An attacker could also potentially exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTML email attachment that could trigger the vulnerability when opened.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker doesn't need to be local or have credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to use social engineering to trick users into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious email attachment.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided document covers multiple vulnerabilities addressed in the same Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS13-037). CVE-2013-0811 is one of the "Multiple Use After Free Vulnerabilities" that are discussed.
- The bulletin provides mitigations and workarounds, including:
  - Setting the Internet and Local intranet security zone to "High" to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting.
  - Configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable it.
  - Using the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) to manage security mitigations.
- The bulletin also mentions that Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2008 R2, and 2012 runs by default in Enhanced Security Configuration, mitigating the vulnerability.
- Microsoft had not received any reports of this vulnerability being publicly exploited when this security bulletin was originally issued.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jose Antonio Vazquez Gonzalez, working with VeriSign iDefense Labs.
