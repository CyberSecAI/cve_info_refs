Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-0424:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The RMI (Remote Method Invocation) component's CGIHandler class in OpenJDK uses user-supplied input in error messages without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The unsanitized user input within the error messages allows a remote attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page that is rendered by a Java process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful XSS attack could lead to:
*   Arbitrary script execution in the context of the user's session.
*   Session hijacking.
*   Redirection to malicious websites.
*   Information theft and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted request with malicious input via HTTP requests to the Java RMI component's CGIHandler class.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to an affected server.  No user interaction is mentioned in the description other than the initial http request, suggesting it can be exploited with a remote network connection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in OpenJDK and thus affects multiple products that use it.
*   Multiple sources mention this vulnerability being fixed in IcedTea versions, indicating that it is related to OpenJDK's implementation.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N), which means it has a "medium" severity rating as a remote attack which leads to some modification of data.
