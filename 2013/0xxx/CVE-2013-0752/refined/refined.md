In concern with remote XUL, this can lead to an exploitable crash. (CVE-2013-0752\n\nFrom bugzilla:\n\nSteps to reproduce:\nThe XBL file contains two XML bindings, \"pie\_chart\" and \"pie\_chart\_segment\".\nBoth contain SVG. When you insert \"pie\_chart\_segment\" into \"pie\_chart\" with the help of the <children/> XBL tag -- Firefox crashes.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Memory corruption due to improper handling of XBL files with multiple XML bindings and SVG content.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities:  Memory corruption, leading to an exploitable crash\n\nImpact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution\n\nAttack vectors: By crafting a malicious XBL file that includes multiple XML bindings with SVG content, and tricking a user into opening a webpage that uses this file via remote XUL (which is disabled by default but can be enabled by the user).\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to have the victim load a crafted XBL file and have remote XUL enabled.",
