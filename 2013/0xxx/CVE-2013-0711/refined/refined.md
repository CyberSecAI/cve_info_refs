Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2013-0711:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an issue in how the VxWorks SSH server (IPSSH) processes authentication requests. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from improper input validation when handling these requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The SSH server does not properly validate input during the authentication process, making it vulnerable to specially crafted requests.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary vulnerability is a DoS, where the server becomes unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- SSH access becomes unavailable: Exploiting the vulnerability results in the SSH server becoming unusable.
- System Unresponsive: The SSH access remains unavailable until the device is rebooted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is carried out remotely over the network.
- Specially crafted authentication requests: The vulnerability is triggered by sending malicious SSH authentication packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is needed: The attacker doesn't require any valid credentials to trigger the DoS, as it occurs during the authentication process itself.
- Low skill level: The exploit is relatively easy to execute, requiring little expertise or luck.
