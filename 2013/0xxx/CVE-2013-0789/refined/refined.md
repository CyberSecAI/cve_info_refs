Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0789:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2013-0789 in the openSUSE security update and in the Mozilla Security Advisory, confirming its relevance.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a set of "miscellaneous memory safety hazards" identified and fixed in the browser engine of Firefox and other Mozilla-based products, affecting the handling of JavaScript objects, regular expressions and layout rendering. 

Specifically, one of the root causes detailed was an issue in IonMonkey's handling of `js::GetObjectClass` where it was attempting to access memory with an invalid object pointer. Another root cause was the possibility of misinterpreting object types as RegExp objects which caused crashes when processing them. Finally there were issues with `nsTableFrame` which had issues with row-group continuations and memory corruption. These resulted from a lack of bounds checking, incorrect object handling and race conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

The weaknesses/vulnerabilities present include:

*   **Memory Corruption:** Several issues led to memory corruption, including out-of-bounds reads/writes and use-after-free conditions.
*   **Type Confusion:** Invalid type assumptions when processing regular expressions could lead to crashes and undefined behavior.
*   **Race Conditions:** Concurrent operations on shared objects led to use-after-free issues during garbage collection.
*   **Missing Checks:** Failure to perform proper checks for object validity and state led to exploitable issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By corrupting memory, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a user's system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashes and assertion failures would disrupt normal browser operation.
*  **Information Leakage**: Some vulnerabilities could lead to memory being leaked through rendered images.
*  **Bypassing Security Protections**: Vulnerabilities in the handling of  System Only Wrappers (SOW) could allow the Same Origin Policy to be bypassed and allow for cloned protected nodes.
*  **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**: Vulnerabilities using history navigation to load arbitrary web pages could allow cross-site scripting.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Pages:** Maliciously crafted web pages could trigger these vulnerabilities by exploiting JavaScript or layout bugs.
*   **Plug-ins:** Issues in plug-in handling could be triggered by malformed plug-in code.
*   **JavaScript:** Exploitation could involve crafted JavaScript code that manipulated objects, regular expressions, and call stacks.
*   **Specific Image Files**: Vulnerabilities could be triggered by loading specially crafted image files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to serve malicious content:**  The attacker needs to deliver the crafted web pages, javascript or other malicious code.
*  **User Interaction**: The user must interact with the malicious content that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (from Bugzilla comments):**

*   The bug report on the `js::GetObjectClass` crash (bug 842300) indicates that a corrupted object pointer was the cause.
*   The report on the "Assertion failure: \[infer failure] Missing type in object" (bug 831055) shows it was related to an issue with YARR (Yet Another Regular expression engine) on Win64 platforms.
*   The `nsDOMMediaStream` crash (bug 817841) was a result of a race condition during deletion, revealing an off-main-thread access issue.
*   The `nsTableFrame` issue (bug 815315) was related to incorrect handling of row-group continuations, causing an assertion failure.
*   The report on the `js::RegExpGuard::operator*` crash (bug 849014) detailed that object type checks were missing when calling regexp functions, allowing non-regexp objects to be passed in.

**Summary of Impact**
The vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2013-0789 allowed for a range of exploits from crashing the browser to enabling arbitrary code execution. The root causes generally stem from incorrect handling of objects and memory when the JavaScript engine is operating with either invalid memory addresses or invalid types. This allowed for attackers to leverage memory corruption bugs as well as circumvent security policies using type confusion to escalate privileges.
