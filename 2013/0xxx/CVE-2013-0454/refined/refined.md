Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-0454:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of CIFS share attributes within the Samba SMB2 server. Specifically, the server doesn't properly enforce the intended permissions, allowing for unauthorized access. The issue was in `source3/smbd/conn.c` where an incorrect assignment was made instead of a proper check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Assignment:**  The core problem lies in a flaw in the Samba code where share attributes were not correctly checked or assigned, leading to incorrect permissions being applied.
*   **Bypassing Intended Permissions:**  Due to the incorrect privilege handling, remote authenticated users could bypass the intended permissions set for CIFS shares. This leads to the following vulnerabilities.
*   **Write Access to Read-Only Shares:**  Authenticated users could gain write access to shares that were designated as read-only.
*   **Data Integrity Problems:**  Incorrect handling of the oplock, locking, coherency, or leases attribute could lead to data integrity issues.
*   **Unspecified Impacts:** There is also an unspecified impact due to the incorrect handling of the browseable or "hide unreadable" parameter of the share.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers could modify files on shares that were supposed to be read-only, leading to data corruption or manipulation.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Exploitation could trigger data integrity problems related to oplocks, locking, or leases.
*   **Information Disclosure**: An attacker could potentially view files that were intended to be hidden if the "hide unreadable" parameter was not handled correctly.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could be a stepping stone for further attacks, depending on the specific environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack occurs over the network using the SMB/CIFS protocol.
*   **Remote:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without needing physical access to the server.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be a valid, authenticated user on the affected network to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Samba server.
*   **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must have valid user credentials that allow them to authenticate to the SMB service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability specifically affects Samba versions that implement SMB2 support (3.6.0 through 3.6.5, fixed in 3.6.6).
*   Red Hat stated that their versions of Samba were not vulnerable as they either didn't have SMB2 support (RHEL5) or had newer versions that did not include the vulnerable code(RHEL6).
*   IBM Storwize V7000 Unified devices were affected.
*   Ubuntu addressed this vulnerability with a patch to their Samba package version 2:3.6.3-2ubuntu2.6.

This detailed explanation should provide a good understanding of the nature, impact, and exploitation of CVE-2013-0454.
