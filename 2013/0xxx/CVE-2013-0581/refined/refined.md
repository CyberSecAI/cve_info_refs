- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from the ability of a malicious attacker to intercept network requests from the client when a dashboard is opened or a service is executed. Subsequently, the attacker can modify the URL parameters of these requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of URL parameters, which allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute malicious code within the client browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the manipulation of URL parameters in network requests when a dashboard is opened or a service is executed. An attacker needs to be able to intercept these requests to modify them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network requests between the client and the server. This can be achieved through various methods such as man-in-the-middle attacks.
