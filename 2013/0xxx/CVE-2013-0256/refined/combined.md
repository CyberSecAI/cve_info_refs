## Topic

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.2.1, which fixes several security
issues, multiple bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager acts as a proxy for handling
subscription information and software updates on client machines.

The latest packages for Subscription Asset Manager include a number of security
fixes:

When a Subscription Asset Manager instance is created, its configuration
script automatically creates an RPM of the internal subscription service
CA certificate. However, this RPM incorrectly created the CA certificate
with file permissions of 0666. This allowed other users on a client system
to modify the CA certificate used to trust the remote subscription server.
All administrators are advised to update and deploy the subscription
service certificate on all systems which use Subscription Asset Manager
as their subscription service. This procedure is described in:
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Asset_Manager/1.2/html/Installation_Guide/sect-Installation_Guide-Administration-Upgrading_Subscription_Asset_Manager.html> (CVE-2012-6116)

Manifest signature checking was not implemented for early versions of
Subscription Asset Manager. This meant that a malicious user could edit
a manifest file, insert arbitrary data, and successfully upload the edited
manifest file into the Subscription Asset Manager server. (CVE-2012-6119)

Ruby's documentation generator had a flaw in the way it generated HTML
documentation. When a Ruby application exposed its documentation
on a network (such as a web page), an attacker could use a specially-
crafted URL to open an arbitrary web script or to execute HTML code
within the application's user session. (CVE-2013-0256)

A timing attack flaw was found in the way rubygem-rack and
ruby193-rubygem-rack processed HMAC digests in cookies. This flaw could aid
an attacker using forged digital signatures to bypass authentication
checks. (CVE-2013-0263)

A flaw in rubygem-json allowed remote attacks by creating different types
of malicious objects. For example, it could initiate a denial of service
(DoS) attack through resource consumption by using a JSON document to
create arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected. It
could also be exploited to create internal objects which could allow a SQL
injection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)

A flaw in ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails allowed remote attackers to
circumvent attribute protections and to insert their own crafted requests
to change protected attribute values. (CVE-2013-0276)

HTML markup was not properly escaped when filling in the username field in
the Notifications form of the Subscription Asset Manager UI. This meant
that HTML code used in the value was then applied in the UI page when the
entry was viewed. This could have allowed malicious HTML code to be
entered. The field value is now validated and any HTML tags are escaped.
(CVE-2013-1823)

These updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements:

* Previously, no SELinux policy for the subscription service was included

with the Subscription Asset Manager packages. The candlepin-selinux package
is now included with SELinux policies for the subscription server.
(BZ#906901)

* When attempting to use the subscription service's CA certificate to

validate a manifest during import, the comparison failed. The upstream
subscription service which generated the manifest is a different service
than the local subscription service; thus, they have different CA
certificates. This caused importing a manifest to fail with the error
'archive failed signature'. This has been fixed so that the proper
certificate is used for verification. (BZ#918778)

All users of Subscription Asset Manager are recommended to update to the
latest packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=907820#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-05 10:56:14 UTC  ``` A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Darkfish Rdoc HTML generator / template of RDoc, HTML and command-line documentation producing tool for Ruby, performed sanitization of certain values when creating Rdoc documentation. When Ruby on Rails application exposed its documentation via network, a remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL that, when opened would lead to arbitrary web script or HTML code execution in the context of (particular Ruby on Rails application) user's session.  This issue affects RDoc versions 2.3.0 to 3.12.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=907820#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-05 11:01:24 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the rubygem-rdoc package, as shipped with Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise, Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager, Red Hat CloudForms System Engine, and Red Hat CloudForms Cloud Engine.  --  This issue affects the versions of the rubygem-rdoc package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16, 17, and 18.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=907820#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-05 11:06:31 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Eric Hodel of RDoc upstream for reporting this issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=907820#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-05 10:56:14 UTC  ``` A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Darkfish Rdoc HTML generator / template of RDoc, HTML and command-line documentation producing tool for Ruby, performed sanitization of certain values when creating Rdoc documentation. When Ruby on Rails application exposed its documentation via network, a remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL that, when opened would lead to arbitrary web script or HTML code execution in the context of (particular Ruby on Rails application) user's session.

# USN-1733-1: Ruby vulnerabilities

21 February 2013

Several security issues were fixed in Ruby.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [ruby1.9.1](/security/cves?package=ruby1.9.1) - Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby

## Details

Jean-Philippe Aumasson discovered that Ruby incorrectly generated

predictable hash values. An attacker could use this issue to generate hash

collisions and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-5371](/security/CVE-2012-5371))

Evgeny Ermakov discovered that documentation generated by rdoc is

vulnerable to a cross-site scripting issue. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal

confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2013-0256](/security/CVE-2013-0256))

Thomas Hollstegge and Ben Murphy discovered that the JSON implementation

in Ruby incorrectly handled certain crafted documents. An attacker could

use this issue to cause a denial of service or bypass certain protection

mechanisms. ([CVE-2013-0269](/security/CVE-2013-0269))

  -
  [1.9.3.194-1ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ruby1.9.1/1.9.3.194-1ubuntu1.3)
* [libruby1.9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ruby1.9.1)
  -
  [1.9.3.194-1ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ruby1.9.1/1.9.3.194-1ubuntu1.3)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [ruby1.9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ruby1.9.1)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-08 05:19:00 UTC  ``` Aaron Patterson of Ruby on Rails project reports:   Denial of Service and Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability in JSON  There is a denial of service and unsafe object creation vulnerability in the  json gem. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  [CVE-2013-0269](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0269).  Versions Affected:  All. This includes JSON that ships with Ruby 1.9.X-pXXX Not affected:       NONE Fixed Versions:     1.7.7, 1.6.8, 1.5.5  Impact  ------  When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem can be coerced in to  creating Ruby symbols in a target system.  Since Ruby symbols are not garbage  collected, this can result in a denial of service attack.  The same technique can be used to create objects in a target system that act  like internal objects.  These "act alike" objects can be used to bypass  certain security mechanisms and can be used as a spring board for SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails.  Impacted code looks like this:      JSON.parse(user_input)  Where the `user_input` variable will have a JSON document like this:      {"json_class":"foo"}  The JSON gem will attempt to look up the constant "foo".  Looking up this  constant will create a symbol.  In JSON version 1.7.x, objects with arbitrary attributes can be created using  JSON documents like this:      {"json_class":"JSON::GenericObject","foo":"bar"}  This document will result in an instance of JSON::GenericObject, with the  attribute "foo" that has the value "bar".  Instantiating these objects will  result in arbitrary symbol creation and in some cases can be used to bypass  security measures.  PLEASE NOTE: this behavior *does not change* when using `JSON.load`.   `JSON.load` should *never* be given input from unknown sources.  If you are  processing JSON from an unknown source, *always* use `JSON.parse`.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the  work arounds immediately.   Releases  --------  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds  -----------  For users that cannot upgrade, please use the attached patches.  If you cannot  use the attached patches, change your code from this:      JSON.parse(json)  To this:      JSON.parse(json, :create_additions => false)  If you cannot change the usage of `JSON.parse` (for example you're using a gem  which depends on `JSON.parse` like multi_json), then apply this monkey patch:      module JSON       class << self         alias :old_parse :parse         def parse(json, args = {})           args[:create_additions] = false           old_parse(json, args)         end       end     end  Patches  -------  To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches  for the three supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist  of a single changeset.   * 1-7-VULN.patch - Patch for the 1.7 series * 1-6-VULN.patch - Patch for the 1.6 series * 1-5-VULN.patch - Patch for the 1.5 series  Credits  ------- * Thomas Hollstegge of Zweitag (www.zweitag.de) * Ben Murphy   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-08 05:20:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 694933](attachment.cgi?id=694933&action=diff "rubygem-json-1-5-CVE-2013-0269.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=694933&action=edit "rubygem-json-1-5-CVE-2013-0269.patch") rubygem-json-1-5-CVE-2013-0269.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-08 05:20:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 694934](attachment.cgi?id=694934&action=diff "rubygem-json-1-6-CVE-2013-0269.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=694934&action=edit "rubygem-json-1-6-CVE-2013-0269.patch") rubygem-json-1-6-CVE-2013-0269.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-08 05:21:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 694936](attachment.cgi?id=694936&action=diff "rubygem-json-1-7-CVE-2013-0269.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=694936&action=edit "rubygem-json-1-7-CVE-2013-0269.patch") rubygem-json-1-7-CVE-2013-0269.patch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-12 07:18:55 UTC  ``` Public via:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/4_YvCpLzL58> <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/9352>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-12 10:03:28 UTC  ``` Created ruby tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 910314](show_bug.cgi?id=910314 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-0269 rubygem-json: Denial of Service and SQL Injection [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-12 10:03:33 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-json tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 910313](show_bug.cgi?id=910313 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-0269 rubygem-json: Denial of Service and SQL Injection [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 910315](show_bug.cgi?id=910315 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2013-0269 rubygem-json: Denial of Service and SQL Injection [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c14)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-12 10:16:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 696457](attachment.cgi?id=696457&action=diff "Updated patch for 1.7 version") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=696457&action=edit "Updated patch for 1.7 version") Updated patch for 1.7 version  Updated patch for 1.7 version from:   [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/11/8>  From [1]: Hi,  I've attached an updated patch for the JSON gem.

FYI, [CVE-2020-10663](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10663) is extension of [CVE-2013-0269](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0269).  Since this gem is not supported from upstream now, we should update this to latest, raised regular bug for this: [bug 1862203](show_bug.cgi?id=1862203 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Satellite tools shipping old version of rubygem-json-1.4.6-2.el6")   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c38)  Yadnyawalk Tale    2020-07-31 07:08:04 UTC  ``` Added Red Hat Satellite 6 into the affect list and marked that notaffected.  (This may take time to populate in table)   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c39)  Yadnyawalk Tale    2020-07-31 07:12:49 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Satellite tools ship RubyGem Json 1.4.6 which is earlier than affected 1.5.5 version however, this version of RubyGem is not affected to the flaw. We may update RubyGem in a future release.   ```  [Comment 40](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c40)  sebastien.olivier    2020-07-31 11:57:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to Yadnyawalk Tale from [comment #39](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c39)) > Statement: >  > Red Hat Satellite tools ship RubyGem Json 1.4.6 which is earlier than > affected 1.5.5 version however, this version of RubyGem is not affected to > the flaw.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Moderate: ruby193-ruby, rubygem-json and rubygem-rdoc security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0701)

## Topic

Updated ruby193-ruby, rubygem-json and rubygem-rdoc packages that fix two
security issues are now available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

A flaw in rubygem-json and ruby193-rubygem-json allowed remote attacks by
creating different types of malicious objects. For example, it could
initiate a denial of service attack through resource consumption by using a
JSON document to create arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage
collected. It could also be exploited to create internal objects which
could allow a SQL injection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)

It was found that documentation created by rubygem-rdoc and
ruby193-rubygem-rdoc was vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
If such documentation was accessible over a network, and a remote attacker
could trick a user into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead to
arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's session. As
rubygem-rdoc and ruby193-rubygem-rdoc are used for creating documentation
for Ruby source files (such as classes, modules, and so on), it is not a
common scenario to make such documentation accessible over the network.
(CVE-2013-0256)

Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting
CVE-2013-0269, and Eric Hodel of RDoc upstream for reporting CVE-2013-0256.
Upstream acknowledges Thomas Hollstegge of Zweitag and Ben Murphy as the
original reporters of CVE-2013-0269, and Evgeny Ermakov as the original
reporter of CVE-2013-0256.

Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3 are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# XSS exploit of RDoc documentation generated by rdoc (CVE-2013-0256)

Posted by usa on 6 Feb 2013

RDoc documentation generated by rdoc bundled with ruby are vulnerable to
an XSS exploit. All ruby users are recommended to update ruby to newer
version which includes security-fixed RDoc. If you are publishing RDoc
documentation generated by rdoc, you are recommended to apply a patch
for the documentation or re-generate it with security-fixed RDoc.

## Impact

RDoc documentation generated by rdoc 2.3.0 through rdoc 3.12 and
prereleases up to rdoc 4.0.0.preview2.1 are vulnerable to an XSS
exploit. This exploit may lead to cookie disclosure to third parties.

## Details

The exploit exists in darkfish.js which is copied from the RDoc install
location to the generated documentation.

RDoc is a static documentation generation tool. Patching the library
itself is insufficient to correct this exploit. Those hosting rdoc
documentation will need to apply the following patch.

## Solution

Please apply the following patch to rdoc documentation. If applied while
ignoring whitespace, this patch will correct all affected versions:

```
diff --git darkfish.js darkfish.js
index 4be722f..f26fd45 100644
--- darkfish.js
+++ darkfish.js
@@ -109,13 +109,15 @@ function hookSearch() {
 function highlightTarget( anchor ) {
   console.debug( "Highlighting target '%s'.", anchor );
-  $("a[name=" + anchor + "]").each( function() {
-    if ( !$(this).parent().parent().hasClass('target-section') ) {
-      console.debug( "Wrapping the target-section" );
-      $('div.method-detail').unwrap( 'div.target-section' );
-      $(this).parent().wrap( '<div class="target-section"></div>' );
-    } else {
-      console.debug( "Already wrapped." );
+  $("a[name]").each( function() {
+    if ( $(this).attr("name") == anchor ) {
+      if ( !$(this).parent().parent().hasClass('target-section') ) {
+        console.debug( "Wrapping the target-section" );
+        $('div.method-detail').unwrap( 'div.target-section' );
+        $(this).parent().wrap( '<div class="target-section"></div>' );
+      } else {
+        console.debug( "Already wrapped." );
+      }
     }
   });
 };
```

And, if you are using ruby 1.9, please update [ruby-1.9.3 patchlevel
385](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/06/ruby-1-9-3-p385-is-released/). If you are using ruby 2.0.0 rc1 or prior or ruby trunk, please
update to ruby 2.0.0 rc2 or trunk revision 39102 or later. You can also
update RDoc itself with rubygems to RDoc 3.12.1 or RDoc 4.0.0.rc.2.

## Affected versions

* All ruby 1.9 versions prior to ruby 1.9.3 patchlevel 383
* All ruby 2.0 versions prior to ruby 2.0.0 rc2 or prior to trunk
  revision 39102

## Credit

This exploit was discovered by Evgeny Ermakov <corwmh@gmail.com>.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-0256.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0728)

## Topic

This update fixes one security issue in multiple rubygem packages for
Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

It was found that documentation created by RDoc was vulnerable to a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. If such documentation was accessible
over a network, and a remote attacker could trick a user into visiting a
specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in
the context of the user's session. As RDoc is used for creating
documentation for Ruby source files (such as classes, modules, and so on),
it is not a common scenario to make such documentation accessible over the
network. (CVE-2013-0256)

This update provides a number of updated rubygem packages that have had
their documentation regenerated with a corrected version of RDoc.

Red Hat would like to thank Eric Hodel of RDoc upstream for reporting this
issue. Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Ermakov as the original reporter.

Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3 are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=908613#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-07 07:06:11 UTC  ```  Description of problem:  User can muck with a manifest file, upload it and it will still parse (in most  reasonable cases, I imagine).   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  How reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: 1.  Get a manifest file. drill down into $manifest.zip > consumer_export.zip  > export > entitlements 2.  Modify the id value in the first line of the contained file.  If you want, go ahead and rename the file to match the id string you just modified. 3.  Attempt to import manifest file into CFSE    Actual results: Manifest file is imported.  Expected results: Manifest file should be rejected due to lack of signature integrity.  Additional info:   * Apparently a known backlog issue in candlepin - tracked here to assure  visibility in QE.  * Does this exist in the wild? If so, what's to stop a customer from staying  on any existing CFSE install and hacking away at a manifest to their heart's  content?  I know such changes used to get rejected.  Not sure how recent a  development this is.  External reference: <https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin/commit/f4d93230e58b969c506b4c9778e04482a059b08c>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=908613#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-26 19:17:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.2  Via RHSA-2013:0686 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0686.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=908613#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-07-26 07:38:29 UTC  ``` The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having moderate security impact in CloudForms 1.1. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.   ``` |  |
