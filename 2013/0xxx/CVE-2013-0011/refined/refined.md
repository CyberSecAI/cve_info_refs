Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-0011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Windows Print Spooler handles specially crafted print jobs. Specifically, the Print Spooler does not properly process certain malformed print data, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of specially crafted print jobs by the Windows Print Spooler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the target system with system-level privileges.
- Complete System Control: Successful exploitation could grant the attacker full control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a remote, unauthenticated attacker sending a specially crafted print job to a vulnerable print server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send print jobs to a vulnerable system running the Windows Print Spooler service.
- No authentication is required.

**Affected Systems:**
- Windows 7 (all editions)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (all editions)

**Mitigation:**
- Applying the security update (KB2769369) released by Microsoft.
- Disabling the Print Spooler service can also help mitigate the vulnerability but will disable print functionality.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" due to the potential for remote code execution.
- Microsoft was not aware of any public exploitation of the vulnerability when the security bulletin was released.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index for this vulnerability is 1, meaning exploitation is more likely.
- The provided documents include workarounds and details on how to apply the fix via Windows Update or manual download of the patch.
