Alert
# Exploit Tool Targets Vulnerabilities in McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO)

Last RevisedOctober 07, 2016
Alert CodeTA13-193A

### Systems Affected

McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO)

### Overview

A new exploit tool targets two vulnerabilities in McAfee’s ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO).

A new exploit tool specifically built to attack McAfee’s ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) targets two vulnerabilities found in ePO versions 4.6.5 and earlier. In order to exploit these vulnerabilities the attacker must be on the local network.

### Impact

The tool allows an attacker on the local network to add rogue systems to an enterprise ePO server, steal domain credentials if they are cached within ePO, upload files to the ePO server, and execute commands on the ePO server as well as any systems managed by ePO.

### Solution

**Identify Vulnerable ePO Versions**

To determine whether your instance of ePO is vulnerable, please refer to [KB52634](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB52634) and [KB59938](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB59938):

1. The ePO 4.x console is accessible only via a web interface and the Patch version (build number) will always be displayed in the Windows Internet Explorer title bar, including the first page where a user will log on to the ePO 4.x console.
2. For ePO 4.5 Patch 6, the Internet Explorer title will display the following information:

ePolicy Orchestrator 4.5.6 (Build: 137) -  Microsoft Internet Explorer

1. For ePO 4.6 Patch 5, the Internet Explorer title will display the following information:

ePolicy Orchestrator 4.6.5 (Build: 168) -  Microsoft Internet Explorer

**Update ePO**

This tool poses a significant risk to enterprises that use ePO and the following mitigation steps are strongly advised.

1. Upgrade ePO to one of the following versions:
   * ePO 5.0, released March 25, 2013;
   * ePO 4.5.7, released on May 23, 2013; or
   * ePO 4.6.6, released on March 26, 2013.

**Restrict Access to ePO**

Additionally, US-CERT recommends that administrators use dedicated remote administration consoles and set strict access controls that only allow specified systems to connect to the ePO server, reducing the potential attack surface.

## McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 4.6.4 and earlier pre-authenticated SQL injection and directory path traversal vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#209131

Original Release Date: 2013-04-29 | Last Revised: 2014-07-30

---

### Overview

McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 4.6.4 and earlier contains a pre-authenticated sql injection and directory path traversal vulnerability which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the system.

### Description

| McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 4.6.4 and earlier contains a pre-authenticated sql injection and directory path traversal vulnerability:   1. Server-side pre-Authenticated SQL Injection within the Agent-Handler component (Agent-Server communication channel).The attack is performed by registering a rogue Agent to the ePolicy Orchestrator server, and sending a crafted HTTP request to the ePolicy Orchestrator server. Successful attacks allow remote attackers to retrieve sensitive information from the ePo database (such as administrative domain credentials), to create additional web console administrator accounts, and to perform remote code execution with SYSTEM privilege. CVE-2013-0140 2. Server-side pre-Authenticated Directory Path Traversal within File upload process.The attack is performed by registering a rogue Agent to the ePolicy Orchestrator server, and sending a crafted HTTP request to the ePolicy Orchestrator server. Successful attacks allow remote attackers to upload unrestricted file content. A typical scenario would be to store malicious files under /Software/ folder, to make them available for download from the ePolicy Orchestrator server. CVE-2013-0141  The CVSS scores below apply to CVE-2013-0140. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with network access to the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator Agent-Handler (port tcp/443 by default) could upload arbitrary files under the ePolicy Orchestrator installation folder, gain read and write access to ePolicy Orchestrator database, or run arbitrary code on the ePolicy Orchestrator system. |
