  "CVE-2013-0419": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Java could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. The Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory for February 2013 addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Both Java applets delivered via web browsers and stand-alone Java applications are affected, however web browsers using the Java plug-in are at particularly high risk.",
    "root_cause": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities exist within the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Developer Kit (JDK). Specifically, a vulnerability exists in the Deployment component.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unspecified vulnerability in the Deployment component of Oracle Java.",
      "Insecure processing of untrusted data.",
       "Insufficient access control checks.",
      "Incorrect bounds checks.",
       "Deserialization issues.",
      "Integer overflow issues."

    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Java plug-in process. Stand-alone Java applications may also be affected.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Social engineering techniques to entice users to visit a link to a website hosting a malicious Java applet.",
      "Compromising a legitimate website and uploading a malicious Java applet (drive-by download attack).",
      "Exploiting vulnerabilities in stand-alone Java applications through processing untrusted data.",
         "Java plug-in, the Java Deployment Toolkit plug-in, and Java Web Start can be used as attack vectors."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to host or upload a malicious Java applet or JNLP file and lure a user into loading it."
