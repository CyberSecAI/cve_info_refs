Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-0092:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. Specifically, it involves the `GetMarkupPtr` function. This means that after the memory occupied by an object has been freed, a dangling pointer continues to point to that memory location. Accessing this freed memory can cause unexpected behavior, including arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when a program attempts to use memory after it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior.
- **Memory Corruption:** Accessing freed memory can corrupt the application's memory state. This corruption can be controlled by an attacker, making it possible to overwrite data or control program flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine within the security context of the currently logged-in user.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious website specifically crafted to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious website. This can be done through phishing emails, instant messages, or by compromising legitimate websites.
- **Compromised/Malicious Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised or malicious websites that are visited by the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host a Webpage:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage containing the exploit.
- **Ability to Lure Victims:** The attacker needs to lure victims into visiting the malicious webpage. This typically involves social engineering.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack is unauthenticated meaning no prior access is needed for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-021.
- The bulletin notes that the vulnerability affects a variety of Internet Explorer versions (6, 7, 8, 9 and 10) on multiple Windows client and server platforms.
- The update modifies how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory to prevent the use-after-free condition.
- Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can provide additional protection by making exploitation more difficult.
- Workarounds, such as setting the Internet and Local Intranet security zone settings to high, or disabling/prompting for Active Scripting, can provide some mitigation.
- This vulnerability was privately reported to Microsoft.

In summary, CVE-2013-0092 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability stemming from a use-after-free condition in Internet Explorer, where an attacker can leverage a malicious webpage to execute code on the user's machine.
