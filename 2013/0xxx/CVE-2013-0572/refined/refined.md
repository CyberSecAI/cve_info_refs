- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the web client functionality of the Document Connect for ASF feature, which allows a user to be tricked into inserting a malformed URL address into their browser or clicking on a malformed URL link.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Link injection and phishing through frames.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can collect sensitive data by tricking a user to interact with a malformed URL.
- **Attack vectors:** Malformed URL addresses or links that a user is tricked into using.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create and deliver the malformed URL to a user. The user also needs to be authenticated.
