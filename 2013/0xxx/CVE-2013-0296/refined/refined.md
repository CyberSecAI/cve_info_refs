{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "pigz creates temporary files with permissions derived from the umask, which may be less restrictive than the source file permissions. After writing the data to the temporary file, pigz correctly sets the file permissions. However, during the write operation the file might be readable by unintended users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a race condition related to file permission handling during compression. A temporary file is created with permissions determined by umask, which can be less restrictive than the original file. This leads to a window of opportunity where sensitive data may be exposed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can read the contents of a file during the compression process by pigz if the file has restrictive permissions (e.g., 0600). This bypasses the intended file access control.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to be in a position to observe the creation and writing of the temporary file by pigz while the compression is in progress.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user and have the ability to observe the file system and file permissions during the time pigz is running. The attacker also needs the user to compress a file with more restrictive permissions using pigz."
