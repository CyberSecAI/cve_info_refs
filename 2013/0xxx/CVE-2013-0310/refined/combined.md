## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 kernel update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0496)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, address several
hundred bugs, and add numerous enhancements are now available as part of
the ongoing support and maintenance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.
This is the fourth regular update.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A race condition was found in the way asynchronous I/O and fallocate()

interacted when using the ext4 file system. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to expose random data from an extent whose data blocks
have not yet been written, and thus contain data from a deleted file.
(CVE-2012-4508, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the vhost kernel module handled descriptors

that spanned multiple regions. A privileged guest user in a KVM guest could
use this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges
on the host. (CVE-2013-0311, Important)

* It was found that the default SCSI command filter does not accommodate

commands that overlap across device classes. A privileged guest user could
potentially use this flaw to write arbitrary data to a LUN that is
passed-through as read-only. (CVE-2012-4542, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the xen\_failsafe\_callback() function in the

Linux kernel handled the failed iret (interrupt return) instruction
notification from the Xen hypervisor. An unprivileged user in a 32-bit
para-virtualized guest could use this flaw to crash the guest.
(CVE-2013-0190, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way pmd\_present() interacted with PROT\_NONE

memory ranges when transparent hugepages were in use. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2013-0309, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way CIPSO (Common IP Security Option) IP options

were validated when set from user mode. A local user able to set CIPSO IP
options on the socket could use this flaw to crash the system.
(CVE-2013-0310, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Theodore Ts'o for reporting CVE-2012-4508, and
Andrew Cooper of Citrix for reporting CVE-2013-0190. Upstream acknowledges
Dmitry Monakhov as the original reporter of CVE-2012-4508. The
CVE-2012-4542 issue was discovered by Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat.

This update also fixes several hundred bugs and adds enhancements. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Release Notes for information on the most
significant of these changes, and the Technical Notes for further
information, both linked to in the References.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 users are advised to install these updated
packages, which correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Release Notes and
Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

cipso: don't follow a NULL pointer when setsockopt() is called

```
As reported by Alan Cox, and verified by Lin Ming, when a user
attempts to add a CIPSO option to a socket using the CIPSO_V4_TAG_LOCAL
tag the kernel dies a terrible death when it attempts to follow a NULL
pointer (the skb argument to cipso_v4_validate() is NULL when called via
the setsockopt() syscall).

This patch fixes this by first checking to ensure that the skb is
non-NULL before using it to find the incoming network interface.  In
the unlikely case where the skb is NULL and the user attempts to add
a CIPSO option with the _TAG_LOCAL tag we return an error as this is
not something we want to allow.

A simple reproducer, kindly supplied by Lin Ming, although you must
have the CIPSO DOI #3 configure on the system first or you will be
caught early in cipso_v4_validate():

	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <sys/socket.h>
	#include <linux/ip.h>
	#include <linux/in.h>
	#include <string.h>

	struct local_tag {
		char type;
		char length;
		char info[4];
	};

	struct cipso {
		char type;
		char length;
		char doi[4];
		struct local_tag local;
	};

	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		int sockfd;
		struct cipso cipso = {
			.type = IPOPT_CIPSO,
			.length = sizeof(struct cipso),
			.local = {
				.type = 128,
				.length = sizeof(struct local_tag),
			},
		};

		memset(cipso.doi, 0, 4);
		cipso.doi[3] = 3;

		sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
		#define SOL_IP 0
		setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_IP, IP_OPTIONS,
			&cipso, sizeof(struct cipso));

		return 0;
	}

futex: Forbid uaddr == uaddr2 in futex\_wait\_requeue\_pi()
commit 6f7b0a2a5c0fb03be7c25bd1745baa50582348ef upstream.
If uaddr == uaddr2, then we have broken the rule of only requeueing
from a non-pi futex to a pi futex with this call. If we attempt this,
as the trinity test suite manages to do, we miss early wakeups as
q.key is equal to key2 (because they are the same uaddr). We will then
attempt to dereference the pi\_mutex (which would exist had the futex\_q
been properly requeued to a pi futex) and trigger a NULL pointer
dereference.

m68k: Correct the Atari ALLOWINT definition
commit c663600584a596b5e66258cc10716fb781a5c2c9 upstream.
Booting a 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4-rc4 kernel on an Atari using the
`nfeth' ethernet device triggers a WARN\_ONCE() in generic irq
handling code on the first irq for that device:
WARNING: at kernel/irq/handle.c:146 handle\_irq\_event\_percpu+0x134/0x142()

After invoking the irq's handler the kernel sees !irqs\_disabled()
and concludes that the handler erroneously enabled interrupts.
However, debugging shows that !irqs\_disabled() is true even before
the handler is invoked, which indicates a problem in the platform
code rather than the specific driver.
The warning does not occur in 3.1 or older kernels.
It turns out that the ALLOWINT definition for Atari is incorrect.
The Atari definition of ALLOWINT is ~0x400, the stated purpose of
that is to avoid taking HSYNC interrupts. irqs\_disabled() returns
true if the 3-bit ipl & 4 is non-zero. The nfeth interrupt runs at
ipl 3 (it's autovector 3), but 3 & 4 is zero so irqs\_disabled() is
false, and the warning above is generated.
When interrupts are explicitly disabled, ipl is set to 7. When they
are enabled, ipl is masked with ALLOWINT. On Atari this will result
in ipl = 3, which blocks interrupts at ipl 3 and below. So how come
nfeth interrupts at ipl 3 are received at all? That's because ipl
is reset to 2 by Atari-specific code in default\_idle(), again with
the stated purpose of blocking HSYNC interrupts. This discrepancy
means that ipl 3 can remain blocked for longer than intended.
Both default\_idle() and falcon\_hblhandler() identify HSYNC with
ipl 2, and the "Atari ST/.../F030 Hardware Register Listing" agrees,
but ALLOWINT is defined as if HSYNC was ipl 3.
[As an experiment I modified default\_idle() to reset ipl to 3, and
as expected that resulted in all nfeth interrupts being blocked.]
The fix is simple: define ALLOWINT as ~0x500 instead. This makes
arch\_local\_irq\_enable() consistent with default\_idle(), and prevents
the !irqs\_disabled() problems for ipl 3 interrupts.
Tested on Atari running in an Aranym VM.

ALSA: hda - Fix mute-LED GPIO initialization for IDT codecs
commit 1f43f6c1bc8d740e75b4177eb29110858bb5fea2 upstream.
The IDT codecs initializes the GPIO setup for mute LEDs via
snd\_hda\_sync\_vmaster\_hook(). This works in most cases except for the
very first call, which is called before PCM and control creations.
Thus before Master switch is set manually via alsactl, the mute LED
may show the wrong state, depending on the polarity.
Now it's fixed by calling the LED-status update function manually when
no vmaster is set yet.

ALSA: hda - Fix mute-LED GPIO setup for HP Mini 210
commit a3e199732b8e2b272e82cc1ccc49c35239ed6c5a upstream.
BIOS on HP Mini 210 doesn't provide the proper "HP\_Mute\_LED" DMI
string, thus the driver doesn't initialize the GPIO, too. In the
earlier kernel, the driver falls back to GPIO1, but since 3.3 we've
stopped this due to other wrongly advertised machines.
For fixing this particular case, add a new model type to specify the
default polarity explicitly so that the fallback to GPIO1 is handled.

ALSA: hda - Fix invalid D3 of headphone DAC on VT202x codecs
commit 6162552b0de6ba80937c3dd53e084967851cd199 upstream.
We've got a bug report about the silent output from the headphone on a
mobo with VT2021, and spotted out that this was because of the wrong
D3 state on the DAC for the headphone output. The bug is triggered by
the incomplete check for this DAC in set\_widgets\_power\_state\_vt1718S().
It checks only the connectivity of the primary output (0x27) but
doesn't consider the path from the headphone pin (0x28).
Now this patch fixes the problem by checking both pins for DAC 0x0b.

tcp: perform DMA to userspace only if there is a task waiting for it
[ Upstream commit 59ea33a68a9083ac98515e4861c00e71efdc49a1 ]
Back in 2006, commit 1a2449a87b ("[I/OAT]: TCP recv offload to I/OAT")
added support for receive offloading to IOAT dma engine if available.
The code in tcp\_rcv\_established() tries to perform early DMA copy if
applicable. It however does so without checking whether the userspace
task is actually expecting the data in the buffer.
This is not a problem under normal circumstances, but there is a corner
case where this doesn't work -- and that's when MSG\_TRUNC flag to
recvmsg() is used.
If the IOAT dma engine is not used, the code properly checks whether
there is a valid ucopy.task and the socket is owned by userspace, but
misses the check in the dmaengine case.
This problem can be observed in real trivially -- for example 'tbench' is a
good reproducer, as it makes a heavy use of MSG\_TRUNC. On systems utilizing
IOAT, you will soon find tbench waiting indefinitely in sk\_wait\_data(), as they
have been already early-copied in tcp\_rcv\_established() using dma engine.
This patch introduces the same check we are performing in the simple
iovec copy case to the IOAT case as well. It fixes the indefinite
recvmsg(MSG\_TRUNC) hangs.

net: fix rtnetlink IFF\_PROMISC and IFF\_ALLMULTI handling
[ Upstream commit b1beb681cba5358f62e6187340660ade226a5fcc ]
When device flags are set using rtnetlink, IFF\_PROMISC and IFF\_ALLMULTI
flags are handled specially. Function dev\_change\_flags sets IFF\_PROMISC and
IFF\_ALLMULTI bits in dev->gflags according to the passed value but
do\_setlink passes a result of rtnl\_dev\_combine\_flags which takes those bits
from dev->flags.
This can be easily trigerred by doing:
tcpdump -i eth0 &
ip l s up eth0
ip sets IFF\_UP flag in ifi\_flags and ifi\_change, which is combined with
IFF\_PROMISC by rtnl\_dev\_combine\_flags, causing \_\_dev\_change\_flags to set
IFF\_PROMISC in gflags.

net: Fix references to out-of-scope variables in put\_cmsg\_compat()
[ Upstream commit 818810472b129004c16fc51bf0a570b60776bfb7 ]
In net/compat.c::put\_cmsg\_compat() we may assign 'data' the address of
either the 'ctv' or 'cts' local variables inside the 'if
(!COMPAT\_USE\_64BIT\_TIME)' branch.
Those variables go out of scope at the end of the 'if' statement, so
when we use 'data' further down in 'copy\_to\_user(CMSG\_COMPAT\_DATA(cm),
data, cmlen - sizeof(struct compat\_cmsghdr))' there's no telling what
it may be refering to - not good.
Fix the problem by simply giving 'ctv' and 'cts' function scope.

cipso: don't follow a NULL pointer when setsockopt() is called
[ Upstream commit 89d7ae34cdda4195809a5a987f697a517a2a3177 ]
As reported by Alan Cox, and verified by Lin Ming, when a user
attempts to add a CIPSO option to a socket using the CIPSO\_V4\_TAG\_LOCAL
tag the kernel dies a terrible death when it attempts to follow a NULL
pointer (the skb argument to cipso\_v4\_validate() is NULL when called via
the setsockopt() syscall).
This patch fixes this by first checking to ensure that the skb is
non-NULL before using it to find the incoming network interface. In
the unlikely case where the skb is NULL and the user attempts to add
a CIPSO option with the \_TAG\_LOCAL tag we return an error as this is
not something we want to allow.
A simple reproducer, kindly supplied by Lin Ming, although you must
have the CIPSO DOI #3 configure on the system first or you will be
caught early in cipso\_v4\_validate():
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
struct local\_tag {
char type;
char length;
char info[4];
};
struct cipso {
char type;
char length;
char doi[4];
struct local\_tag local;
};
int main(int argc, char \*\*argv)
{
int sockfd;
struct cipso cipso = {
.type = IPOPT\_CIPSO,
.length = sizeof(struct cipso),
.local = {
.type = 128,
.length = sizeof(struct local\_tag),
},
};
memset(cipso.doi, 0, 4);
cipso.doi[3] = 3;
sockfd = socket(AF\_INET, SOCK\_DGRAM, 0);
#define SOL\_IP 0
setsockopt(sockfd, SOL\_IP, IP\_OPTIONS,

[22766.601221] Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
It appears from his analysis and some staring at the code that this is likely
occuring because an association is getting freed while still on the
sctp\_assoc\_hashtable. As a result, we get a gpf when traversing the hashtable
while a freed node corrupts part of the list.
Nominally I would think that an mibalanced refcount was responsible for this,
but I can't seem to find any obvious imbalance. What I did note however was
that the two places where we create an association using
sctp\_primitive\_ASSOCIATE (\_\_sctp\_connect and sctp\_sendmsg), have failure paths
which free a newly created association after calling sctp\_primitive\_ASSOCIATE.
sctp\_primitive\_ASSOCIATE brings us into the sctp\_sf\_do\_prm\_asoc path, which
issues a SCTP\_CMD\_NEW\_ASOC side effect, which in turn adds a new association to
the aforementioned hash table. the sctp command interpreter that process side
effects has not way to unwind previously processed commands, so freeing the
association from the \_\_sctp\_connect or sctp\_sendmsg error path would lead to a
freed association remaining on this hash table.
I've fixed this but modifying sctp\_[un]hash\_established to use hlist\_del\_init,
which allows us to proerly use hlist\_unhashed to check if the node is on a
hashlist safely during a delete. That in turn alows us to safely call
sctp\_unhash\_established in the \_\_sctp\_connect and sctp\_sendmsg error paths
before freeing them, regardles of what the associations state is on the hash
list.
I noted, while I was doing this, that the \_\_sctp\_unhash\_endpoint was using
hlist\_unhsashed in a simmilar fashion, but never nullified any removed nodes
pointers to make that function work properly, so I fixed that up in a simmilar
fashion.
I attempted to test this using a virtual guest running the SCTP\_RR test from
netperf in a loop while running the trinity fuzzer, both in a loop. I wasn't
able to recreate the problem prior to this fix, nor was I able to trigger the
failure after (neither of which I suppose is suprising). Given the trace above
however, I think its likely that this is what we hit.

net: Fix memory leak - vlan\_info struct

In driver reload test there is a memory leak.
The structure vlan\_info was not freed when the driver was removed.
It was not released since the nr\_vids var is one after last vlan was removed.
The nr\_vids is one, since vlan zero is added to the interface when the interface
is being set, but the vlan zero is not deleted at unregister.
Fix - delete vlan zero when we unregister the device.

ext4: undo ext4\_calc\_metadata\_amount if we fail to claim space

The function ext4\_calc\_metadata\_amount() has side effects, although
it's not obvious from its function name. So if we fail to claim
space, regardless of whether we retry to claim the space again, or
return an error, we need to undo these side effects.
Otherwise we can end up incorrectly calculating the number of metadata
blocks needed for the operation, which was responsible for an xfstests

ext4: don't let i\_reserved\_meta\_blocks go negative
commit 97795d2a5b8d3c8dc4365d4bd3404191840453ba upstream.
If we hit a condition where we have allocated metadata blocks that

This condition is reproduced by xfstests 270 against ext2 with
delalloc enabled:

ext4: fix hole punch failure when depth is greater than 0
commit 968dee77220768a5f52cf8b21d0bdb73486febef upstream.
Whether to continue removing extents or not is decided by the return
value of function ext4\_ext\_more\_to\_rm() which checks 2 conditions:
a) if there are no more indexes to process.
b) if the number of entries are decreased in the header of "depth -1".
In case of hole punch, if the last block to be removed is not part of
the last extent index than this index will not be deleted, hence the
number of valid entries in the extent header of "depth - 1" will
remain as it is and ext4\_ext\_more\_to\_rm will return 0 although the
required blocks are not yet removed.
This patch fixes the above mentioned problem as instead of removing
the extents from the end of file, it starts removing the blocks from
the particular extent from which removing blocks is actually required
and continue backward until done.

Linear copy works by adding the offset to the buffer address,

Some tests I've written for prime\_pcopy show that the engine

NFS: Fix a number of bugs in the idmapper
commit a427b9ec4eda8cd6e641ea24541d30b641fc3140 upstream.
Fix a number of bugs in the NFS idmapper code:
(1) Only registered key types can be passed to the core keys code, so
register the legacy idmapper key type.
This is a requirement because the unregister function cleans up keys
belonging to that key type so that there aren't dangling pointers to the
module left behind - including the key->type pointer.
(2) Rename the legacy key type. You can't have two key types with the same
name, and (1) would otherwise require that.
(3) complete\_request\_key() must be called in the error path of
nfs\_idmap\_legacy\_upcall().
(4) There is one idmap struct for each nfs\_client struct. This means that
idmap->idmap\_key\_cons is shared without the use of a lock. This is a
problem because key\_instantiate\_and\_link() - as called indirectly by
idmap\_pipe\_downcall() - releases anyone waiting for the key to be
instantiated.
What happens is that idmap\_pipe\_downcall() running in the rpc.idmapd
thread, releases the NFS filesystem in whatever thread that is running in
to continue. This may then make another idmapper call, overwriting

I \*think\* that reading idmap\_key\_cons only once, before
key\_instantiate\_and\_link() is called, and then caching the result in a
variable is sufficient.

rpciod is trying to allocate memory for a new socket to talk to the
server. The VM ends up calling ->releasepage to get more memory, and it
tries to do a blocking commit. That commit can't succeed however without
a connected socket, so we deadlock.
Fix this by setting PF\_FSTRANS on the workqueue task prior to doing the
socket allocation, and having nfs\_release\_page check for that flag when
deciding whether to do a commit call. Also, set PF\_FSTRANS
unconditionally in rpc\_async\_schedule since that function can also do
allocations sometimes.

pnfs-obj: Fix \_\_r4w\_get\_page when offset is beyond i\_size
commit c999ff68029ebd0f56ccae75444f640f6d5a27d2 upstream.
It is very common for the end of the file to be unaligned on
stripe size. But since we know it's beyond file's end then
the XOR should be preformed with all zeros.
Old code used to just read zeros out of the OSD devices, which is a great
waist. But what scares me more about this situation is that, we now have
pages attached to the file's mapping that are beyond i\_size. I don't
like the kind of bugs this calls for.
Fix both birds, by returning a global zero\_page, if offset is beyond
i\_size.
TODO:
Change the API to ->\_\_r4w\_get\_page() so a NULL can be
returned without being considered as error, since XOR API
treats NULL entries as zero\_pages.

posix\_types.h: Cleanup stale \_\_NFDBITS and related definitions
commit 8ded2bbc1845e19c771eb55209aab166ef011243 upstream.
Recently, glibc made a change to suppress sign-conversion warnings in
FD\_SET (glibc commit ceb9e56b3d1). This uncovered an issue with the
kernel's definition of \_\_NFDBITS if applications #include
 after including . A build failure would
be seen when passing the -Werror=sign-compare and -D\_FORTIFY\_SOURCE=2
flags to gcc.
It was suggested that the kernel should either match the glibc
definition of \_\_NFDBITS or remove that entirely. The current in-kernel
uses of \_\_NFDBITS can be replaced with BITS\_PER\_LONG, and there are no
uses of the related \_\_FDELT and \_\_FDMASK defines. Given that, we'll
continue the cleanup that was started with commit 8b3d1cda4f5f
("posix\_types: Remove fd\_set macros") and drop the remaining unused
macros.
Additionally, linux/time.h has similar macros defined that expand to
nothing so we'll remove those at the same time.

This could previously fail if either of the enabled displays was using a

of the cursor was (supposed to be) visible at the right edge of that display.
The solution is to move the cursor one pixel to the left in that case.

which we can't do with the spinlock.
This drops the spinlock for the free operation and grabs it again before

As a result, the driver's add() ops may return success

For example, some BIOS may describe two ACADs in the same DSDT.
The second ACAD device will fail to register,
but ACPI driver's add() ops returns sucessfully.
The ACPI device will receive ACPI notification and cause OOPS.

commit f712c71f7b2b43b894d1e92e1b77385fcad8815f upstream.
Many firmwares have a common register definition bug where 8-bit
access width is specified for a 32-bit register. Ideally this should
be fixed in the BIOS, but earlier versions of the kernel did not
complain, so fix that up silently.
This closes kernel bug #43282:

workqueue: perform cpu down operations from low priority cpu\_notifier()
commit 6575820221f7a4dd6eadecf7bf83cdd154335eda upstream.
Currently, all workqueue cpu hotplug operations run off
CPU\_PRI\_WORKQUEUE which is higher than normal notifiers. This is to
ensure that workqueue is up and running while bringing up a CPU before
other notifiers try to use workqueue on the CPU.
Per-cpu workqueues are supposed to remain working and bound to the CPU
for normal CPU\_DOWN\_PREPARE notifiers. This holds mostly true even
with workqueue offlining running with higher priority because
workqueue CPU\_DOWN\_PREPARE only creates a bound trustee thread which
runs the per-cpu workqueue without concurrency management without
explicitly detaching the existing workers.
However, if the trustee needs to create new workers, it creates
unbound workers which may wander off to other CPUs while
CPU\_DOWN\_PREPARE notifiers are in progress. Furthermore, if the CPU
down is cancelled, the per-CPU workqueue may end up with workers which
aren't bound to the CPU.
While reliably reproducible with a convoluted artificial test-case
involving scheduling and flushing CPU burning work items from CPU down
notifiers, this isn't very likely to happen in the wild, and, even
when it happens, the effects are likely to be hidden by the following
successful CPU down.
Fix it by using different priorities for up and down notifiers - high
priority for up operations and low priority for down operations.
Workqueue cpu hotplug operations will soon go through further cleanup.

staging: zsmalloc: Finish conversion to a separate module
commit 069f101fa463351f528773d73b74e9b606b3f66a upstream.
ZSMALLOC is tristate, but the code has no MODULE\_LICENSE and since it
depends on GPL-only symbols it cannot be loaded as a module. This in
turn breaks zram which now depends on it. I assume it's meant to be
Dual BSD/GPL like the other z-stuff.
There is also no module\_exit, which will make it impossible to unload.
Add the appropriate module\_init and module\_exit declarations suggested
by comments.

s390/mm: fix fault handling for page table walk case
commit 008c2e8f247f0a8db1e8e26139da12f3a3abcda0 upstream.
Make sure the kernel does not incorrectly create a SIGBUS signal during
user space accesses:
For user space accesses in the switched addressing mode case the kernel
may walk page tables and access user address space via the kernel
mapping. If a page table entry is invalid the function \_\_handle\_fault()
gets called in order to emulate a page fault and trigger all the usual
actions like paging in a missing page etc. by calling handle\_mm\_fault().
If handle\_mm\_fault() returns with an error fixup handling is necessary.
For the switched addressing mode case all errors need to be mapped to
-EFAULT, so that the calling uaccess function can return -EFAULT to
user space.
Unfortunately the \_\_handle\_fault() incorrectly calls do\_sigbus() if
VM\_FAULT\_SIGBUS is set. This however should only happen if a page fault
was triggered by a user space instruction. For kernel mode uaccesses
the correct action is to only return -EFAULT.
So user space may incorrectly see SIGBUS signals because of this bug.
For current machines this would only be possible for the switched
addressing mode case in conjunction with futex operations.

commit 0f6f281b731d20bfe75c13f85d33f3f05b440222 upstream.
The downgrade of the 4 level page table created by init\_new\_context is
currently done only in start\_thread31. If a 31 bit process forks the
new mm uses a 4 level page table, including the task size of 2<<42
that goes along with it. This is incorrect as now a 31 bit process
can map memory beyond 2GB. Define arch\_dup\_mmap to do the downgrade

s390/idle: fix sequence handling vs cpu hotplug
commit 0008204ffe85d23382d6fd0f971f3f0fbe70bae2 upstream.
The s390 idle accounting code uses a sequence counter which gets used
when the per cpu idle statistics get updated and read.
One assumption on read access is that only when the sequence counter is
even and did not change while reading all values the result is valid.
On cpu hotplug however the per cpu data structure gets initialized via
a cpu hotplug notifier on CPU\_ONLINE.
CPU\_ONLINE however is too late, since the onlined cpu is already running
and might access the per cpu data. Worst case is that the data structure
gets initialized while an idle thread is updating its idle statistics.
This will result in an uneven sequence counter after an update.
As a result user space tools like top, which access /proc/stat in order
to get idle stats, will busy loop waiting for the sequence counter to
become even again, which will never happen until the queried cpu will
update its idle statistics again. And even then the sequence counter
will only have an even value for a couple of cpu cycles.
Fix this by moving the initialization of the per cpu idle statistics
to cpu\_init(). I prefer that solution in favor of changing the
notifier to CPU\_UP\_PREPARE, which would be a different solution to
the problem.

rtlwifi: rtl8192de: Fix phy-based version calculation
commit f1b00f4dab29b57bdf1bc03ef12020b280fd2a72 upstream.
Commit d83579e2a50ac68389e6b4c58b845c702cf37516 incorporated some
changes from the vendor driver that made it newly important that the
calculated hardware version correctly include the CHIP\_92D bit, as all
of the IS\_92D\_\* macros were changed to depend on it. However, this bit
was being unset for dual-mac, dual-phy devices. The vendor driver
behavior was modified to not do this, but unfortunately this change was
not picked up along with the others. This caused scanning in the 2.4GHz
band to be broken, and possibly other bugs as well.
This patch brings the version calculation logic in parity with the
vendor driver in this regard, and in doing so fixes the regression.
However, the version calculation code in general continues to be largely
incoherent and messy, and needs to be cleaned up.

rtlwifi: rtl8192cu: Change buffer allocation for synchronous reads
commit 3ce4d85b76010525adedcc2555fa164bf706a2f3 upstream.
In commit a7959c1, the USB part of rtlwifi was switched to convert
\_usb\_read\_sync() to using a preallocated buffer rather than one
that has been acquired using kmalloc. Although this routine is named
as though it were synchronous, there seem to be simultaneous users,
and the selection of the index to the data buffer is not multi-user
safe. This situation is addressed by adding a new spinlock. The routine
cannot sleep, thus a mutex is not allowed.

tun: fix a crash bug and a memory leak
commit b09e786bd1dd66418b69348cb110f3a64764626a upstream.
This patch fixes a crash
tun\_chr\_close -> netdev\_run\_todo -> tun\_free\_netdev -> sk\_release\_kernel ->
sock\_release -> iput(SOCK\_INODE(sock))
introduced by commit 1ab5ecb90cb6a3df1476e052f76a6e8f6511cb3d
The problem is that this socket is embedded in struct tun\_struct, it has
no inode, iput is called on invalid inode, which modifies invalid memory
and optionally causes a crash.
sock\_release also decrements sockets\_in\_use, this causes a bug that
"sockets: used" field in /proc/\*/net/sockstat keeps on decreasing when
creating and closing tun devices.
This patch introduces a flag SOCK\_EXTERNALLY\_ALLOCATED that instructs
sock\_release to not free the inode and not decrement sockets\_in\_use,
fixing both memory corruption and sockets\_in\_use underflow.
It should be backported to 3.3 an 3.4 stabke.

TPM: chip disabled state erronously being reported as error
commit 24ebe6670de3d1f0dca11c9eb372134c7ab05503 upstream.
tpm\_do\_selftest() attempts to read a PCR in order to
decide if one can rely on the TPM being used or not.
The function that's used by \_\_tpm\_pcr\_read() does not
expect the TPM to be disabled or deactivated, and if so,
reports an error.
It's fine if the TPM returns this error when trying to
use it for the first time after a power cycle, but it's
definitely not if it already returned success for a
previous attempt to read one of its PCRs.
The tpm\_do\_selftest() was modified so that the driver only
reports this return code as an error when it really is.

ftrace: Disable function tracing during suspend/resume and hibernation, again
commit 443772d408a25af62498793f6f805ce3c559309a upstream.
If function tracing is enabled for some of the low-level suspend/resume
functions, it leads to triple fault during resume from suspend, ultimately
ending up in a reboot instead of a resume (or a total refusal to come out
of suspended state, on some machines).
This issue was explained in more detail in commit f42ac38c59e0a03d (ftrace:
disable tracing for suspend to ram). However, the changes made by that commit
got reverted by commit cbe2f5a6e84eebb (tracing: allow tracing of
suspend/resume & hibernation code again). So, unfortunately since things are
not yet robust enough to allow tracing of low-level suspend/resume functions,
suspend/resume is still broken when ftrace is enabled.
So fix this by disabling function tracing during suspend/resume & hibernation.

Revert "usb/uas: make sure data urb is gone if we receive status before that"
commit c621a81edecdee85da32c566c21836332c764fda upstream.
This reverts commit e4d8318a85779b25b880187b1b1c44e797bd7d4b.
This patch makes uas.c call usb\_unlink\_urb on data urbs. The data urbs
get freed in the completion callback. This is illegal according to the
usb\_unlink\_urb documentation.
This patch also makes the code expect the data completion callback
being called before the status completion callback. This isn't
guaranteed to be the case, even though the actual data transfer should
be finished by the time the status is received.
Background: The ehci irq handler for example only know that there are
finished transfers, it then has go check the QHs & TDs to see which
transfers did actually finish. It has no way to figure in which order
the transfers did complete. The xhci driver can call the callbacks in
completion order thanks to the event queue. This does nicely explain
why the driver is solid on a (usb2) xhci port whereas it goes crazy on
ehci in my testing.

commit 31bde1ceaa873bcaecd49e829bfabceacc4c512d upstream.
A "usb0" interface that has never been connected to a host has an unknown
operstate, and therefore the IFF\_RUNNING flag is (incorrectly) asserted
when queried by ifconfig, ifplugd, etc. This is a result of calling
netif\_carrier\_off() too early in the probe function; it should be called
after register\_netdev().
Similar problems have been fixed in many other drivers, e.g.:
e826eafa6 (bonding: Call netif\_carrier\_off after register\_netdevice)
0d672e9f8 (drivers/net: Call netif\_carrier\_off at the end of the probe)

Fix is to move netif\_carrier\_off() to the end of the function.

ALSA: hda - Add support for Realtek ALC282
commit 4e01ec636e64707d202a1ca21a47bbc6d53085b7 upstream.
This codec has a separate dmic path (separate dmic only ADC),
and thus it looks mostly like ALC275.

ASoC: dapm: Fix \_PRE and \_POST events for DAPM performance improvements
commit 0ff97ebf0804d2e519d578fcb4db03f104d2ca8c upstream.
Ever since the DAPM performance improvements we've been marking all widgets
as not dirty after each DAPM run. Since \_PRE and \_POST events aren't part
of the DAPM graph this has rendered them non-functional, they will never be
marked dirty again and thus will never be run again.
Fix this by skipping them when marking widgets as not dirty.

ARM: OMAP2+: OPP: Fix to ensure check of right oppdef after bad one
commit b110547e586eb5825bc1d04aa9147bff83b57672 upstream.
Commit 9fa2df6b90786301b175e264f5fa9846aba81a65
(ARM: OMAP2+: OPP: allow OPP enumeration to continue if device is not present)
makes the logic:
for (i = 0; i < opp\_def\_size; i++) {
if (!oh || !oh->od) {
continue;
}
opp\_def++;
}
In short, the moment we hit a "Bad OPP", we end up looping the list
comparing against the bad opp definition pointer for the rest of the
iteration count. Instead, increment opp\_def in the for loop itself
and allow continue to be used in code without much thought so that
we check the next set of OPP definition pointers :)

SCSI: Avoid dangling pointer in scsi\_requeue\_command()
commit 940f5d47e2f2e1fa00443921a0abf4822335b54d upstream.
When we call scsi\_unprep\_request() the command associated with the request
gets destroyed and therefore drops its reference on the device. If this was
the only reference, the device may get released and we end up with a NULL
pointer deref when we call blk\_requeue\_request.

SCSI: Fix device removal NULL pointer dereference
commit 67bd94130015c507011af37858989b199c52e1de upstream.
Use blk\_queue\_dead() to test whether the queue is dead instead
of !sdev. Since scsi\_prep\_fn() may be invoked concurrently with
\_\_scsi\_remove\_device(), keep the queuedata (sdev) pointer in
\_\_scsi\_remove\_device(). This patch fixes a kernel oops that
can be triggered by USB device removal. See also
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg56254.html.
Other changes included in this patch:
- Swap the blk\_cleanup\_queue() and kfree() calls in
scsi\_host\_dev\_release() to make that code easier to grasp.
- Remove the queue dead check from scsi\_run\_queue() since the
queue state can change anyway at any point in that function
where the queue lock is not held.
- Remove the queue dead check from the start of scsi\_request\_fn()
since it is redundant with the scsi\_device\_online() check.

SCSI: fix eh wakeup (scsi\_schedule\_eh vs scsi\_restart\_operations)
commit 57fc2e335fd3c2f898ee73570dc81426c28dc7b4 upstream.
Rapid ata hotplug on a libsas controller results in cases where libsas
is waiting indefinitely on eh to perform an ata probe.
A race exists between scsi\_schedule\_eh() and scsi\_restart\_operations()
in the case when scsi\_restart\_operations() issues i/o to other devices
in the sas domain. When this happens the host state transitions from
SHOST\_RECOVERY (set by scsi\_schedule\_eh) back to SHOST\_RUNNING and
->host\_busy is non-zero so we put the eh thread to sleep even though
->host\_eh\_scheduled is active.
Before putting the error handler to sleep we need to check if the
host\_state needs to return to SHOST\_RECOVERY for another trip through
eh. Since i/o that is released by scsi\_restart\_operations has been
blocked for at least one eh cycle, this implementation allows those
i/o's to run before another eh cycle starts to discourage hung task
timeouts.

commit 198439e4 [SCSI] libsas: do not set res = 0 in sas\_ex\_discover\_dev()
commit 19252de6 [SCSI] libsas: fix wide port hotplug issues
The above commits seem to have confused the return value of
sas\_ex\_discover\_dev which is non-zero on failure and
sas\_ex\_join\_wide\_port which just indicates short circuiting discovery on
already established ports. The result is random discovery failures
depending on configuration.
Calls to sas\_ex\_join\_wide\_port are the source of the trouble as its
return value is errantly assigned to 'res'. Convert it to bool and stop
returning its result up the stack.

powerpc/85xx: use the BRx registers to enable indirect mode on the P1022DS
commit 6bd825f02966be8ba544047cab313d6032c23819 upstream.
In order to enable the DIU video controller on the P1022DS, the FPGA needs
to be switched to "indirect mode", where the localbus is disabled and
the FPGA is accessed via writes to localbus chip select signals CS0 and CS1.
To obtain the address of CS0 and CS1, the platform driver uses an "indirect
pixis mode" device tree node. This node assumes that the localbus 'ranges'
property is sorted in chip-select order. That is, reg value 0 maps to
CS0, reg value 1 maps to CS1, etc. This is how the 'ranges' property is
supposed to be arranged.
Unfortunately, the 'ranges' property is often mis-arranged, and not just on
the P1022DS. Linux normally does not care, since it does not program the
localbus. But the indirect-mode code on the P1022DS does care.
The "proper" fix is to have U-Boot fix the 'ranges' property, but this would
be too cumbersome. The names and 'reg' properties of all the localbus
devices would also need to be updated, and determining which localbus device
maps to which chip select is board-specific.
Instead, we determine the CS0/CS1 base addresses the same way that U-boot
does -- by reading the BRx registers directly and mapping them to physical
addresses. This code is simpler and more reliable, and it does not require
a U-boot or device tree change.
Since the indirect pixis device tree node is no longer needed, the node is
deleted from the DTS.

mmc: sdhci: fix incorrect command used in tuning
commit 473b095a72a95ba719905b1f2e82cd18d099a427 upstream.
For SD hosts using retuning mode 1, when retuning timer expired, it will
need to do retuning in sdhci\_request before processing the actual
request. But the retuning command is fixed: cmd19 for SD card and cmd21
for eMMC card, so we can't use the original request's command to do the
tuning.
And since the tuning command depends on the card type attached to the
host, we will need to know the card type to use the correct tuning
command.

mmc: sdhci-pci: CaFe has broken card detection
commit 55fc05b7414274f17795cd0e8a3b1546f3649d5e upstream.
At http://dev.laptop.org/ticket/11980 we have determined that the
Marvell CaFe SDHCI controller reports bad card presence during
resume. It reports that no card is present even when it is.
This is a regression -- resume worked back around 2.6.37.
Around 400ms after resuming, a "card inserted" interrupt is
generated, at which point it starts reporting presence.
Work around this hardware oddity by setting the
SDHCI\_QUIRK\_BROKEN\_CARD\_DETECTION flag.

iscsi-target: Drop bogus struct file usage for iSCSI/SCTP
commit bf6932f44a7b3fa7e2246a8b18a44670e5eab6c2 upstream.
From Al Viro:
BTW, speaking of struct file treatment related to sockets -
there's this piece of code in iscsi:
/\*
\* The SCTP stack needs struct socket->file.
\*/
if ((np->np\_network\_transport == ISCSI\_SCTP\_TCP) ||
(np->np\_network\_transport == ISCSI\_SCTP\_UDP)) {
if (!new\_sock->file) {
new\_sock->file = kzalloc(
sizeof(struct file), GFP\_KERNEL);
For one thing, as far as I can see it'not true - sctp does \*not\* depend on
socket->file being non-NULL; it does, in one place, check socket->file->f\_flags
for O\_NONBLOCK, but there it treats NULL socket->file as "flag not set".
Which is the case here anyway - the fake struct file created in
\_\_iscsi\_target\_login\_thread() (and in iscsi\_target\_setup\_login\_socket(), with
the same excuse) do \*not\* get that flag set.
Moreover, it's a bloody serious violation of a bunch of asserts in VFS;
all struct file instances should come from filp\_cachep, via get\_empty\_filp()
(or alloc\_file(), which is a wrapper for it). FWIW, I'm very tempted to
do this and be done with the entire mess:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=912905#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-02-20 00:37:08 UTC  ``` If a single descriptor crosses a region, the second chunk length should be decremented by size translated so far, instead it includes the full descriptor length. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, corrupt host memory.  Upstream fix: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=bd97120fc3d1a11f3124c7c9ba1d91f51829eb85>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=912905#c1)  Petr Matousek    2013-02-20 00:49:15 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=912905#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 07:03:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0496 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0496.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=912905#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-28 18:59:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2013:0579 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0579.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=912905#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-05-30 18:31:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 EUS - Server Only  Via RHSA-2013:0882 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0882.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=912905#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-06-11 17:39:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 EUS - Server Only  Via RHSA-2013:0928 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0928.html>   ``` |  |
