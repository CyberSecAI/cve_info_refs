{
  "CVE-2013-0310": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way CIPSO (Common IP Security Option) IP options were validated when set from user mode. A local user able to set CIPSO IP options on the socket could use this flaw to crash the system.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `cipso_v4_validate()` function in the Linux kernel does not properly handle a NULL `skb` (socket buffer) argument when called via the `setsockopt()` syscall, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing null check in the `cipso_v4_validate()` function, which attempts to access the network interface (`skb->dev`) without ensuring that `skb` is valid. When `setsockopt()` is called with CIPSO options, the `skb` argument can be NULL, leading to a crash.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local, unprivileged user can crash the system by setting CIPSO IP options on a socket.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local. A user with the ability to use `setsockopt()` on a socket can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local, unprivileged user capable of calling `setsockopt()` with CIPSO IP options."
