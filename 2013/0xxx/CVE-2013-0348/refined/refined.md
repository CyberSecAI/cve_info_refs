    "ID": "CVE-2013-0348",
    "content": "The vulnerability is that thttpd creates a world-readable log file by default.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The thttpd web server did not restrict the permissions of its log files after creation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure file permissions, specifically the log file is world-readable.  \n\n**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthorized user can disclose potentially sensitive information contained within the log file.\n\n**Attack vectors:** Local access to the system.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system, with no special privileges required.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was present in multiple Linux distributions, including Gentoo, openSUSE, and Fedora. The fix involves ensuring the log file's permissions are set correctly after it's created. The issue is related to the `fopen()` implementation in thttpd, which needs to be followed by a `chmod()` to set appropriate permissions.  A patch was created and pushed upstream to sthttpd.git to fix the issue."
