Subject: CVE-2013-0293 -- ovirt-node: Lock screen accepts F2 to drop to shell

F2 on the lock screen will cause the UI to drop to a root shell. This
means the screen is not really locked and an unprivileged user that has
access to the console or the ssh session can elevate his privileges.

Acknowledgements:

This issue was discovered by Mike Burns of Red Hat.

Versions affected:
oVirt Node 2.6.0-1

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

  Description     : Web based application for managing virtual machines

oVirt consists of two major parts: the "appliance" for managing the
virtual machines and the "nodes" where those VMs run on. Both are
currently being shipped as Fedora 9 based os images. Building a Debian
based node as well as packaging the web application will be quiet some
work, so help is certainly welcome.

Great idea. I will be help. I am changing employment and I will be
working in this new job with virtual machine orchestration system and
certainly I will be trying the oVirt. I could be helping to adapt the
oVirt to run over debian systems and helping with the packaging.

There are git archives at:

<http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-libvirt/ovirt/ovirt-server.git;a=summary>
<http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-libvirt/ovirt/ruby-libvirt.git;a=summary>

but they've not seen any activity for a long time. Help (or complete
takeover) of the packaging would be appreciated.
Cheers,
 -- Guido

retitle 502024 RFP: ovirt-node -- ovirt virtual machine node
noowner 502024
thanks

Hi,

This is an automatic email to change the status of ovirt-node back from ITP
(Intent to Package) to RFP (Request for Package), because this bug hasn't seen
any activity during the last 6 months.

If you are still interested in adopting ovirt-node, please send a mail to
<control@bugs.debian.org> with:

 retitle 502024 ITP: ovirt-node -- ovirt virtual machine node
 owner 502024 !
 thanks

However, it is not recommended to keep ITP for a long time without acting on
the package, as it might cause other prospective maintainers to refrain from
packaging that software. It is also a good idea to document your progress on
this ITP from time to time, by mailing <502024@bugs.debian.org>.

Thank you for your interest in Debian,
--
Lucas, for the QA team <debian-qa@lists.debian.org>
