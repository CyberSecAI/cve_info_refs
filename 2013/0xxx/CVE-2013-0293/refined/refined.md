Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-0293:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the lock screen functionality of oVirt Node where pressing the "F2" key would drop the user to a root shell.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Lock Screen Implementation:** The lock screen, intended to restrict access, failed to prevent unauthorized access to a root shell.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to access a root shell from the lock screen allowed an unprivileged user to gain full system control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system with root privileges.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** With root access, an attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored on the system.
- **System Instability:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the system's operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Console Access:** An attacker with direct physical access to the console of the oVirt Node can exploit this vulnerability.
- **SSH Session Access:** If an attacker has an existing SSH session (even with non-root privileges) to the vulnerable system, they can escalate their privileges via the lock screen.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unprivileged User Account:** An attacker needs to have a non-root user account on the target system (in case of SSH access).
- **Console or SSH Access:** The attacker requires either physical console access or SSH session access to the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mike Burns of Red Hat.
- The affected version was oVirt Node 2.6.0-1.
- The vulnerability does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 5 and 6.

The information provided gives a clear picture of how a simple weakness in the lock screen implementation can be exploited to gain root access on a vulnerable system.
