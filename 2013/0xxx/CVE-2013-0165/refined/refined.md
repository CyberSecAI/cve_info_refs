The provided content relates to CVE-2013-0165.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `dump.sh` script in the OpenShift mongodb cartridge creates a temporary directory in `/tmp` using a predictable name based on the process ID (`$$`). This predictable name and lack of proper checks allow for symlink attacks and other file system related vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Predictable temporary directory name:** The use of `$$` makes the temporary directory name predictable, allowing attackers to create files or symlinks in `/tmp` with the same name.
2.  **Missing checks on `mkdir` and `pushd`:** The script doesn't check the return code of `mkdir` which means it may fail but the script would continue. Similarly, `pushd` doesn't check if the target is a directory, causing it to potentially fail silently and operate in an attacker-controlled directory.
3.  **Unsafe `rm -Rf`:** The script uses `rm -Rf` to remove the temporary directory, which can be dangerous if an attacker creates symlinks, potentially leading to the removal of unintended files or directories.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Information disclosure:** An attacker can create a symlink to a directory they control, causing the database dump to be written to that directory and potentially reading the dumped data.
2.  **Data injection:** By creating a file with the same name as the temporary directory, an attacker could cause the `pushd` command to fail silently, then create a malicious archive in an attacker controlled directory.
3.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could fill the hard drive, or cause the mongod process to crash when it can not write a file, causing a potential denial of service.
4.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The unsafe `rm -Rf` could potentially be tricked into removing important data.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Symlink attack:** Creating symlinks in `/tmp` to intercept the temporary directory creation.
2.  **File creation attack:** Creating a file in `/tmp` with the name of the temporary directory to cause `pushd` to fail.
3. **Race condition**: exploiting a race condition between the temporary directory creation and symlink creation
4. **Hard drive filling**: Filling the hard drive to trigger mongod crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  The attacker needs to have the ability to create files and symlinks in the `/tmp` directory of the target system.
2.  The attacker needs to be able to trigger the execution of the vulnerable `dump.sh` script.
3. The attacker may need to be on a system where SELinux is not properly implemented for separation of users.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability was addressed by removing the vulnerable code.
*   Red Hat rated this issue as having Low security impact, due to the mitigation in place on OpenShift online.
*   The issue primarily affects users who do not follow recommendations for deploying OpenShift, particularly regarding SELinux usage.
