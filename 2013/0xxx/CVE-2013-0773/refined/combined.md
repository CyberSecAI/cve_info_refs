# USN-1729-2: Firefox regression

1 March 2013

Due to a regression, Firefox might crash or freeze under normal use.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

USN-1729-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update introduced a

regression which sometimes resulted in freezes and crashes when using

multiple tabs with images displayed. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Olli Pettay, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight,

Joe Drew, Wayne Mery, Alon Zakai, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Luke

Wagner, Terrence Cole, Timothy Nikkel, Bill McCloskey, and Nicolas Pierron

discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user

were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash.

([CVE-2013-0783](/security/CVE-2013-0783), [CVE-2013-0784](/security/CVE-2013-0784))

Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox could perform an out-of-bounds read

while rendering GIF format images. An attacker could exploit this to crash

Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0772](/security/CVE-2013-0772))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that Firefox did not properly handle some wrapped

WebIDL objects. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted

page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0765](/security/CVE-2013-0765))

Bobby Holley discovered vulnerabilities in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and

System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security

protections to obtain sensitive information or potentially execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0773](/security/CVE-2013-0773))

Frederik Braun discovered that Firefox made the location of the active

browser profile available to JavaScript workers. ([CVE-2013-0774](/security/CVE-2013-0774))

A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Firefox. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0775](/security/CVE-2013-0775))

Michal Zalewski discovered that Firefox would not always show the correct

address when cancelling a proxy authentication prompt. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and phishing attacks.

([CVE-2013-0776](/security/CVE-2013-0776))

Abhishek Arya discovered several problems related to memory handling. If

the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker

could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0777](/security/CVE-2013-0777), [CVE-2013-0778](/security/CVE-2013-0778), [CVE-2013-0779](/security/CVE-2013-0779), [CVE-2013-0780](/security/CVE-2013-0780),

[CVE-2013-0781](/security/CVE-2013-0781), [CVE-2013-0782](/security/CVE-2013-0782))

                 CVE-2013-1680 CVE-2013-1681

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
missing input sanitising vulnerabilities, use-after-free vulnerabilities,
buffer overflows and other programming errors may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, information leaks or
cross-site-scripting.

We're changing the approach for security updates for Iceweasel, Icedove
and Iceape in stable-security: Instead of backporting security fixes,
we now provide releases based on the Extended Support Release branch. As
such, this update introduces packages based on Firefox 17 and at some
point in the future we will switch to the next ESR branch once ESR 17
has reached it's end of life.

Some Xul extensions currently packaged in the Debian archive are not
compatible with the new browser engine. Up-to-date and compatible
versions can be retrieved from <http://addons.mozilla.org> as a short
term solution. A solution to keep packaged extensions compatible with
the Mozilla releases is still being sorted out.

We don't have the resources to backport security fixes to the Iceweasel
release in oldstable-security any longer. If you're up to the task and
want to help, please get in touch with team@security.debian.org.
Otherwise, we'll announce the end of  security support for Iceweasel,
Icedove and Iceape in Squeeze in the next update round.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.6esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.6esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-24

## Web content bypass of COW and SOW security wrappers

Announced
February 19, 2013
Reporter
Bobby Holley
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 19
* Firefox ESR 17.0.3
* SeaMonkey 2.16
* Thunderbird 17.0.3
* Thunderbird ESR 17.0.3

### Description

Mozilla developer **Bobby Holley** discovered that it was
possible to bypass some protections in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and System
Only Wrappers (SOW), making their prototypes mutable by web content. This could
be used leak information from chrome objects and possibly allow for arbitrary
code execution.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

It looks like there was originally an intention to do this for things like nativeCall and objectClassIs, but it was thwarted by document.domain. We can do it now, though, once [bug 800915](/show_bug.cgi?id=800915 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor wrapper hierarchy so that the result of PUNCTURE can be statically known") lands, and it'll be good defense-in-depth.

We're probably going to delay checking in this testcase one way or another, so I'm going to mark this as in-testsuite? to avoid forgetting.
We're probably going to want this on esr17, given that munging the prototypes on COWs is probably not good. This probably means backporting the first one or two patches from [bug 800915](/show_bug.cgi?id=800915 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor wrapper hierarchy so that the result of PUNCTURE can be statically known"). This shouldn't be so bad, though.Flags: in-testsuite?

You can also test this with any other builtin non-generic function. That is, anything that calls CallNonGenericMethod. js::regexp\_exec calls it, so:
var s = Cu.Sandbox("<http://www.example.com/>");
s.re = /f/;
Cu.evalInSandbox("RegExp.prototype.exec.call(re, 'abcdefg').index", s);
Run this as chrome code and it should throw; instead it runs and returns the correct answer (5).
Methods of Map and Date are also non-generic.

Arg, so this went all orange over SOWs. Looks like they need to be able to use nativeCall for system callers, which suggests that a dynamic check via enter() is what we need here. Working up some new patches.

Sigh, so this is a much bigger problem than I thought it was. Luke and I spent some time talking about this yesterday in MV, and I'll try to summarize here.
Theoretically, nativeCall only comes into effect when people try to call/apply a native-backed JSFunction with a |this| argument in another compartment. If the native operates on the object generically, this works fine. But if it does anything non-generic (like check the JSClass of the object), it won't work. So nativeCall is a mechanism designed to make this work.
However, when we did that trick to remap the prototypes for COWs into the home compartment, we thrust nativeCall much more into the spotlight. Now, \_any\_ nongeneric standard method that we invoke on a COW will go over nativeCall. So we're stuck between a rock and a hard place in terms of making this stuff transparent and making it secure.
Luke and I discussed this, and he thinks that COWs are generally a bad mechanism to expose real APIs to content. I tend to agree, though what should replace them is sort of up for debate. Regardless, while that's being hashed out, we still need to hand the security issues at play here.
It seems like the best we can do is to whitelist the natives we want to allow, and deny everything else. This is a bit tedious, but not so bad. Especially if we're no longer in the business of trying to make COWs seem 100% like real objects, and instead are just trying to make them secure without breaking anything that people have already started to use them for.
I'm going to make a list of all the instances of CallNonGenericMethod, and annotate which ones I think we should whitelist.

I doubt anyone is exposing maps to content. Let's deny unless it breaks something.

Rivertrail stuff. Waldo says it probably isn't relevant here.

This ends up toSource-ing the underlying objects. Since nativeCall makes this all happen in the content compartment, this will all happen without regard for \_\_exposedProps\_\_ and other access protections. Yikes. Let's kill it.

I'm not totally sure here, but my sense is that we shouldn't allow custom iterators / generators to work, because we don't know how to censor them.

No harm in allowing these, I'd think.

This is kind of a tricky one. If we allow anything, I think we need to allow date\_valueOf\_impl, which means that all the information from the getters is also exposed. We definitely shouldn't expose the setters though. So we should either whitelist only the readonly methods, or blacklist everything. The latter approach involves some small fixing in the B2G contacts API where date is valueOf-ed via a COW. Whitelisting the getterse is probably safest here.

We allow indexed access to typed arrays, so all of the "array-ish" data is rw accessible automatically. I'm still a bit fuzzy on what we should allow here, so I'm going to CC sfink. Definitely the length getter though.

I don't see a good reason to expose weakmaps across boundaries. Let's deny.

I looked through these, and I think I'd allow all of them. .byteLength is similar to .length, slice and subarray are just accessing the contents. Sharing the underlying buffer with other views probably can't be avoided, because you need it for casting and structure packing/unpacking.

Actually, it seems like you could at least make them read-only by disallowing

sicking says that B2G assumes it can expose typedarrays for read-write access, and doesn't do anything with ArrayBuffer and DataView. So I'm going to allow access for all the TypedArray stuff, and none of the other stuff.

Alright, so there are two big security issues that this fixes:
1 - Array.toSource can be used to bypass \_\_exposedProps\_\_ restrictions and view the contents of a chrome array without any filtering. Theoretically this is kind of bad, but in practice I doubt anyone's really relying on it.
2 - COW and SOW prototypes are mutable by content. This is a pretty big deal. Even though we fixed the \_\_exposedProps\_\_ inheritance issue in [bug 813901](/show_bug.cgi?id=813901 "VERIFIED FIXED - Chrome Object Wrapper can be bypassed using Object.prototype.__proto__"), there's still a host of other problems with letting content munge the prototypes of chrome objects.
I'm going to go with sec-high here.Keywords: [sec-other](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-other&resolution=---) → [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

Per [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=809652#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Have SecurityWrapper deny access for various sketchy SM extensions"), I think we should backport this, even though it's some work.
> Is this even needed for B2G18?
It affects B2G18 probably more than Desktop in the sense that there are more b2g APIs that use COWs (like contacts). The IPC hardening mitigates risk there, but it's still a big problem.

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): Longstanding
User impact if declined: Potential security hole
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Been on m-c and m-a for a while. This patch landed just after the merge, so the state of m-b now should be pretty similar to the state of the tree when this landed on m-c.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Medium risk. We should get it in soon if we're going to go for it.

Yes, we'll need this on mozilla-b2g18 - we're still discussing the risk of whether to land for v1.0.0

Its pretty late in the game to take defense in depth fixes for 1.0.0 esp. for a patch of this complexity, but maybe I misunderstand the bug. Is there a specific vulnerability we are fixing here?

This does fix a vulnerability, which is that content can arbitrarily change the proto of any privileged object it can get its hands on. Whether or not that's a major security issue depends on the details of all the chrome objects b2g exposes to content (of which there are many).
Blake and I just talked about this in person. He was on the fence, but eventually said that he doesn't believe this is critical to fix for b2g18.

The main risk here would be addon breakage. In particular, some addon might be using COWs and expect to be able to do certain operations on those objects that are now denied. This isn't super likely though, because these operations only became available in Mozilla 17, and weren't widely publicized. The "moderate" risk rating here mostly has to do with the scope of the change, and that it might have various consequences with external code that are hard to predict.

The only major difference is that the backport here was trickier, but most of that complexity was captured in [bug 800915](/show_bug.cgi?id=800915 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor wrapper hierarchy so that the result of PUNCTURE can be statically known").

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Bobby Holley discovered vulnerabilities in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and

System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page and had scripting enabled, a remote attacker could exploit

this to bypass security protections to obtain sensitive information or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-0773](/security/CVE-2013-0773))

Frederik Braun discovered that Thunderbird made the location of the active

browser profile available to JavaScript workers. Scripting for Thunderbird

is disabled by default in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2013-0774](/security/CVE-2013-0774))

A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Thunderbird. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Thunderbird if scripting were enabled. ([CVE-2013-0775](/security/CVE-2013-0775))

Michal Zalewski discovered that Thunderbird would not always show the

correct address when cancelling a proxy authentication prompt. A remote

attacker could exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and phishing attacks

if scripting were enabled.

([CVE-2013-0776](/security/CVE-2013-0776))

Abhishek Arya discovered several problems related to memory handling. If

the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker

could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-0777](/security/CVE-2013-0777), [CVE-2013-0778](/security/CVE-2013-0778), [CVE-2013-0779](/security/CVE-2013-0779), [CVE-2013-0780](/security/CVE-2013-0780),

[CVE-2013-0781](/security/CVE-2013-0781), [CVE-2013-0782](/security/CVE-2013-0782))

Olli Pettay, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight,

Joe Drew, Wayne Mery, Alon Zakai, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Luke

Wagner, Terrence Cole, Timothy Nikkel, Bill McCloskey, and Nicolas Pierron

discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If a user

had scripting enabled and was tricked into opening a specially crafted

page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash. ([CVE-2013-0783](/security/CVE-2013-0783), [CVE-2013-0784](/security/CVE-2013-0784))
