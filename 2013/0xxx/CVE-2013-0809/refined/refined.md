Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-0809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **integer overflow flaw** in how the Java 2D component handles certain sample model instances. This overflow occurs during the processing of specially crafted image data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** A vulnerability in the 2D graphics component's sample model instance handling that leads to an integer overflow.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The overflow can corrupt the memory of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The memory corruption can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the virtual machine's privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the JVM. This could lead to a full system compromise in some circumstances.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability leads to memory corruption within the JVM process, which can cause instability or crashes.
*   **System Takeover:** Successful exploitation could result in unauthorized operating system takeover including arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacks:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network without requiring any authentication.
*   **Malicious Java Applets/JNLP files:** Attackers can exploit this flaw by enticing users to visit malicious web pages hosting specially crafted Java applets or JNLP (Java Network Launching Protocol) files.
*  **Drive-by Downloads:** Attackers can also compromise legitimate websites and upload malicious Java applets, leading to drive-by download attacks.
*   **Untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets:** These are the primary vectors, as they run in the Java sandbox with limited privileges.
*   **Multiple protocols:** The vulnerability is exploitable via multiple protocols.
*   **Internet Explorer rendering components:**  Applications using the Internet Explorer web-content-rendering components (e.g. Microsoft Office, Windows Desktop Search) are also potential attack vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely via network access.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed without any user authentication.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers may need to employ social engineering tactics to convince users to visit malicious web pages or open crafted files.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** Attackers need the ability to host a malicious applet or JNLP file and to direct a user to that content.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Components:** The vulnerability resides in the 2D component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Java SE versions 7 Update 15 and earlier, 6 Update 41 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 40 and earlier.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is addressed by updating to Java SE 7 Update 17 (7u17), Java SE 6 Update 43 and later versions. OpenJDK patches are available in IcedTea6 1.11.9, and 1.12.4 and IcedTea7 2.1.7, 2.2.7 and 2.3.8.
*   **Active Exploitation:** Reports indicate that this vulnerability was being actively exploited in the wild and exploit code was publicly available.

In summary, CVE-2013-0809 is a critical vulnerability in Java 2D handling that could allow remote attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems. The vulnerability was widely targeted, requiring users to update their java environments.
