# Java SE 7 Update Release Notes

 ![java](/a/tech/img/java-logo-v1.svg )

## Java SE 7 Update Release Notes

**Update Release Notes** summarize changes made in all Java SE 7 update releases. Note that bug fixes are cumulative, that is, bug fixes in previous update versions are included in subsequent update versions.

The version numbers are given for each update release, complete with build number. To determine the version of your JDK software, use the following command:

`java -version`

### Bug Database

In most cases, the bug ID number for each bug fixed is a link to the detailed bug report on the Bug Database (Bug Parade) web site. [Bug Database](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/index.jsp) enables you to file your own bug reports, add comments to existing bug reports, and vote for the bugs you consider most important.

**Current Version**

JDK 7 has reached end of public updates. Releases after 1.7.0\_80 are only available to Oracle Customers. For release notes on versions greater than 1.7.0\_80 please visit the [Java SE 7 Advanced and Java SE 7 Support release notes.](/java/technologies/javase/7-support-relnotes.html)

For more information on installation and licensing of Java SE Suite and Java SE Advanced, visit [Java SE Products Overview](/java/technologies/se-products.html).

**Special Note about Java SE for Business** - For relevant information regarding Java SE for Business, refer to [Java SE 7 Advanced and Java SE 7 Support Release Notes](/java/technologies/javase/7-support-relnotes.html).

## MGASA-2013-0088

| **Date:** | March 9rd, 2013 |
| --- | --- |
| **Affected releases:** | 2 |
| **Media:** | Core |

**Description:**

Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages fix security vulnerabilities:

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the 2D component handled

certain sample model instances. A specially-crafted sample model instance

could cause Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to

arbitrary code execution with virtual machine privileges (CVE-2013-0809).

It was discovered that the 2D component did not properly reject certain

malformed images. Specially-crafted raster parameters could cause Java

Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to arbitrary code

execution with virtual machine privileges (CVE-2013-1493).

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0603)

## Topic

Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

These packages provide the OpenJDK 7 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 7 Software Development Kit.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the 2D component handled
certain sample model instances. A specially-crafted sample model instance
could cause Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to
arbitrary code execution with virtual machine privileges. (CVE-2013-0809)

It was discovered that the 2D component did not properly reject certain
malformed images. Specially-crafted raster parameters could cause Java
Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to arbitrary code
execution with virtual machine privileges. (CVE-2013-1493)

This erratum also upgrades the OpenJDK package to IcedTea7 2.3.8. Refer to
the NEWS file, linked to in the References, for further information.

All users of java-1.7.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [openjdk-7](/security/cves?package=openjdk-7) - Open Source Java implementation

## Details

USN-1755-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 6. This update provides the

corresponding updates for OpenJDK 7.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly validate certain types

of images. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause OpenJDK to crash.

([CVE-2013-0809](/security/CVE-2013-0809))

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly check return values when

performing color conversion for images. If a user were tricked into

opening a crafted image with OpenJDK, such as with the Java plugin, a

remote attacker could cause OpenJDK to crash or execute arbitrary code

outside of the Java sandbox with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2013-1493](/security/CVE-2013-1493))

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Alert
# Oracle Java Contains Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedOctober 19, 2016
Alert CodeTA13-064A

### Systems Affected

Any system using Oracle Java 7, 6, 5 (1.7, 1.6, 1.5) including

* Java Platform Standard Edition 7 (Java SE 7)
* Java Platform Standard Edition 6 (Java SE 6)
* Java Platform Standard Edition 6 (Java SE 5)
* Java SE Development Kit (JDK 7)
* Java SE Development Kit (JDK 6)
* Java SE Development Kit (JDK 5)
* Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE 7)
* Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE 6)
* Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE 5)
* OpenJDK 6 and 6u
* IcedTea 1.x (IcedTea6 1.x)

All versions of Java 7 through update 15, Java 6 through update 41, and Java 5.0 through update 40 are affected.  Web browsers using the Java 5, 6 or 7 plug-in are at high risk.

### Overview

Oracle Java 7 update 15, Java 6 update 41, Java 5.0 update 40, and earlier versions of Java contain a vulnerability that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

An arbitrary memory read and write vulnerability in the Java JVM process could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. An attacker could use social engineering techniques to entice a user to visit a link to a website hosting a malicious Java applet. An attacker could also compromise a legitimate website and upload a malicious Java applet (a "drive-by download" attack).

Any web browser using the Java 5, 6, or 7 plug-in is affected. The Java Deployment Toolkit plug-in and Java Web Start can also be used as attack vectors.

Reports indicate this vulnerability is being actively exploited, and exploit code is publicly available.

Further technical details are available in Vulnerability Note [VU#688246](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/688246).

### Impact

By convincing a user to load a malicious Java applet or Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the Java plug-in process. Note that applications that use the Internet Explorer web-content-rendering components, such as Microsoft Office or Windows Desktop Search, may also be used as an attack vector for these vulnerabilities.

### Solution

**Update Java**

[Oracle Security Alert for CVE-2013-1493](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2013-1493-1915081.html) states that Java 7 Update 17 ([7u17](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u-relnotes-515228.html)) and and Java 6 Update 43 address this vulnerability (CVE-2013-1493) and a different but equally severe vulnerability (CVE-2013-0809).

Java 7 Update 17 sets the default Java security settings to "High" so that users will be prompted before running unsigned or self-signed Java applets.

**Disable Java in Web Browsers**

This and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered. To defend against these vulnerabilities, consider disabling Java in web browsers until adequate updates are available. As with any software, unnecessary features should be disabled or removed as appropriate for your environment.

Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to disable Java content in web browsers through the Java control panel applet. According to [Setting the Security Level of the Java Client](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable),

For installations where the highest level of security is required, it is possible to entirely prevent *any* Java apps (signed or unsigned) from running in a browser by de-selecting Enable Java content in the browser in the Java Control Panel under the Security tab.

If you are unable to update to Java 7 Update 10, see the solution section of Vulnerability Note [VU#636312](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312#solution) for instructions on how to disable Java on a per-browser basis.

## Oracle Java contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#688246

Original Release Date: 2013-03-05 | Last Revised: 2013-06-14

---

### Overview

Oracle Java 7 Update 15, Java 6 Update 41, Java 5.0 Update 40, and earlier versions contain a vulnerability that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows users to run Java applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Oracle has made the JRE available for multiple operating systems. OpenJDK is an open-source implementation of the Java platform, and the IcedTea project aims to make it easier to deploy OpenJDK, including a web browser plugin.  Additional details of the vulnerability can be found at FireEye Malware Intelligence Lab [blog post](http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2013/02/yaj0-yet-another-java-zero-day-2.html#more). This vulnerability is reportedly being exploited in the wild. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Note that applications that use the Internet Explorer web content rendering components, such as Microsoft Office or Windows Desktop Search, may also be used as an attack vector for these vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These issues are addressed in Java 7 Update 17 and Java 6 Update 43. Please see the [Oracle Security Alert for CVE-2013-1493](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2013-1493-1915081.html) for more details.Unless it is absolutely necessary to run Java in web browsers, disable it as described below, even after updating to 7u17. This will help mitigate other Java vulnerabilities that may be discovered in the future.This issue has also been addressed in [IcedTea versions 1.11.9 and 1.12.4](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/distro-pkg-dev/2013-March/022145.html). |
| --- |

| **Disable Java in web browsers**Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to [disable Java content in web browsers](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml) through the Java control panel applet. Please see the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable) for more details.**Note**: Due to what appears to potentially be a bug in the Java installer, the Java Control Panel applet may be missing on some Windows systems. In such cases, the Java Control Panel applet may be launched by finding and executing javacpl.exe manually. This file is likely to be found in C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin or C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin.**Also note** that we have encountered situations on Windows where Java will crash if it has been disabled in the web browser as described above and then subsequently re-enabled. Depending on the browser used, [Michael Horowitz has pointed out](http://blogs.computerworld.com/cybercrime-and-hacking/21664/understanding-new-security-java-7-update-11) that performing the same steps on Windows 7 will result in unsigned Java applets executing without prompting in Internet Explorer, despite what the "Security Level" slider in the Java Control panel applet is configured to use. We have confirmed this behavior with Internet Explorer on both Windows 7 and Vista. Reinstalling Java appears to correct both of these situations.System administrators wishing to deploy Java 7 Update 10 or later with the "Enable Java content in the browser" feature disabled can invoke the Java installer with the WEB\_JAVA=0 command-line option. More details are available in the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#install).Alternatively, Microsoft has released a [Fix it](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/05/29/java-when-you-cannot-let-go.aspx) that disables Java in the Internet Explorer web browser.**Restrict access to Java applets**Network administrators unable to disable Java in web browsers may be able to help mitigate this and other Java vulnerabilities by restricting access to Java applets. This may be accomplished by using proxy server rules, for example. Blocking or whitelisting web requests to .jar and .class files can help to prevent Java from being used by untrusted sources. Filtering requests that contain a Java User-Agent header may also be effective. For example, this technique can be used in environments where Java is required on the local intranet. The proxy can be configured to allow Java requests locally, but block them when the destination is a site on the internet. |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Oracle Security Alert for CVE-2013-1493

## Oracle Security Alert for CVE-2013-1493

### Description

This Security Alert addresses security issues CVE-2013-1493 (US-CERT VU#688246) and another vulnerability affecting Java running in web browsers. These vulnerabilities are not applicable to Java running on servers, standalone Java desktop applications or embedded Java applications. They also do not affect Oracle server-based software.

These vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., they may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. For an exploit to be successful, an unsuspecting user running an affected release in a browser must visit a malicious web page that leverages these vulnerabilities. Successful exploits can impact the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the user's system.

**Due to the severity of these vulnerabilities, and the reported exploitation of CVE-2013-1493 "in the wild," Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply the updates provided by this Security Alert as soon as possible**.

### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary This Security Alert contains 2 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  Both of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.   The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cve-2013-1493-verbose.html). The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

## Synopsis

Critical: java-1.7.0-openjdk security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0602)

## Topic

Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

These packages provide the OpenJDK 7 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 7 Software Development Kit.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the 2D component handled
certain sample model instances. A specially-crafted sample model instance
could cause Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to
arbitrary code execution with virtual machine privileges. (CVE-2013-0809)

It was discovered that the 2D component did not properly reject certain
malformed images. Specially-crafted raster parameters could cause Java
Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to arbitrary code
execution with virtual machine privileges. (CVE-2013-1493)

Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was
installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited
without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.

This erratum also upgrades the OpenJDK package to IcedTea7 2.3.8. Refer to
the NEWS file, linked to in the References, for further information.

All users of java-1.7.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-openjdk packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the 2D component handled
certain sample model instances. A specially-crafted sample model instance
could cause Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to
arbitrary code execution with virtual machine privileges. (CVE-2013-0809)

It was discovered that the 2D component did not properly reject certain
malformed images. Specially-crafted raster parameters could cause Java
Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to arbitrary code
execution with virtual machine privileges. (CVE-2013-1493)

This erratum also upgrades the OpenJDK package to IcedTea6 1.11.9. Refer to
the NEWS file, linked to in the References, for further information.

All users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.
