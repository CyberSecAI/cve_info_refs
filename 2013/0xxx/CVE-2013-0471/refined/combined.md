# Security Bulletin: TSM Client Scheduler Denial Of Service Vulnerability (CVE-2013-0471)

### Flashes (Alerts)

## Abstract

A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) client traditional scheduler

## Content

**DESCRIPTION:** A Denial of Service vulnerability in the TSM client traditional scheduler allows a remote attacker to disable the traditional scheduler when it is in Prompted mode (SCHEDMODE=PROMPTED). Once disabled, no more schedules (such as scheduled backups) will be run, and the TSM server log will show that schedules for that node are missed.
