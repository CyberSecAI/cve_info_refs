Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the traditional scheduler of the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) client. Specifically, the scheduler is vulnerable when running in "Prompted mode" (SCHEDMODE=PROMPTED).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in disabling the traditional scheduler.
- Once disabled, no scheduled operations (e.g., backups) will run.
- The TSM server log will record that schedules for the affected node are missed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed remotely.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the TSM client scheduler is in "Prompted Mode".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the TSM client scheduler remotely.
- The TSM client must be configured to use the traditional scheduler in "Prompted Mode."

**Affected Versions:**
- TSM Client versions 5.5, 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 are affected
- Patches are provided in version 6.4.0.1, 6.3.1 and 6.2.5 (when available)
- TSM for Space Management is affected on AIX and Linux
- TSM Extended Edition and IBM System Storage Archive Manager are affected on AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows and Mac OS

**Mitigation:**
-  Use the CAD scheduler or use the traditional scheduler in polling mode
-  Upgrade to patched versions 6.4.0.1, 6.3.1, and 6.2.5 (when available)
