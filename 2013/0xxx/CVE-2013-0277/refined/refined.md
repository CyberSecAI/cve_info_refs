Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0277:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Ruby on Rails versions 2.3 and 3.0 handle serialized attributes. Specifically, the `serialize` helper in Active Record uses YAML to serialize and deserialize objects stored in a database BLOB column. If user input is directly assigned to these serialized attributes, a specially crafted YAML payload could be used to cause the application to deserialize arbitrary YAML, potentially leading to denial of service or remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the deserialization of untrusted YAML data. Because YAML can encode objects including code, deserializing attacker-controlled YAML allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Direct Assignment to Serialized Attributes:**  The vulnerability is exploitable when developers allow direct user-controlled assignment of data to serialized attributes, such as through `params[:tags]` in the provided example.
*  **Bypass of attr\_protected**: Malformed input could circumvent the protection provided by `attr_protected`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could craft a YAML payload that causes the application to crash or become unresponsive due to excessive resource consumption during deserialization.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious YAML that constructs objects containing code, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This would allow the attacker to gain control of the server, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability via crafted HTTP requests. By manipulating the parameters in a POST or PUT request, an attacker can inject malicious YAML into the serialized attribute.
*  **Direct Parameter Injection:**  The vulnerability occurs when the application directly assigns user-provided parameters (e.g., from HTTP requests) to serialized model attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to submit HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code:**  The attacker needs to understand how the application uses serialized attributes to exploit it. This may require analysis of the application code or configuration.
*   **Craft Malicious YAML:**  The attacker requires the ability to create specially crafted YAML payloads that trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Ruby on Rails versions 2.3.x, 3.0.x, and all earlier versions.
*   It was fixed in version 2.3.17.
*   Rails 3.1.0 and later are not affected.
*   The recommended fix is to update to the patched version. A workaround is to use `attr_accessible` to prevent direct user input assignment to serialized attributes.
*  The issue was reported by Tobias Kraze.
