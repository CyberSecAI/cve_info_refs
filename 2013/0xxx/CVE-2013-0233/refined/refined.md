```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Devise gem for Ruby on Rails does not properly perform type conversion when processing database queries. This allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request with a manipulated `reset_password_token` to bypass security checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion vulnerability when performing database queries, allowing incorrect records to be returned."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can bypass security checks, potentially leading to unauthorized access, specifically demonstrated by resetting passwords of arbitrary accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted HTTP request is sent with modified parameters, particularly the `reset_password_token`, to exploit type conversion issues in database queries.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and know the email address associated with the account they wish to compromise. No prior account on the targeted system is required.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects Devise versions 2.2.x before 2.2.3, 2.1.x before 2.1.3, 2.0.x before 2.0.5, and 1.5.x before 1.5.4, when used with databases other than PostgreSQL or SQLite3. The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper type conversion when querying the database which can be exploited by sending XML to rails to influence the type used for the reset_password_token parameter. This vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the patches available."
