Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0713:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an issue in the way the VxWorks SSH server (IPSSH) processes pty requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation when handling pty requests. This allows an attacker to send a specially crafted packet that triggers the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- SSH access becomes unavailable until the next system reboot.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is network-based.
- The attacker needs to send a specifically crafted pty request packet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid username and password to log into the SSH server.
- The attacker can be remote (over the network).
