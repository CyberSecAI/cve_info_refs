{
  "CVE-2013-0433": {
    "Root cause": "The InetSocketAddress class did not properly implement serialization.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper serialization of InetSocketAddress class.",
      "Untrusted Java application or applet could deserialize invalid InetSockAddress data without throwing expected exceptions."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An untrusted Java application or applet could deserialize invalid InetSockAddress data without throwing expected exceptions.",
      "Attack vectors": [
         "Network - by sending malicious serialized data to a Java application/applet",
        "An untrusted Java application or applet"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable application to deserialize malicious InetSocketAddress data."
  }
