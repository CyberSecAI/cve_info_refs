  "CVE-2013-0242": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the regular expression matching routines that process multibyte character input. If an application utilized the glibc regular expression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted input that, when processed, would cause the application to crash.",

      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the glibc regular expression matching routines when processing multibyte characters.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Improper Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service due to application crash.",
      "attack_vector": "By providing specially crafted multibyte character input to an application using glibc's regular expression matching functions.",
