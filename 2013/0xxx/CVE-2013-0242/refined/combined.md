# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2013:0769 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Low: glibc security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0769)

## Topic

Updated glibc packages that fix two security issues and two bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server
Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without
these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

It was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory
used during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application
resolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause
the application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-1914)

A flaw was found in the regular expression matching routines that process
multibyte character input. If an application utilized the glibc regular
expression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted
input that, when processed, would cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2013-0242)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The improvements RHSA-2012:1207 made to the accuracy of floating point

functions in the math library caused performance regressions for those
functions. The performance regressions were analyzed and a fix was applied
that retains the current accuracy but reduces the performance penalty to
acceptable levels. Refer to Red Hat Knowledge solution 229993, linked
to in the References, for further information. (BZ#950535)

* It was possible that a memory location freed by the localization code

could be accessed immediately after, resulting in a crash. The fix ensures
that the application does not crash by avoiding the invalid memory access.
(BZ#951493)

Users of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=905874#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-30 11:15:10 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the regular expression matching routine of glibc, the GNU libc libraries, processed multibyte characters input. If an application utilized the glibc's regular expression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide a specially-crafted input that, when processed would lead to that executable crash.  Upstream bug report: [1] <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15078>  Relevant patch: [2] <http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2013-01/msg00967.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=905874#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-30 11:17:07 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the glibc package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the glibc package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16, 17, and 18. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=905874#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-30 11:18:17 UTC  ``` Created glibc tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 905877](show_bug.cgi?id=905877 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-0242 glibc: Buffer overrun (DoS) in regexp matcher by processing multibyte characters [f18]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=905874#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-30 11:43:16 UTC  ``` CVE request: [3] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/30/1>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=905874#c4)  Jeff Law    2013-01-30 14:17:18 UTC  ``` Jan,  Is there some reason trackers weren't created for this issue on RHEL as well?  Seems strange that we know this affects both Fedora & RHEL yet we're only tracking fixes for Fedora.  From your end, how serious does this appear -- I'm trying to figure out if we will need a 5.9-z or if it can just wait for 5.10.  Similarly are we going to need a 6.3-z, 6.4-z or can it wait for 6.5.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=905874#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-30 17:25:00 UTC  ``` Jeff, it looks like this is rated low-impact (crash-only, the buffer is overrun but not with anything the attacker can control), so we're likely to defer this until a more opportune time to fix (pushing a low-impact glibc update isn't something we like to do, as most people would reboot for a glibc update).  I suspect a statement to that effect will be written once a CVE is assigned.  That would also be why there are no RHEL trackers as of yet.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=905874#c6)  Carlos O'Donell    2013-01-30 18:37:42 UTC  ``` I'm reviewing Andreas' upstream patch.

Okay, so the regex implementation is still buggy until a newer glibc is released, but it no longer has a security vulnerability so this particular BZ can be deemed as fixed.  I guess the goal of minimal churn for plugging the CVE, instead of completely fixing the bug in the regex engine at the cost of more complicated backports, is acceptable from a risk-management standpoint.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=905874#c27)  Carlos O'Donell    2013-03-22 12:59:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #26](show_bug.cgi?id=905874#c26)) > (In reply to [comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=905874#c25)) > > Does that clarify the situation? >  > Okay, so the regex implementation is still buggy until a newer glibc is > released, but it no longer has a security vulnerability so this particular > BZ can be deemed as fixed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=947882#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-04-03 13:33:33 UTC  ``` A stack (frame) overflow flaw, leading to denial of service (application crash), was found in the way getaddrinfo() routine (returning a list of address structures for particular request) of glibc, the collection of GNU libc libraries, processed certain requests. If an application linked against glibc accepted untrusted getaddrinfo() input remotely, a remote attacker could issue a specially-crafted request, which once processed would lead to that application crash.

The application stack overflow results in a crash but requires poisoning DNS. We will wait for a more thorough upstream review and test before fixing this in all of Fedora.  Given the low priority we will fix this as required in RHEL.  If anyone has an objection to this plan of action please speak up with comments about why this should be higher than low priority and low severity.

If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=929388#c0)  Peter van Hoof    2013-03-30 10:58:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 718234](attachment.cgi?id=718234 "test case used for getting the timings") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=718234&action=edit "test case used for getting the timings") test case used for getting the timings  Description of problem: When upgrading from RHEL 6.3 to 6.4 we noticed that our code ran noticeably longer, sometimes up to a factor two longer. We could track this down to serious CPU time regressions in the glibc math library. We have investigated 5 routines in the math library: exp(), pow(), sin(), and cos() all showed CPU time regression to varying degrees, while expf() clearly is faster (though we rarely use that in our code). We have not investigated other math routines, but we suspect that many more routines will show CPU time regressions.  These are the timings (in seconds) we got for the attached program:           RHEL6.3 RHEL6.4 AMD exp():   12.17   47.03   9.38  Using a slightly modified version of the program we found:  pow():   28.94   63.57   24.05 [x += pow(x,-0.9)] sin():   158.91  192.35  14.43 [x += sin(x)] cos():   157.27  191.47  14.38 [x += cos(x)] expf():  93.92   10.58   8.35  [x += expf(-x)]  Though the speedup of the single-precision routine expf() is certainly welcome, it looks like it has been achieved at the expense of serious regressions in the double-precision routines (exp() almost by a factor 4, pow() more than a factor 2). Since the use of the double-precision variants will likely be dominant (it certainly is in our code) this needs to be fixed urgently. It is also obvious that the sin() and cos() functions (and likely other trigonometric functions) are embarrassingly slower than the AMD versions...  Going over the CPU times, I noticed that the absolute difference in run time for the double-precision test cases is nearly constant: exp(): +34.86 sec, pow(): +34.63 sec, sin(): +33.44 sec, cos(): +34.20 sec. This suggests that common code has been added to all double-precision routines that gobbles up a large amount of CPU time.  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: Compile the attached program with "g++ -O2 -ffast-math", then run with "time ./a.out". The timings were done using the glibc math libraries from RHEL 6.3 (glibc-2.12-1.80.el6_3.5.x86_64) and 6.4 (glibc-2.12-1.107.el6.x86_64), as well as the AMD math library v3.0.2 available here: <http://developer.amd.com/tools/cpu-development/libm/>  Timings were done on an otherwise empty system (with an Intel Xeon E5-2687W processor), and were repeated 3 times to check for accuracy. The median "user" run time is reported. Choosing the math library was done by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. The executable was not modified in the process.    Actual & Expected results: the timings are shown above. Ideally the glibc math library should be as fast as the AMD version or faster, but at least it should not be slower then the RHEL 6.3 version.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=929388#c1)  Siddhesh Poyarekar    2013-04-01 07:28:22 UTC  ``` Could you please try the packages here and see if they solve your problem:  <http://people.redhat.com/yoguma/.bz892635/>  Those are just for testing, so please don't deploy them on your production systems.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=929388#c2)  Peter van Hoof    2013-04-02 06:08:56 UTC  ``` With package glibc-2.12-1.107.el6.1.[bz892635](show_bug.cgi?id=892635).x86_64.rpm I get the following timings:  exp(): 13.73 pow(): 30.30 sin(): 158.70 cos(): 158.23 expf(): 10.60  So the CPU regression is largely solved in this version, though exp() and pow() are still somewhat slower than their RHEL6.3 counterparts.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=929388#c3)  Siddhesh Poyarekar    2013-04-02 06:18:58 UTC  ``` OK, thanks for confirming that.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=929388#c4)  Siddhesh Poyarekar    2013-04-02 06:21:51 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 892635](show_bug.cgi?id=892635) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=929388#c10)  Peter van Hoof    2013-05-08 09:53:13 UTC  ``` requested information was already supplied in [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=929388#c2).   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=929388#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-21 10:44:17 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# [PATCH] Fix buffer overrun in regexp matcher

* *From*: Andreas Schwab <schwab at suse dot de>
* *To*: libc-alpha at sourceware dot org
* *Date*: Tue, 29 Jan 2013 17:13:35 +0100
* *Subject*: [PATCH] Fix buffer overrun in regexp matcher

---

```
When extending regex buffers, make sure we allocate enough room for the
state log.  Merely doubling the space may not be enough if the current
node has accepted a long run of characters.  This part of the code only
triggers with multibyte characters.

Andreas.

	[BZ #15078]
	* posix/regexec.c (extend_buffers): Add parameter min_len.
	(check_matching): Pass minimum needed length.
	(clean_state_log_if_needed): Likewise.
	(get_subexp): Likewise.
	* posix/Makefile (tests): Add bug-regex34.
	(bug-regex34-ENV): Define.
	* posix/bug-regex34.c: New file.

## Synopsis

Moderate: glibc security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1605)

## Topic

Updated glibc packages that fix three security issues, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server
Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without
these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
were found in glibc's memory allocator functions (pvalloc, valloc, and
memalign). If an application used such a function, it could cause the
application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2013-4332)

A flaw was found in the regular expression matching routines that process
multibyte character input. If an application utilized the glibc regular
expression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted
input that, when processed, would cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2013-0242)

It was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory
used during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application
resolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause
the application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-1914)

Among other changes, this update includes an important fix for the following
bug:

* Due to a defect in the initial release of the getaddrinfo() system call in Red

Hat enterprise Linux 6.0, AF\_INET and AF\_INET6 queries resolved from the
/etc/hosts file returned queried names as canonical names. This incorrect
behavior is, however, still considered to be the expected behavior. As a result
of a recent change in getaddrinfo(), AF\_INET6 queries started resolving the
canonical names correctly. However, this behavior was unexpected by applications
that relied on queries resolved from the /etc/hosts file, and these applications
could thus fail to operate properly. This update applies a fix ensuring that
AF\_INET6 queries resolved from /etc/hosts always return the queried name as
canonical. Note that DNS lookups are resolved properly and always return the
correct canonical names. A proper fix to AF\_INET6 queries resolution from
/etc/hosts may be applied in future releases; for now, due to a lack of
standard, Red Hat suggests the first entry in the /etc/hosts file, that applies
for the IP address being resolved, to be considered the canonical entry.
(BZ#1022022)

These updated glibc packages also include additional bug fixes and
various enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes
in this advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5
Technical Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the
most significant of these changes.

All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
