Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0494:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way IBM Sterling B2B Integrator handles HTTP Range headers. Specifically, it is susceptible to HTTP Byte Range Denial of Service attacks. The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper input validation or resource management when processing byte range requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of HTTP Range headers leading to a denial of service vulnerability.
- Lack of input validation or resource management with byte range requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to exhaust server resources, making the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator service unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests containing malicious or excessive range header values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IBM Sterling B2B Integrator server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway.
- The fix involves applying specific fix packs or media updates.
- There are no identified workarounds or mitigations other than applying the fix.

The second document describes a separate vulnerability (CVE-2012-5936) related to missing secure flag in session cookies, and is thus **UNRELATED**.
