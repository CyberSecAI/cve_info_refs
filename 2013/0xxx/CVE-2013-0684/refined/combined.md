Mitigation

Invensys has developed an update to the WIS software that mitigates these vulnerabilities. The Positive Technologies Research Team has tested the update and validated that it fixes the vulnerabilities. Instructions to download and install the update are found on the Invensys download page at the following link:

<https://wdn.wonderware.com/sites/WDN/Pages/Downloads/Software.aspx>

According to Invensys, any machine running one or more of the products listed above is affected and should be patched. No other components of the WIS installed products are affected. Users should install the update using instructions provided in the ReadMe file for the product and component being installed. Invensys recommends that users should set the Security level settings in the Internet browser to “Medium – High” to minimize the risks presented by these vulnerabilities.

ICS‑CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies*.*CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last accessed May 07, 2013. ICS‑CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B—Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies,[Target Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last accessed May 07, 2013.](#_ftn15) that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page ([www.ics-cert.org](http://www.ics-cert.org/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS‑CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
