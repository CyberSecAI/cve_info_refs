Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0346:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the Tomcat 7 log directory and the log files within are world-readable due to insecure default permissions. Specifically, the log directory had permissions `drwxr-xr-x` and log files had permissions `-rw-r--r--`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- World-readable log directory and files. This allows any user on the system to read potentially sensitive information from the logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user can read Tomcat log files. This might include information that could be used to further compromise the system or application.
- Although Red Hat has stated that the logs do not usually contain sensitive information, they acknowledged cases where sensitive data has been written to logs, which is considered a separate vulnerability in Tomcat itself (e.g., CVE-2011-2204).

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access. Any user with access to the system can read the log files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system where Tomcat is running.

**Additional notes:**
- Red Hat considers this a low-severity issue as they state that Tomcat logs should not contain sensitive information.
- The Apache Tomcat project does not consider this a security flaw.
- The issue was reported on Gentoo, but the versions of the tomcat package shipped with Fedora 17 and 18 were not affected.
