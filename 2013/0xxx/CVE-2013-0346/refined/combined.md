| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=924841#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-22 15:41:03 UTC  ``` Agostino Sarubbo reported on the oss-security mailing list [1] that, on Gentoo, Tomcat 7's log directory is world-accessible and the log files inside the directory are world-readable.  This could allow an unprivileged user to read the log files.  References: [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/22/15> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/23/5>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=924841#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-03-22 15:42:54 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the tomcat package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17 and 18.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=924841#c3)  David Jorm    2013-09-02 00:36:52 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat does not regard this to be a security flaw. The tomcat log directory does not contain any sensitive information, and when sensitive information has been written to log files, this has been considered a security flaw in tomcat (e.g. [CVE-2011-2204](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2204)). This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat project, and they have not considered it a flaw in any published security advisories.   ``` |  |
