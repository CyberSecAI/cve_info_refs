- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The AirDroid web interface fails to sanitize malicious code within a text message on the target phone.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can conduct a cross-site scripting attack, which may lead to information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service on the host computer.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the phone being controlled by AirDroid sends a text message with malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the phone being controlled by AirDroid.
