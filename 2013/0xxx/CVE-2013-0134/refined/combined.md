## AirDroid web interface XSS vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#557252

Original Release Date: 2013-04-08 | Last Revised: 2013-09-03

---

### Overview

AirDroid web interface contains a XSS vulnerability.

### Description

| [CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html): Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')  The AirDroid web interface fails to sanitize malicious code within a text message on the target phone causing the script to be executed on the host computer. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with access to the phone being controlled by AirDroid can send a text message with malicious code. When this message is viewed on the AirDroid web interface an attacker can conduct a cross-site scripting attack, which may be used to result in information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service on the host computer. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**The vendor has stated that this vulnerability has been addressed in the latest version of AirDroid. Users are advised to upgrade to the latest version of AirDroid on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sand.airdroid). |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS, CSRF, or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the AirDroid web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
