{
  "CVE-2013-0249": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in libcurl's POP3 and SMTP protocol handlers during SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication. The function `Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message()` appends server-provided data to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper length checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Fixed-size buffer on the stack"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted response during the authentication process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation",
        "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the server side of a POP3 or SMTP connection, or be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to manipulate the server response during SASL authentication."
