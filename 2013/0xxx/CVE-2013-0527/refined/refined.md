Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0527:

**Summary:**

The provided documents indicate that CVE-2013-0527 is related to information disclosure vulnerabilities in the IBM Sterling Connect:Direct Browser user interface. The vulnerability allows for the potential exposure of user data due to browser pages not refreshing after an idle session timeout.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the failure of the IBM Sterling Connect:Direct Browser to properly invalidate or refresh open application pages after an idle session timeout.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper session management, specifically regarding the handling of idle session timeouts and the subsequent state of the browser interface. Open pages remain active after session expiration.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive user data by accessing the browser if a user leaves an application page open and idle.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a user leaving an active session open in a browser and the session subsequently timing out. An attacker could then access the exposed information by using the still-open page.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker requires physical access to a machine where a user has left an active browser session open.
* **Versions Affected**: IBM Sterling Connect:Direct Browser versions 1.4 and 1.5 are vulnerable. The fix is related to APAR IC90479, resolved in June 2013.

**Additional Notes:**
* The fix involves a session timeout warning with user logout to clear user data, as indicated by APAR IC90479, which is explicitly linked to this vulnerability.
* There are multiple platform affected: AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, z/OS.
