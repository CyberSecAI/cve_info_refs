Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0714:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the SSH server (IPSSH) implementation in VxWorks when processing public key authentication requests. Specifically, a specially crafted packet can trigger the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) in handling public key authentication requests within the SSH server. This allows an attacker to send a crafted packet that the server fails to process correctly.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The server hangs, and SSH access becomes unavailable until the next reboot.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In addition to the DoS, the vulnerability may allow arbitrary code execution on the server with administrator privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

- Network-based attack vector via the SSH protocol.
- The attacker sends a specially crafted public key authentication request packet to the vulnerable SSH server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker does not need any prior authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely. They can be unauthenticated when initiating the attack.
- They need to be able to send network packets to the target system's SSH server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects VxWorks versions 6.5 through 6.9.
- A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 is assigned, indicating critical severity.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Hisashi Kojima and Masahiro Nakada of Fujitsu Laboratories.
