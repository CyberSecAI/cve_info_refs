  "CVE-2013-0155": {
    "description": "Multiple input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in rubygem-activerecord. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to perform an SQL injection attack against an application using rubygem-activerecord.",
    "technical_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "An interpretation conflict in Active Record's query processing, specifically when used with JSON parameter parsing, can lead to unexpected query truncation or modification.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Unsafe query generation leading to potential SQL injection.",
          "The ability to inject NULL values into SQL queries.",
            "The ability to eliminate the WHERE clause in SQL queries under certain conditions."
        ],
         "impact": "An attacker could manipulate SQL queries to bypass authentication systems, potentially leading to unauthorized access, or modify data.",
          "attack_vectors": [
          "Crafted HTTP requests with malicious JSON parameters.",
              "By exploiting how Active Record processes parameters from the JSON request bodies, attackers can insert 'IS NULL' conditions into SQL queries, or remove entire WHERE clauses."
           ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server."
      },
    {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs when Active Record interprets parameters in combination with JSON parameter parsing. Specifically, the system can be tricked into accepting an array containing `nil` or an empty hash as input.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Unsafe query generation via `find_by_*` dynamic finders and relations.",
          "Input validation bypass via nil array or empty hash."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can cause the application to execute unexpected database queries that could lead to information disclosure, data modification, or authentication bypass.",
           "attack_vectors": [
              "Craft a request with a parameter (e.g., `params[:token]`) that returns `[nil]` which bypasses a `nil?` check but adds an `IN ('xyz', NULL)` clause to the SQL query.",
             "Craft a request with a parameter (e.g., `params[:token]`) that returns an empty hash, which bypasses a `nil?` check but eliminates the `WHERE` clause in the SQL query."
            ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."

    "affected_components": [
      "rubygem-actionpack",
      "rubygem-activerecord"

    "suggested_remediation": "Upgrade to the patched versions or use the provided workaround by casting the parameter to a string before passing it to Active Record. For example: `user = User.find_by_token(params[:token].to_s)`"
