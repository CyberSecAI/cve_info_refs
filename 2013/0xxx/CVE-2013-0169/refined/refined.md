**Key takeaways:**

*   **Vulnerability:** The "Lucky Thirteen" issue, a timing side-channel attack on MAC checks during the processing of malformed CBC padding in TLS/DTLS protocols. It allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets.
*   **Root Cause:** Improper consideration of timing side-channel attacks during MAC check in malformed CBC padding.
*   **Affected components:** TLS protocol 1.1 and 1.2 and the DTLS protocol 1.0 and 1.2. OpenSSL, OpenJDK, PolarSSL, and other products are affected.
*   **Impact:** Plaintext recovery or distinguishing attacks potentially leading to full compromise of encrypted data. In some configurations DoS
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation of timing discrepancies during the MAC check of malformed CBC padding in TLS/DTLS to recover plaintext. Remote exploitation is possible, and in some instances, can be achieved in a single DTLS session.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to inject crafted packets and measure timing data. For TLS, multiple sessions are required and attacker must be located close to the machine.
*   **Severity:** SUSE rates this as low severity. Red Hat, Splunk, and others rate this as moderate severity.
*   **Mitigation:** Disabling TLS compression, prioritizing CBC ciphersuites, or applying specific patches that address the timing discrepancies.
*  **Fixed Versions:** OpenSSL 1.0.1d, 1.0.0k, 0.9.8y, PolarSSL 1.2.5, IcedTea6 1.11.8, IcedTea6 1.12.3, IcedTea7 2.1.6, IcedTea7 2.2.6, IcedTea7 2.3.7
