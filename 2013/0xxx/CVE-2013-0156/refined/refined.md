{
  "CVE-2013-0156": {
    "Description": "The Ruby on Rails web application framework performed insufficient validation on input parameters, allowing unintended type conversions. An attacker may use this to bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and execute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on the application.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to Rails handling of formatted parameters, specifically XML, allowing type conversions that should not be allowed from user-provided data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Unintended type conversions",
       "Improper handling of XML parameters"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can achieve the following:\n        - Bypass authentication systems.\n        - Inject arbitrary SQL.\n        - Inject and execute arbitrary code.\n        - Perform a DoS attack.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a malicious POST request with a Content-Type header set to \"application/xml\" containing specially crafted XML data.",
      "Exploiting the ability to specify POST parameters in XML format",
      "Injecting malicious YAML or Symbol types via XML parameters"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Rails application",
      "Knowledge of XML structures and how to embed malicious content like YAML and symbols."
       "Ability to access the application over the network"
    ],
        "Additional Details": [
            "The vulnerability stems from the Rails XML parameter parser allowing the deserialization of XML trees into different data types, including 'symbol' and 'yaml'.",
            "The 'symbol' type allows for the injection of symbols with malicious values. While 'with_indifferent_access' transforms symbol keys to strings, exploitation is still potentially feasible",
             "The 'yaml' type can deserialize arbitrary data types, including Symbols and objects, allowing an attacker to create instances of any class defined in the application and set instance variables to arbitrary values.",
            "This can lead to object injection attacks similar to PHP's unserialize() vulnerabilities.",
             "By creating arel (Active Record) objects through YAML, SQL injection is possible due to a lack of escaping when Arel objects are used in dynamic finder methods.",
            "A workaround involves disabling XML parameter parsing or removing YAML and Symbol type conversions from the Rails XML parser."
         ]
