| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 23:19:11 UTC  ``` Hi!  I gotten use to CONFIG_PROTECT not allowing changes to existing config files in /etc, so it bothers me when an ebuild does this.  Using pkg_postinst to change /etc/profile is cheating :)  options that I can think of:  1. Just echo the info to the screen in pkg_postinst telling the user to modify /etc/profile, or their .bashrc  2.  Include a modified profile.colorgcc file in the colorgcc/files directory and then insinto /etc newins ${FILESDIR}/profile.colorgcc profile  CONFIG_PROTECT will catch this and create a ._cfg0000_profile in /etc  I like color!  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-20 01:31:39 UTC  ``` fixed on cvs.  Thanks for your patience :) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-21 09:13:25 UTC  ``` It looks like -r1 wasn't committed. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-21 14:16:10 UTC  ``` committed now ``` |  |

Message-ID: <20130220081904.GA27144@ugly.local>
Date: Wed, 20 Feb 2013 09:19:04 +0100
From: Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@....org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: isync/mbsync security advisory: missing SSL subject verification
 (CVE-2013-0289)

Christian Schneider <software [at] chschneider [dot] eu> discovered that
isync does no SSL subject (hostname) verification.

This means that any host with a valid certificate could pretend to be
the wanted host, as long as the certificate store contained the relevant
root certificate. This could be used for man-in-the-middle attacks, which
could be used to steal passwords.

Workaround: Specify a CertificateFile which contains only the wanted
host's certificate, thus disabling trust chain based verification. Early
versions of isync's SSL support tried to enforce this mode of operation.

Isync releases 0.4 up to including 1.0.5 are affected. Version 1.0.6 has
been just released to address the issue.

Patch: <http://isync.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=isync/isync;a=patch;h=914ede18664980925628a9ed2a73ad05f85aeedb>
