# USN-1981-1: HPLIP vulnerabilities

30 September 2013

HPLIP could be made to overwrite files.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [hplip](/security/cves?package=hplip) - HP Linux Printing and Imaging System (HPLIP)

## Details

It was discovered that HPLIP incorrectly handled temporary files when using

the fax capabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

overwrite arbitrary files. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2011-2722](/security/CVE-2011-2722))

Tim Waugh discovered that HPLIP incorrectly handled temporary files when

printing. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite

arbitrary files. In the default installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu

12.10, this should be prevented by the Yama link restrictions.

([CVE-2013-0200](/security/CVE-2013-0200))

## Synopsis

Low: hplip security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0500)

## Topic

Updated hplip packages that fix several security issues, multiple bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The hplip packages contain the Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing
Project (HPLIP), which provides drivers for Hewlett-Packard printers and
multi-function peripherals.

Several temporary file handling flaws were found in HPLIP. A local attacker
could use these flaws to perform a symbolic link attack, overwriting
arbitrary files accessible to a process using HPLIP. (CVE-2013-0200,
CVE-2011-2722)

The CVE-2013-0200 issues were discovered by Tim Waugh of Red Hat.

The hplip packages have been upgraded to upstream version 3.12.4, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
(BZ#731900)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, the hpijs package required the obsolete cupsddk-drivers

package, which was provided by the cups package. Under certain
circumstances, this dependency caused hpijs installation to fail. This
bug has been fixed and hpijs no longer requires cupsddk-drivers.
(BZ#829453)

* The configuration of the Scanner Access Now Easy (SANE) back end is

located in the /etc/sane.d/dll.d/ directory, however, the hp-check
utility checked only the /etc/sane.d/dll.conf file. Consequently,
hp-check checked for correct installation, but incorrectly reported a
problem with the way the SANE back end was installed. With this update,
hp-check properly checks for installation problems in both locations as
expected. (BZ#683007)

All users of hplip are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
fix these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=902163#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-01-21 04:05:16 UTC  ``` Temporary file handling flaws were found in several places in hplip. Because a predicatable temporary filenames are used, an attacker could use a symlink attack to overwrite an arbitrary file with the privileges of the process running hplip.  This is a different flaw than [CVE-2011-2722](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2722).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=902163#c2)  Huzaifa S.
