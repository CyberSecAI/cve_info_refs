  "CVE-2013-0200": {
    "Description": "Several temporary file handling flaws were found in HPLIP. A local attacker could use these flaws to perform a symbolic link attack, overwriting arbitrary files accessible to a process using HPLIP.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure handling of temporary files, using predictable filenames which allows for symlink attacks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file handling",
      "Predictable temporary filenames"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files accessible to a process using HPLIP.",
    "Attack vectors": "Symbolic link attack",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker"
