Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-0095:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Entourage for Mac and Microsoft Outlook for Mac handle specific content tags within HTML5 email messages. Specifically, these applications were loading content from external sources without requiring user consent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unintended Content Loading: The primary weakness is the applications' failure to prevent the automatic loading of external content when rendering HTML emails. This bypasses the user's expectation of privacy and security.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can use this vulnerability to confirm if a targeted email address is valid and if the crafted email has been read. This is achieved by having the email client load a resource from a server controlled by the attacker. The server logs the request confirming that the email was opened.
- Potential for further attacks: Although not explicitly mentioned in the document, the ability to load external content without user consent can be used as a basis for more complex attacks by redirecting the user to a malicious URL or loading malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email: The attack vector is a specially crafted HTML email message containing HTML5 content tags that trigger the unintended content loading.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send emails to the targeted user(s).
- Ability to create and control a remote server to host the content to be loaded.
- Technical knowledge to craft a malicious email with HTML5 tags.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac and Microsoft Office for Mac 2011.
- The vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly known at the time of the security bulletin release.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the user previews or opens the crafted email message.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that Microsoft Outlook for Mac and Microsoft Entourage for Mac do not download content from external sources without user consent.
- The issue is related to the use of WebKit, the layout engine used by the affected applications.
