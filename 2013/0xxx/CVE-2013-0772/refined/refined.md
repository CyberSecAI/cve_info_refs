{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds read while rendering GIF images.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `mozilla::image::RasterImage::DrawFrameTo` function while rendering GIF format images. This can cause a crash and might expose inaccessible data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation can lead to a denial of service via application crash. It could also potentially expose normally inaccessible data as part of the image rendering.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted GIF image that, when rendered by Firefox or SeaMonkey, triggers the out-of-bounds read.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted web page containing the malicious GIF image. This does not require any special privileges or local access to the system."
