Alert
# Oracle Java Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedOctober 19, 2016
Alert CodeTA13-032A

### Systems Affected

Any system using Oracle Java including

* JDK and JRE 7 Update 11 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 6 Update 38 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 38 and earlier
* SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_40 and earlier
* JavaFX 2.2.4 and earlier
* Java 1.6.0\_37 and earlier for Mac OS X and OS X Server 10.6.8

Web browsers using the Java plug-in are at high risk.

### Overview

Multiple vulnerabilities in Java could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

The Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory for [February 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Both Java applets delivered via web browsers and stand-alone Java applications are affected, however web browsers using the Java plug-in are at particularly high risk.

The Java plug-in, the Java Deployment Toolkit plug-in, and Java Web Start can be used as attack vectors. An attacker could use social engineering techniques to entice a user to visit a link to a website hosting a malicious Java applet. An attacker could also compromise a legitimate web site and upload a malicious Java applet (a "drive-by download" attack).

Some vulnerabilities affect stand-alone Java applications, depending on how the Java application functions and how it processes untrusted data.

Reports indicate that at least one of these vulnerabilities is being actively exploited.

Further technical details are available in Vulnerability Note [VU#858729](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/858729).

### Impact

By convincing a user to load a malicious Java applet or Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the Java plug-in process.

Stand-alone java applications may also be affected.

### Solution

**Update Java**

The Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory for [February 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) states that Java 7 Update 13 and Java 6 Update 39 address these vulnerabilities.

**Disable Java in web browsers**

These and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered. To defend against this and future Java vulnerabilities, consider disabling Java in web browsers until adequate updates have been installed. As with any software, unnecessary features should be disabled or removed as appropriate for your environment.

Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to disable Java content in web browsers through the Java control panel applet. From [Setting the Security Level of the Java Client](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable):

For installations where the highest level of security is required, it is possible to entirely prevent *any* Java apps (signed or unsigned) from running in a browser by de-selecting Enable Java content in the browser in the Java Control Panel under the Security tab.

If you are unable to update to Java 7 Update 13 please see the solution section of Vulnerability Note [VU#636312](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312#solution) for instructions on how to disable Java on a per-browser basis.

**Restrict access to Java applets**

Network administrators unable to disable Java in web browsers may be able to help mitigate these and other Java vulnerabilities by restricting access to Java applets [using a web proxy](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2012/11/do-devs-care-about-java-insecurity.html?showComment=1353874245992#c4794680666510382012). Most web proxies have features that can be used to block or whitelist requests for `.jar` and `.class` files based on network location. Filtering requests that contain a Java User-Agent header may also be effective. For environments where Java is required on the local intranet, the proxy can be configured to allow access to Java applets hosted locally, but block access to Java applets on the internet.

## Oracle Java contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#858729

Original Release Date: 2013-02-01 | Last Revised: 2013-06-14

---

### Overview

Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier versions of Java contain vulnerabilities that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows users to run Java applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Oracle has made the JRE available for multiple operating systems.  The Java JRE plug-in provides its own [Security Manager](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29). Typically, a web applet runs with a security manager provided by the browser or Java Web Start plugin. Oracle's document [states](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29), *"If there is a security manager already installed, this method first calls the security manager's* *checkPermission* *method with a* *RuntimePermission("setSecurityManager")* *permission to ensure it's safe to replace the existing security manager. This may result in throwing a* *SecurityException"**.* By leveraging a number of vulnerabilities, an untrusted Java applet can escalate its privileges to allow full privileges, without requiring code signing. Other vulnerabilities can cause exploitable memory corruption, which could affect Java applets, as well as Java applications, depending on what the Java application does and how it may process untrusted data. Oracle Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier Java versions are affected.At least one of these vulnerabilities is reportedly being exploited in the wild. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Note that applications that use the Internet Explorer web content rendering components, such as Microsoft Office or Windows Desktop Search, may also be used as an attack vector for these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities that affect server deployments of Java may be exploited by causing a Java server application to process untrusted data. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These issues are addressed in Java 7 Update 13 and Java 6 Update 39. Please see the [Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) - February 2013 for more details. |
| --- |

| **Disable Java in web browsers**Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to [disable Java content in web browsers](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml) through the Java control panel applet. Please see the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable) for more details.System administrators wishing to deploy Java 7 Update 10 or later with the "Enable Java content in the browser" feature disabled can invoke the Java installer with the WEB\_JAVA=0 command-line option. More details are available in the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#install).Alternatively, Microsoft has released a [Fix it](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/05/29/java-when-you-cannot-let-go.aspx) that disables Java in the Internet Explorer web browser.**Restrict access to Java applets**Network administrators unable to disable Java in web browsers may be able to help mitigate this and other Java vulnerabilities by restricting access to Java applets. This may be accomplished by using proxy server rules, for example. Blocking or whitelisting web requests to .jar and .class files can help to prevent Java from being used by untrusted sources. Filtering requests that contain a Java User-Agent header may also be effective. For example, this technique can be used in environments where Java is required on the local intranet. The proxy can be configured to allow Java requests locally, but block them when the destination is a site on the internet. |

# Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - February 2013

## Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - February 2013

**Note:** *The original Critical Patch Update for Java SE – February 2013 was scheduled to be released on February 19th, but Oracle decided to accelerate the release of this Critical Patch Update because active exploitation “in the wild” of one of the vulnerabilities affecting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in desktop browsers, was addressed with this Critical Patch Update.*

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update and Security Alert. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update and Security Alert advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

 **Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 50 new security fixes across Java SE products.

### Supported Products Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PatchTable) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Affected product releases and versions:

| Java SE | Patch Availability |
| --- | --- |
| JDK and JRE 7 Update 11 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |

#### Risk Matrix Content

The risk matrix lists only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for [previous](/security-alerts/) security fixes can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Document, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply these fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Security advisories, please review [previous](/security-alerts/) advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer supported. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 50 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  49 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/javacpufeb2013verbose.html).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

For issues in Deployment, fixes are only made available for JDK and JRE 7 and 6. Users should use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start in the latest JDK and JRE 7 or 6 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

#### Notes:

1. Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using untrusted Java Web Start applications or untrusted Java applets, such as through a web service.
2. Applies to client deployment of Java only. This vulnerability can be exploited only through untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets. (Untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted applets run in the Java sandbox with limited privileges.)
3. Applies to installation process on client deployment of Java.
4. Applies to server deployments of JSSE.
5. This issue (CVE-2013-1489) has been discussed publicly and is sometimes known as the "Java Security Slider vulnerability". It has a CVSS of 0 because it does not directly result in an exploitation, but may be combined with other vulnerabilities to allow blind exploitation. When the Security Slider is set to the default (high) all unsigned applets must be authorized via a dialog box by a browser user in order to execute. This provides the browser operator the opportunity to prevent execution of suspicious applets that may result in successful exploits. However, when CVE-2013-1489 is combined with vulnerabilities that can be used to cause direct impacts, the effect can be that the impact can be caused "silently" without the authorization dialog box.
