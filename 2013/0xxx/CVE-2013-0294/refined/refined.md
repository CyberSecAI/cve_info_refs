  "CVE-2013-0294": {
    "related_content": true,
    "root_cause": "The python-pyrad library used Python's `random` module to generate pseudo-random data for securing passwords, which is not cryptographically secure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a weak pseudo-random number generator for security-sensitive operations."
    ],
    "impact": "Predictable password hashing, potentially leading to password compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially predict the generated random data used in password hashing, potentially leading to password disclosure or authentication bypass.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need knowledge of the implementation and the ability to intercept or observe the relevant network traffic, as well as potentially analyze the generated values."
