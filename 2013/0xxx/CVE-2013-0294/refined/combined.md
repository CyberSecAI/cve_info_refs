| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-15 15:59:42 UTC  ``` Nathaniel McCallum reported that pyrad was using Python's random module in a number of places to generate pseudo-random data.  In the case of the authenticator data, it was being used to secure a password sent over the wire.  Because Python's random module is not really suited for this purpose (not random enough), it could lead to password hashing that may be predictable.  This has been corrected in upstream's forthcoming version 2.1 via:  <https://github.com/wichert/pyrad/commit/38f74b36814ca5b1a27d9898141126af4953bee5>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-15 16:01:22 UTC  ``` Created python-pyrad tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 894487](show_bug.cgi?id=894487 "CLOSED ERRATA - python-pyrad: potentially predictable password hashing [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 911683](show_bug.cgi?id=911683 "CLOSED ERRATA - python-pyrad: potentially predictable password hashing [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-20 17:11:39 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 911685](show_bug.cgi?id=911685 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2013-0342 python-pyrad: CreateID() creates serialized packet IDs for RADIUS") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-20 17:14:32 UTC  ``` Merging the other issue from [bug 911685](show_bug.cgi?id=911685 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2013-0342 python-pyrad: CreateID() creates serialized packet IDs for RADIUS"):  Nathaniel McCallum reported that pyrad was creating serialized RADIUS packet IDs in the CreateID() function in packet.py.  This is not suitable for RADIUS as the RFC specifies that the ID must not be predictable.  As a result, the ID of the next packet sent can be spoofed.  This has been corrected in upstream's forthcoming version 2.1 via:  <https://github.com/wichert/pyrad/commit/38f74b36814ca5b1a27d9898141126af4953bee5>   Due to the same patch being used to fix essentially the same thing, which was introduced at the same time, as per MITRE's direction:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/15/15>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c4)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-22 17:09:02 UTC  ``` This is not the same issue as [bug 911685](show_bug.cgi?id=911685 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2013-0342 python-pyrad: CreateID() creates serialized packet IDs for RADIUS") which was assigned [CVE-2013-0342](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0342), so this is one singular issue unrelated to the other.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c5)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-15 00:49:52 UTC  ``` python-pyrad-2.0-3.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c6)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-15 00:57:10 UTC  ``` python-pyrad-2.0-3.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c7)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-20 19:58:33 UTC  ``` python-pyrad-1.1-3.el5 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 5 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c8)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-20 19:58:53 UTC  ``` python-pyrad-2.0-3.el6 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 6 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c9)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-23 00:40:29 UTC  ``` python-pyrad-2.0-3.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=911682#c10)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-10 11:00:04 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=911685#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-15 16:12:02 UTC  ``` Nathaniel McCallum reported that pyrad was creating serialized RADIUS packet IDs in the CreateID() function in packet.py.  This is not suitable for RADIUS as the RFC specifies that the ID must not be predictable.  As a result, the ID of the next packet sent can be spoofed.  This has been corrected in upstream's forthcoming version 2.1 via:  <https://github.com/wichert/pyrad/commit/38f74b36814ca5b1a27d9898141126af4953bee5>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=911685#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-15 16:13:20 UTC  ``` Created python-pyrad tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 894488](show_bug.cgi?id=894488 "CLOSED WONTFIX - python-pyrad: CreateID() uses an incrementing ID rather than a random one for RADIUS packet IDs [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 911687](show_bug.cgi?id=911687 "CLOSED EOL - python-pyrad: CreateID() creates serialized packet IDs for RADIUS [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=911685#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-20 17:11:38 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 911682](show_bug.cgi?id=911682 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2013-0294 python-pyrad: poor randomness leads to predictable password hashing and RADIUS IDs") ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=911685#c3)  Nathaniel McCallum    2013-02-20 22:56:31 UTC  ``` The above patch does not apply to this issue as this issue is NOT a duplicate of [bug 911682](show_bug.cgi?id=911682 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2013-0294 python-pyrad: poor randomness leads to predictable password hashing and RADIUS IDs").   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=911685#c4)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-20 23:04:31 UTC  ``` Why is that?  If I look at the patch, I see the change to CreateID() on line 226/229 from using random.randrange() to random_generator.randrange().  Is that not the fix for this issue?  That is the only upstream patch applied in the last year and a half.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=911685#c5)  Nathaniel McCallum    2013-02-21 15:34:10 UTC  ``` See: <https://github.com/wichert/pyrad/blob/38f74b36814ca5b1a27d9898141126af4953bee5/pyrad/packet.py#L518>  There are two CreateID() codepaths. One generates a random ID and the other generates a sequential ID. Neither checks for uniqueness.  To be fair, this predictability is only exploitable in the presence of another security problem. So the issue is minor and it would require a major upstream API rework. I don't know if upstream will accept any patch to fix this or even consider this a bug. [Bug 911682](show_bug.cgi?id=911682 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2013-0294 python-pyrad: poor randomness leads to predictable password hashing and RADIUS IDs") is far more serious.  I'm not sure how the CVE for this bug should be handled.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=911685#c6)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-21 23:13:16 UTC  ``` Ok, I see it now.  Your initial report wasn't clear enough (pointing to actual code snippets instead of function names (when there are two identical) would have helped.  This is a bit messy now.  We did have two CVEs assigned, and MITRE rejected one based on their assumption (and my own) of that patch correcting both flaws.  I'll have to see if we can use the old one or if we need a new one again.  I've requested it on oss-sec now: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/21/27>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=911685#c7)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-22 17:05:57 UTC  ``` [CVE-2013-0342](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0342) was assigned to this issue:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/22/2>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=911685#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-10 11:00:06 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products.   ``` |  |

Please use CVE-2013-0294 for this issue.
