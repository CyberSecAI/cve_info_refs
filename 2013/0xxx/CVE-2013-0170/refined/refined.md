  "CVE-2013-0170": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CNA": "Red Hat",
      "Description": "A flaw was found in the way message freeing on connection cleanup was handled under certain error conditions. A remote user able to issue commands to libvirt daemon could use this flaw to crash libvirtd or, potentially, escalate their privilages to that of libvirtd process.",
      "ID": "CVE-2013-0170",
        "Patches": [
            "RHSA-2013:0199"
        ]
      
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `virNetMessageFree()` function of the libvirt library when handling connection cleanup under specific error conditions.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could potentially crash the libvirtd daemon or escalate privileges to that of the libvirtd process.",
      "Attack vector": "A remote attacker able to issue commands to the libvirt daemon",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to establish a connection, with at least read-only privileges, to the libvirtd daemon. The attacker needs to trigger specific error conditions in connection cleanup to exploit the use-after-free vulnerability."
