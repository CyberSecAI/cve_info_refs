Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0129:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper neutralization of user-supplied input during web page generation, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability exists in the "Create new directory" text field under "WebFTP" -> "Overview," where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be reflected in the error page.
- **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability is also present in the e-mail autoresponder body, where an attacker can store malicious JavaScript code. This code will execute every time someone tries to change the autoresponder text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerabilities can lead to:
- Information leakage
- Privilege escalation
- Denial of service on the host computer
- Stealing of session cookies, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user (especially if targeting support contacts with higher privileges).

**Attack Vectors:**
- For the reflected XSS, the attacker needs to paste the malicious string into the "Create new directory" text field.
- For the stored XSS, the attacker needs to set the malicious string as the body of an email autoresponder.
-  In both cases the attacker depends on the user's browser to execute the attacker supplied code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the pd-admin web interface.
- For reflected XSS, the attacker needs to induce a victim to visit the page with the injected code in the query parameters.
- For stored XSS, the attacker needs to have the ability to modify autoresponder settings.

**Additional Notes**
- The vendor released pd-admin 4.17 to address these vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability was reported by Thomas Roth.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-79 "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"

The provided content aligns with the CVE description, offering details about the specific vulnerable locations and providing examples of how the XSS attacks can be triggered.
