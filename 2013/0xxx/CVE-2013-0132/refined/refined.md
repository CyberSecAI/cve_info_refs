Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-0132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within Plesk's custom version of `suexec`, a program that executes other programs with different user permissions.
- Plesk's `suexec` binary allows the execution of 'cgi-wrapper', bypassing ownership restrictions.
- `cgi-wrapper` executes a PHP script based on environment variables, and `suexec` does not sanitize these variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure `suexec` Implementation:** Plesk's `suexec` allows execution of arbitrary code via 'cgi-wrapper'.
- **Lack of Environment Variable Sanitization:** `suexec` does not sanitize the environment variables passed to `cgi-wrapper`, allowing malicious manipulation.
- **Bypass of Ownership Restrictions:** The custom version of suexec does not check ownership of files to be called.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary PHP code can be executed with a user ID above a certain minimum value, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- An attacker could potentially gain root access by exploiting this vulnerability in combination with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can leverage the `suexec` binary to execute arbitrary PHP code by manipulating environment variables via the `cgi-wrapper` executable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to execute code on the server where Plesk is installed. This usually implies the attacker already has an account on the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate environment variables that are passed to the `cgi-wrapper` executable when it's called through suexec.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is specific to Plesk Panel 11.0.9 and potentially earlier versions.
- The document also mentions CVE-2013-0133, which is a separate privilege escalation vulnerability related to the `/usr/local/psa/admin/sbin/wrapper` program and PATH environment variable manipulation. This is outside the scope of CVE-2013-0132
- The document provides a workaround and solution: to disable mod\_php, mod\_python, and mod\_perl, switching to FastCGI and CGI, and also to update to the latest security releases.
