Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-0029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error within the CHTML object in Internet Explorer. This occurs when the browser attempts to access a memory location that has already been freed, due to a flaw in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: The CHTML object is accessed after it has been freed, leading to potential memory corruption.
- Memory corruption: The use-after-free condition can corrupt memory, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite data or execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the current user.
- Complete system control: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to trigger the use-after-free condition when viewed with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- Compromised websites: Attackers could inject malicious code into legitimate websites or advertisements hosted on them to exploit the vulnerability.
- Phishing: Attackers may use emails with malicious links or attachments to lure users to attacker-controlled content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by convincing a user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file containing crafted HTML.
- Unauthenticated: No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker simply needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious page.
- Ability to craft malicious content: The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted webpage or HTML content to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability.

**Affected Software:**
- Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8 and 9 on Windows XP, Vista, Server 2003, Server 2008, and Windows 7.
- Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 8, Windows RT, and Windows Server 2012

**Mitigations:**
- Enabling Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers.
- Setting Internet Explorer security settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting.
- Configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable it.
- Keeping software updated with the latest patches.

**Note:** This vulnerability is part of a larger set of use-after-free vulnerabilities fixed by Microsoft in the same update.
