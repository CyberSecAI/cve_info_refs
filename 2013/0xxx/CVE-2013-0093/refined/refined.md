Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-0093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a "use-after-free" error. This occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access an object in memory that has already been deleted or freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that the browser is trying to use a memory location that is no longer valid. Specifically, this vulnerability is triggered in the context of the `onBeforeCopy` event.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative privileges, an attacker could gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new user accounts with full user rights.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability involves memory corruption, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or system crashes, besides the possibility of arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a specially crafted webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability. If a user visits this page using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or those that accept user-generated content or advertisements.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to convince users to visit the malicious website, typically through phishing emails or instant messages with malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any specific credentials or access to the targeted system before exploitation.
*   **Ability to host web content or inject code:** The attacker needs a platform to host their malicious content or inject it into an existing one.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the user to visit the malicious website or open a crafted file that loads the malicious HTML content into Internet Explorer.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" for client operating systems, and "Moderate" for server operating systems due to Enhanced Security Configuration by default on servers, which makes exploitation more difficult.
*   Mitigations such as disabling Active Scripting, setting security levels to "High", or using EMET can reduce the risk of exploitation.
