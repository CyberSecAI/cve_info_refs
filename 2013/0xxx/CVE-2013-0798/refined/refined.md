Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-0798:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `app_tmp` directory in Firefox for Android was created with world-readable and writable permissions (777).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The overly permissive permissions on the `app_tmp` directory allowed any application on the device to read and write to it.
*   **Add-on Tampering:** This weakness could be exploited to replace or alter Firefox add-ons during the download and installation process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Add-on Installation:** An attacker could replace a legitimate add-on with a malicious one, potentially gaining access to sensitive user data within the browser.
*   **Bypass of Android Sandboxing:** This vulnerability allowed an application with only file system access to gain full Firefox permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Android Application:** An attacker would need to trick the user into installing a malicious Android application that could then monitor and modify the contents of the Firefox `app_tmp` directory.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Although not explicitly mentioned, a sophisticated attacker might use this as a second-stage exploit by first gaining access to the network traffic, and then modifying the downloaded files in the app_tmp folder.
* **Local File System Access:** The malicious application requires local file system access to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Installation on the Device:** The attacker needs to convince the user to install a malicious application on their Android device.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** The attacker's app would need to use `FileObserver` (Android class to notify applications of file/directory content changes) to detect when Firefox downloads an add-on.
* **Overwrite Permissions:** Ability to overwrite files in the vulnerable folder, `app_tmp`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Firefox for Android versions prior to version 20.
*   The fix involves creating a new `app_tmp` directory with user-read-write-only permissions (700), and removing the old, world-writable directory to prevent tampering.
*   The vulnerability was considered a "sec-moderate" issue because it required the user to install a malicious application, but was also considered "sec-high" in its potential impact by bypassing the Android sandbox and allowing malicious add-ons to be installed.

This vulnerability has been fixed by changing the permissions of the `app_tmp` directory and also moving the memory dumps to the downloads directory.
