  "CVE-2013-0776": {
    "Description": "The browser displayed the content of a proxy's 407 response if a user canceled the proxy's authentication prompt. In this circumstance, the address bar will continue to show the requested site's address, including HTTPS addresses that appear to be secure. This spoofing of addresses can be used for phishing attacks by fooling users into entering credentials, for example.",
    "Root cause": "The browser fails to reset the channel principal after a user cancels a proxy server's authentication prompt, leading to the display of the proxy's 407 response content as if it were the requested site's content.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of proxy authentication responses.",
      "Failure to invalidate the channel principal upon authentication cancellation.",
      "Displaying untrusted content within a trusted context (address bar)."
    ],
    "Impact": "Phishing attacks by spoofing the address bar and potentially tricking users into providing credentials to the malicious proxy server, leading to data compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack using a rogue proxy server.",
        "User browsing the web through a configured HTTP/HTTPS proxy",
        "User canceling the authentication prompt for the malicious proxy"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to intercept network traffic.",
      "Ability to set up a rogue proxy server.",
      "Ability to serve malicious 407 responses."
    ],
    "Additional details": "This vulnerability exists because the browser incorrectly displays the proxy server's 407 response instead of a browser-generated error page. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code into a page with the spoofed HTTPS address. The vulnerability is specifically triggered when a user cancels the authentication prompt, while if the user provides bad credentials, the browser displays a standard error page."
