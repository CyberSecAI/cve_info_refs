Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-0790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect type conversion between `PRBool` (4-byte) and `bool` (1-byte) when passing values to plugins. Specifically, when a 1-byte `bool` value is passed to a plugin expecting a 4-byte `PRBool`, it can lead to stack corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Type mismatch:  The core issue is a discrepancy in the size of data types when interacting with plugins.
- Stack corruption: The incorrect size of the data written onto the stack overwrites adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: Writing a 1-byte boolean value into memory allocated for a 4-byte boolean value causes stack corruption.
- Application crash: The stack corruption leads to crashes due to corrupted variables.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: While difficult in practice, the memory corruption could, in theory, be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Plugins: The vulnerability is triggered when Firefox interacts with plugins, specifically when calling `NPP_GetValue` and related functions and passing a boolean parameter.
- Specific plugins: It was found that some plugins (like Flash on Android) expect 4-byte boolean values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to load a malicious or specifically crafted plugin or use a vulnerable plugin.
- (For local code execution) Ability to cause stack corruption within the browser by using a specifically crafted plugin.
- The vulnerability is primarily applicable to Android, since OOPP was used by default on Desktop.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is described as a security-critical bug for Android.
- It is confirmed that the ASAN (AddressSanitizer) tool could be used to detect if this bug was reintroduced.
- The fix was implemented by using `uint32_t` instead of `bool` in the affected code paths, or by writing 4-byte boolean values.
- The vulnerability was a top-crash issue for Firefox Aurora and Beta channels.
- The fix was uplifted to Firefox Aurora and Beta.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 20, Firefox ESR 17.0.5 and later.
