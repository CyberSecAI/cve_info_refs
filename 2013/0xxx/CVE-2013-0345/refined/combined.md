storage routers (loadmasters).

Over the past year, we have received a lot of helpful input from our
users and have implemented substantial improvements. THANK YOU to
everyone who has contributed by reporting issues, providing feedback
and, just recently, adding documentation. SLASH/fellow has also helped
improve Varnish-Cache itself.

After rigorous testing in particular over the past weeks, we now
boldly claim that SLASH/ deserves a 1.0 version tag.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY Varnish-Cache!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY SLASH/buddy and SLASH/fellow!
