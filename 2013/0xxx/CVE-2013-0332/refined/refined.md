Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-0332:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a local file inclusion (LFI) issue caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `view`, `request`, and `action` parameters within ZoneMinder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks due to the lack of proper input validation. Attackers can inject ".." sequences into the affected parameters to navigate outside of the intended directories and access arbitrary files on the system.
- **Local File Inclusion:** By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, attackers can include and potentially read any files accessible to the webserver user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files, including configuration files, source code, and potentially even system files, which can expose confidential data and system information. This could enable further exploitation of the system or its users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploitable through web requests by manipulating the `view`, `request`, or `action` parameters with directory traversal sequences.
- The specific parameters are passed via `$_REQUEST`, suggesting they are exploitable through both GET and POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely via network access to the vulnerable ZoneMinder instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided information doesn't indicate a requirement for authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves sanitizing the vulnerable parameters with a `detaintPath` function, which removes ".." sequences and leading forward slashes.
- The vulnerable code was located in `web/index.php` and `web/includes/functions.php`.
- Patches for the vulnerability were released as SVN commits r3483 and r3488.
- The vulnerability was present in ZoneMinder versions prior to 1.24.4.
- The patched versions are 1.24.4 and 1.25.0

**Additional Notes:**
-  The vulnerability is described as "local file inclusion" but it is exploitable remotely via HTTP requests
- Patches were backported to the 1.24.2 branch in Debian to address the vulnerability.
-  The vulnerability is associated with the Debian bug report #700912
