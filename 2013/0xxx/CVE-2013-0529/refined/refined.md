Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0529:

**Summary:**
CVE-2013-0529, along with CVE-2013-0527, affects IBM Sterling Connect:Direct Browser. This vulnerability is related to information disclosure due to insecure cookie handling. Specifically, the HTTP session cookie lacked the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` attributes.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper configuration of HTTP session cookies in the IBM Sterling Connect:Direct Browser. The cookie was not being set with `secure` and `HttpOnly` attributes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure due to the insecure handling of session cookies.
- **Missing Secure Attribute:** The absence of the `Secure` attribute means the cookie could be transmitted over non-HTTPS connections, potentially exposing it to eavesdropping.
- **Missing HttpOnly Attribute:** The absence of the `HttpOnly` attribute means the cookie could be accessed by client-side scripts, increasing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially intercept session cookies if the connection is not secured (e.g., over HTTP) or via XSS.
- With stolen session cookies, an attacker could impersonate a legitimate user and gain access to the IBM Sterling Connect:Direct Browser interface.
- The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** If the cookie is transmitted over HTTP or other insecure channels, it can be intercepted by a network attacker.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If an attacker injects malicious client-side code, and the `HttpOnly` is missing, the attacker can steal the cookie and subsequently access user sessions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic if the `Secure` attribute is missing.
- **Ability to Inject Malicious Code:** For attacks that target the missing `HttpOnly` attribute, the attacker must be able to inject and execute code within the victim's browser (e.g., through XSS).

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was addressed by adding `cookieSecure=true` and `cookieHttpOnly=true` in the server.xml file for the web server running in IBM Sterling Control Center.
- This vulnerability is resolved in the versions of IBM Sterling Connect:Direct Browser that include the fix for APAR IC90478.
