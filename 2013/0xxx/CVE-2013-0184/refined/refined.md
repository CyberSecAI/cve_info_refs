{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Rack::Auth::AbstractRequest` component in rubygem-rack symbolizes arbitrary strings without proper sanitization or checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending specially crafted requests, leading to excessive resource consumption on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network requests"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to send network requests to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is related to how the Rack library processes authentication requests and symbolizes strings. The fix involves preventing arbitrary string symbolization."
