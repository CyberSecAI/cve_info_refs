Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-0334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Bundler, a dependency management tool for Ruby, handles multiple gem sources within a `Gemfile`.
- Prior to version 1.7, Bundler did not properly distinguish between different gem sources when installing gems. If multiple sources (e.g., rubygems.org and gems.github.com) hosted gems with the same name, Bundler might install a gem from an unintended source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Dependency Resolution:** Bundler versions before 1.7 did not enforce source-specific gem resolution when multiple top-level `source` lines were used in a `Gemfile`. This allowed the possibility of installing a gem from an unexpected source, even if a specific source was intended.
- **Lack of Source Awareness:** Older versions of Bundler were unable to reliably distinguish between different gem servers, making it vulnerable to source confusion attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A malicious actor could create a gem with the same name as a legitimate gem on a different (possibly untrusted) source. If a user's `Gemfile` used multiple sources and included the legitimate gem, Bundler could be tricked into installing the malicious gem from the untrusted source.
- **Compromised Application:** By installing a malicious gem, an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the Ruby application using Bundler, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Gem Creation:** The primary attack vector involves creating a malicious gem with the same name as a legitimate gem on an alternative, possibly untrusted, gem source.
- **Multi-Source Gemfile:** The attack relies on the existence of a `Gemfile` with multiple top-level `source` lines, without source specification for individual gems, or source blocks.
- **`bundle install` Command:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user executes `bundle install`, which fetches and installs gems based on the `Gemfile`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Publish Gems:** The attacker needs the ability to publish gems to a gem repository, such as rubygems.org or a private gem server.
- **Knowledge of Gem Names:** The attacker must know the names of commonly used gems that are available from multiple sources.
- **Target User's `Gemfile`:**  The attacker must rely on a target user's `Gemfile` utilizing multiple top-level gem sources.

**Mitigation**

- The vulnerability is resolved in Bundler 1.7 and later. Upgrading to this version or later will protect against this specific vulnerability
- Explicitly specify the gem source using `source` blocks, and individual gem specifications.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Andreas Loupasakis and Fotos Georgiadis.
- The Bundler and RubyGems.org teams worked together to mitigate the issue by copying most gems from gems.github.com to rubygems.org, reducing the potential for attacks.
- Backporting a fix to older versions of Bundler was deemed impractical due to limitations in those versions.
