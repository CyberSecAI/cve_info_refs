  "CVE-2013-0281": {
    "Description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way Pacemaker, an advanced, scalable high-availability cluster resource manager for Linux-HA (Heartbeat) and/or Corosync, performed authentication and processing of remote connections in certain circumstances. In general Pacemaker used a blocking socket (without a timeout) to wait for authentication credentials to arrive. When Pacemaker was configured to allow remote Cluster Information Base (CIB) cluster's configuration / cluster's resources management, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause Pacemaker to block indefinitely (preventing it from serving another requests).",
    "Root cause": "Pacemaker used a blocking socket (without a timeout) to wait for authentication credentials to arrive.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of blocking sockets without timeout when handling remote connections"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could cause Pacemaker to block indefinitely, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote network connection to Pacemaker with remote CIB management enabled."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to establish a remote connection to the Pacemaker service.  The CIB management functionality must also be enabled on the Pacemaker instance."
