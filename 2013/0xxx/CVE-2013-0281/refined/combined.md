RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-04 13:44:18 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way Pacemaker, an advanced, scalable high-availability cluster resource manager for Linux-HA (Heartbeat) and/or Corosync, performed authentication and processing of remote connections in certain circumstances. In general Pacemaker used a blocking socket (without a timeout) to wait for authentication credentials to arrive. When Pacemaker was configured to allow remote Cluster Information Base (CIB) cluster's configuration / cluster's resources management, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause Pacemaker to block indefinitely (preventing it from serving another requests).  Important Note: In the default configuration of Pacemaker in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 the remote CIB management feature / functionality is turned off.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-04 13:46:15 UTC  ``` This issue was found by David Vossel of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-04 13:59:46 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of the pacemaker package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the pacemaker package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16 and 17.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-13 15:38:59 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2013-0281](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0281) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-14 10:27:46 UTC  ``` Relevant upstream patch: <https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/commit/564f7cc2a51dcd2f28ab12a13394f31be5aa3c93>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-14 16:41:57 UTC  ``` Created pacemaker tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 911291](show_bug.cgi?id=911291 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-0281 pacemaker: Denial of service when remote CIB management enabled due to use of no-timeout blocking socket to wait for the arrival of the authentication credentials [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-21 11:55:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1635 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1635.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c9)  Huzaifa S.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c0)  Jaroslav Kortus    2013-01-21 15:40:59 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When I set up a Master/Slave resource and issue pcs resource move <resource>, then each time different part of the set can be moved (or shut down in this case).  After discussing this with David Vossel, it seems that the first resource found on lowest node id wins and it's always moved.  This has the consequence, that sometimes the master instance is moved, and sometimes the slave instance is moved. In first case the master is re-elected, in both cases the slave instance is just shut down on the node (due to the constraint created).  It would be good to have consistent approach on what should happen from user point of view. My favourite would be to force shutdown of the master instance and new master election.  This bug is more a request for discussion about how it should really behave and if current behaviour is the best one.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): pacemaker-1.1.8-7.el6.x86_64  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. pcs resource create dummystateful ocf:pacemaker:Stateful 2. pcs resource master MasterResource dummystateful 3. pcs resoure move MasterResource    Actual results: lowest node-id instance is "moved", which may or may not be the master one  Expected results: I'd go for master instance being moved at all times or error if there is no master yet.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c2)  RHEL Program Management    2013-01-25 06:48:00 UTC  ``` This request was not resolved in time for the current release. Red Hat invites you to ask your support representative to propose this request, if still desired, for consideration in the next release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c3)  Andrew Beekhof    2013-02-06 06:08:18 UTC  ``` Chris, what crm_resource command does "pcs resoure move MasterResource" expand to for m/s resources?   I'm thinking move for a master/slave resource doesn't make much sense (unless a node is specified and interpreted to mean the place where the resource can no longer run).   We'd need to add support for that to crm_resource   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c4)  Chris Feist    2013-04-10 03:56:34 UTC  ``` If a node is specified, I use: crm_resource --resource resource_id --move --node node_id   If not, I use: crm_resource --resource resource_id --move  I don't do any special for different types of resources (master/slave, clones).  Should I prevent users from running that command with master/slave resources or clones and just print an error message telling them if they really want to do that they should be creating constraints?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c5)  Andrew Beekhof    2013-05-15 05:51:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c4)) > If a node is specified, I use: > crm_resource --resource resource_id --move --node node_id  >  > If not, I use: > crm_resource --resource resource_id --move >  > I don't do any special for different types of resources (master/slave, > clones). >  > Should I prevent users from running that command with master/slave resources > or clones and just print an error message telling them if they really want > to do that they should be creating constraints?  Yep, I think thats what we want to do, but it should probably happen at the crm_resource level so you don't have to care.  Although if you detect it early the error message might be a little nicer :)  Jaroslav: Do you agree with the approach?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c6)  Jaroslav Kortus    2013-05-15 08:31:28 UTC  ``` That would make sense. Can you please print the command creating the constraint to stderr? I think users would be glad to see next command instead of having to look it up in help.  Also, is there a way to move the master resource, i.e. force some other node to be the master?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c7)  Andrew Beekhof    2013-05-30 03:42:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jaroslav Kortus from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c6)) > That would make sense.

Deprecate crm_resource --move when --host is not specified.    --move is then just for pushing resources to a particular location,     not for "anywhere but here" 2.

When I say "move" I mean "go away", not having --host seems perfectly OK to me. So I'm -1 on this :).   > # Stop a resource (including clones) from being allow to run at a particular > location > # > # If 'something' is a group or primitive: > #  - move it from its current location to 'somewhere' > # If 'something' is a m/s resource and there is only one master: > #  - move the master from its current location to another 'somewhere' > # Otherwise, > #  - error > crm_resource --move --resource something --host somewhere   > # Stop a resource (including clones) from being allow to run at a  > # particular location > # > # If --host is not specified and 'something' is a group or primitive: > #  - move it from its current location to another node > # If --host is not specified and 'something' is a m/s resource and there is > # only one master: > #  - move the master from its current location to another node > # Otherwise, if --host is not specified > #  - error > crm_resource --ban --resource something --host somewhere  Isn't this what --move would do?

Removing it completely would be a really good way for me to piss off almost everyone :)  The intention though, is that --ban (potentially with no --host) would be the "better way" to do the same thing.   >  >  > > # Stop a resource (including clones) from being allow to run at a particular > > location > > # > > # If 'something' is a group or primitive: > > #  - move it from its current location to 'somewhere' > > # If 'something' is a m/s resource and there is only one master: > > #  - move the master from its current location to another 'somewhere' > > # Otherwise, > > #  - error > > crm_resource --move --resource something --host somewhere >   > > # Stop a resource (including clones) from being allow to run at a  > > # particular location > > # > > # If --host is not specified and 'something' is a group or primitive: > > #  - move it from its current location to another node > > # If --host is not specified and 'something' is a m/s resource and there is > > # only one master: > > #  - move the master from its current location to another node > > # Otherwise, if --host is not specified > > #  - error > > crm_resource --ban --resource something --host somewhere >  > Isn't this what --move would do?

For --move its "the node on which it should run now".  There is much overlap, but one can't completely replace the other. Eg. There is no single --ban command that lets you move a resource to a specific node.  > >  > > # Re-allow a resource (including clones) to run at a particular location > > # > > # If --host is not specified, remove all generated constraints > > crm_resource --unban --resource something --host somewhere > >  > > # Stop a m/s resource from being promoted at a particular location > > # The resource can still be a slave on that node > > # If --host is not specified and there is only one master: > > #  - move the master from its current location to another node > > # Otherwise, if --host is not specified > > #  - error > > crm_resource --ban-master --resource someclone --host somewhere > >  > > # Re-allow a m/s resource to be promoted at a particular location > > # If --host is not specified, remove all generated constraints > > crm_resource --unban-master --resource someclone --host somewhere > >  > >  > > Examples: > >  > > ==== > >  > > Assume: 'www' group running on 'node1'  > >  > > node1 - 'www' > > node2 -  > > node3 -  > >  > > # crm_resource --ban www > > # Creates --ban for node1 > >  > > node1 - > > node2 - 'www'  > > node3 -  > >  > > # crm_resource --ban www --host node2 > >  > > node1 - > > node2 - > > node3 - 'www'  > >  > > # crm_resource --move www --host node2 > > # Undoes --ban for node2 > > # Creates --ban for node3 > >  > > node1 - > > node2 - 'www' > > node3 -  > >  > > # crm_resource --unban www --host node1 > > # Might move back to node1 based on stickiness > >  > > node1 - 'www' > > node2 - > > node3 -  > >  > > ==== > >  > > Assume:  > > node1 - mysql:master > > node2 - mysql:slave > >  > > # crm_resource --ban-master mysql > >  > > node1 - mysql:master > > node2 - mysql:slave > >  >  > should not this be like this?: > node1 - mysql:slave > node2 - mysql:master  Yes.  >  > > # crm_resource --ban-master mysql --host node2 > >  > > node1 - mysql:slave > > node2 - mysql:slave > >  > > # crm_resource --ban mysql --host node1 > >  > > node1 -  > > node2 - mysql:slave > >  >  > > # crm_resource --unban mysql --host node2 > >  > > node1 -  > > node2 - mysql:master > This should probably be --unban-master here.

I made a head start on this and ironed out some kinks. This is the current help text which make the need for both more obvious:   Resource location:  -M, --move 	Move a resource from its current location to the named destination.   		Requires: --host. Optional: --lifetime, --master  		NOTE: This may prevent the resource from running on the previous  		location node until the implicit constraints expire or are removed 		with --unban   -B, --ban 	Prevent the named resource from running on the named --host.   		Requires: --resource. Optional: --host, --lifetime, --master  		If --host is not specified, it defaults to: 		 * the curent location for primitives and groups, or 		 * the curent location of the master for m/s resources with master-max=1  		All other situations result in an error as there is no sane default.  		NOTE: This will prevent the resource from running on this node until 		the constraint expires or is removed with --clear   -U, --clear 	Remove all constraints created by the --ban and/or --move commands.   		Requires: --resource. Optional: --host, --master  		If --host is not specified, all constraints created by --ban and 		--move will be removed for the named resource.   -u, --lifetime=value		 		Lifespan of constraints created by the --ban and --move commands       --master 	Limit the scope of the --ban, --move and --clear  commands to the 		Master role. 		For --ban, the previous master can still remain active in the Slave role.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c11)  Andrew Beekhof    2013-05-31 02:35:24 UTC  ``` Oh, and we need a QE ack please :)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=902407#c12)  Jaroslav Kortus    2013-05-31 08:47:12 UTC  ``` > > > 1.

You may need to wait up to 'cluster-recheck-interval' for the expiration to take effect.         cluster-recheck-interval = time [15min]            Polling interval for time based changes to options, resource parameters and constraints.             The Cluster is primarily event driven, however the configuration can have elements that change based on time. To ensure these changes take effect, we can optionally poll the cluster's status for changes. Allowed values: Zero disables polling. Positive values are an            interval in seconds (unless other SI units are specified. eg. 5min)    >  > And btw, "P60S" was really not intuitive to me.

## Topic

Updated pacemaker packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Pacemaker is a high-availability cluster resource manager with a powerful
policy engine.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Pacemaker performed
authentication and processing of remote connections in certain
circumstances. When Pacemaker was configured to allow remote Cluster
Information Base (CIB) configuration or resource management, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to cause Pacemaker to block indefinitely
(preventing it from serving other requests). (CVE-2013-0281)

Note: The default Pacemaker configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has
the remote CIB management functionality disabled.

The pacemaker package has been upgraded to upstream version 1.1.10, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version:

* Pacemaker no longer assumes unknown cman nodes are safely stopped.
* The core dump file now converts all exit codes into positive 'errno'

values.

* Pacemaker ensures a return to a stable state after too many fencing

failures, and initiates a shutdown if a node claimed to be fenced is still
active.

* The crm\_error tool adds the ability to list and print error symbols.
* The crm\_resource command allows individual resources to be reprobed, and

implements the "--ban" option for moving resources away from nodes.
The "--clear" option has replaced the "--unmove" option. Also, crm\_resource
now supports OCF tracing when using the "--force" option.

* The IPC mechanism restores the ability for members of the haclient group

to connect to the cluster.

* The Policy Engine daemon allows active nodes in the current membership to

be fenced without quorum.

* Policy Engine now suppresses meaningless IDs when displaying anonymous

clone status, supports maintenance mode for a single node, and correctly
handles the recovered resources before they are operated on.

* XML configuration files are now checked for non-printing characters and

replaced with their octal equivalent when exporting XML text. Also, a more
reliable buffer allocation strategy has been implemented to prevent
lockups.

(BZ#987355)

Additional bug fixes:

* The "crm\_resource --move" command was designed for atomic resources and

could not handle resources on clones, masters, or slaves present on
multiple nodes. Consequently, crm\_resource could not obtain enough
information to move a resource and did not perform any action. The "--ban"
and "--clear" options have been added to allow the administrator to
instruct the cluster unambiguously. Clone, master, and slave resources can
now be navigated within the cluster as expected. (BZ#902407)

* The hacluster user account did not have a user identification (UID) or

group identification (GID) number reserved on the system. Thus, UID and GID
values were picked randomly during the installation process. The UID and
GID number 189 was reserved for hacluster and is now used consistently for
all installations. (BZ#908450)

* Certain clusters used node host names that did not match the output of

the "uname -n" command. Thus, the default node name used by the crm\_standby
and crm\_failcount commands was incorrect and caused the cluster to ignore
the update by the administrator. The crm\_node command is now used instead
of the uname utility in helper scripts. As a result, the cluster behaves as
expected. (BZ#913093)

* Due to incorrect return code handling, internal recovery logic of the

crm\_mon utility was not executed when a configuration updated failed to
apply, leading to an assertion failure. Return codes are now checked
correctly, and the recovery of an expected error state is now handled
transparently. (BZ#951371)

* cman's automatic unfencing feature failed when combined with Pacemaker.

Support for automated unfencing in Pacemaker has been added, and the
unwanted behavior no longer occurs. (BZ#996850)

All pacemaker users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-04 13:44:18 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way Pacemaker, an advanced, scalable high-availability cluster resource manager for Linux-HA (Heartbeat) and/or Corosync, performed authentication and processing of remote connections in certain circumstances. In general Pacemaker used a blocking socket (without a timeout) to wait for authentication credentials to arrive. When Pacemaker was configured to allow remote Cluster Information Base (CIB) cluster's configuration / cluster's resources management, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause Pacemaker to block indefinitely (preventing it from serving another requests).  Important Note: In the default configuration of Pacemaker in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 the remote CIB management feature / functionality is turned off.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-04 13:46:15 UTC  ``` This issue was found by David Vossel of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-04 13:59:46 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of the pacemaker package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the pacemaker package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16 and 17.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-13 15:38:59 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2013-0281](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0281) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-14 10:27:46 UTC  ``` Relevant upstream patch: <https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/commit/564f7cc2a51dcd2f28ab12a13394f31be5aa3c93>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-14 16:41:57 UTC  ``` Created pacemaker tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 911291](show_bug.cgi?id=911291 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-0281 pacemaker: Denial of service when remote CIB management enabled due to use of no-timeout blocking socket to wait for the arrival of the authentication credentials [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-21 11:55:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1635 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1635.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=891922#c9)  Huzaifa S.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
