Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2013-0083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises because Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly handle malicious JavaScript elements embedded within specially crafted site content. This allows the script to be executed within the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability, where the malicious script is injected into the page and executed when a user views the crafted content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can potentially execute SharePoint commands in the context of an administrative user, gaining unauthorized access and control over the site.
- **Data Breaches and Manipulation:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read unauthorized content, use the victim's identity to perform actions on their behalf (e.g. change permissions, delete content), and inject further malicious content into the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Site Content:** The attacker must insert malicious JavaScript code into a SharePoint site content.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires a user, typically a SharePoint administrator, to visit the page with the specially crafted content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to inject content into a SharePoint site:** The attacker must have the access/permissions required to introduce malicious javascript into a page's content.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a SharePoint administrator to view the malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Critical" for Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 Service Pack 1.
