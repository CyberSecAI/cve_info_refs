Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-0272:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Pidgin handles long HTTP headers within the MXit protocol handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient checks on the length of HTTP headers received in the MXit protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the Pidgin application, potentially causing a denial of service.
- There's also the potential for remote code execution, meaning an attacker could gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious remote server or a man-in-the-middle attacker sending specially crafted, overly long HTTP header data to the Pidgin client via the MXit protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to act as or impersonate a malicious MXit server, or position themselves as a man-in-the-middle, to intercept and modify the data sent to the Pidgin client.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted data that causes the buffer overflow.
