Security researchers have confirmed that the latest version of Oracle's Java software framework is vulnerable to Web hacks that allow attackers to install malware on end users' computers.

"We have successfully confirmed that a complete Java security sandbox bypass can be still gained under the recent version of Java 7 Update 11 (JRE version 1.7.0\_11-b21)," Adam Gowdiak, CEO of Poland-based Security Explorations, wrote in an [advisory posted Friday](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Jan/142) to the Full Disclosure mailing list. "As a result, two new security vulnerabilities (51 and 52) were spotted in a recent version of Java SE 7 code and they were reported to Oracle today (along with a working Proof of Concept code)."

Gowdiak's advisory comes a few days after researchers from security firms Trend Micro and Immunity Inc. independently reported the [emergency patch Oracle released on Sunday](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/01/oracle-patches-widespread-java-zero-day-bug-in-just-three-days-that-is/) was incomplete. While attacks [actively waged online last week](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/01/critical-java-zero-day-bug-is-being-massively-exploited-in-the-wild/) exploited two vulnerabilities in the an older version to surreptitiously install malware on computers that browsed to malicious websites, Java 7 Update 11 fixed only one of them, those researchers said. On Wednesday, KrebsOnSecurity reported [exploit code for that version was being sold](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/01/5000-will-buy-you-access-to-another-new-critical-java-vulnerability/) in underground Internet forums.

In an e-mail, Gowdiak told Ars that his exploits aren't able to bypass a security protection added to Sunday's Update 11 that prevents unsigned or self-signed Java applets from running in a browser unless the end-user clicks an OK button. He said his attack would still work if attackers are able to use social engineering techniques to trick users into allowing the applet. Attackers likely could also circumvent the protection by using a stolen valid certificate.

As Ars has advised in the past, readers who have no use for Java should consider removing program plug-ins from their browsers, or uninstalling Java altogether from their computer. Those who rely on Java can also enable a plug-in in a browser dedicated for that purpose and use a separate browser for all other websites. Java 6, which Oracle is still supporting for the time being, hasn't been vulnerable to most of the recent exploits, although security experts remain mixed on whether it is a more secure alternative to Java 7. Gowdiak said one of the vulnerabilities Security Explorations discovered this week works on both versions while the other works only on Java 7.

Representatives from Oracle didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment for this article.

*Story updated to include details in second to last paragraph about which versions of Java are vulnerable to latest exploits.*

# Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - February 2013

## Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - February 2013

**Note:** *The original Critical Patch Update for Java SE – February 2013 was scheduled to be released on February 19th, but Oracle decided to accelerate the release of this Critical Patch Update because active exploitation “in the wild” of one of the vulnerabilities affecting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in desktop browsers, was addressed with this Critical Patch Update.*

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update and Security Alert. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update and Security Alert advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

 **Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 50 new security fixes across Java SE products.

### Supported Products Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PatchTable) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Affected product releases and versions:

| Java SE | Patch Availability |
| --- | --- |
| JDK and JRE 7 Update 11 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| JDK and JRE 6 Update 38 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 38 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_40 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| JavaFX 2.2.4 and earlier | [JavaFX](/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html) |

### Patch Availability Table and Risk Matrix

Java SE fixes in this Update are cumulative; the latest Critical Patch Update includes all fixes from the previous Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts (including Security Alert CVE-2013-0422).

#### Patch Availability Table

| Product Group | Risk Matrix | Patch Availability and Installation Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oracle Java SE | [Oracle JDK and JRE Risk Matrix](#AppendixJAVA) | * Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update February 2013 [My Oracle Support Note 1524383.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1524383.1) * Developers can download the latest release from [http://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html.](/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) * Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com.](//java.com)  Users on the Windows platform can also use [automatic updates](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/5000020700.xml) to get the latest release. * Developers and users can download the latest Java FX release from [http://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html](/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html) |

#### Risk Matrix Content

The risk matrix lists only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for [previous](/security-alerts/) security fixes can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Document, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply these fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Security advisories, please review [previous](/security-alerts/) advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer supported. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 50 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  49 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/javacpufeb2013verbose.html).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

For issues in Deployment, fixes are only made available for JDK and JRE 7 and 6. Users should use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start in the latest JDK and JRE 7 or 6 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

#### Notes:

1. Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using untrusted Java Web Start applications or untrusted Java applets, such as through a web service.
2. Applies to client deployment of Java only. This vulnerability can be exploited only through untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets. (Untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted applets run in the Java sandbox with limited privileges.)
3. Applies to installation process on client deployment of Java.
4. Applies to server deployments of JSSE.
5. This issue (CVE-2013-1489) has been discussed publicly and is sometimes known as the "Java Security Slider vulnerability". It has a CVSS of 0 because it does not directly result in an exploitation, but may be combined with other vulnerabilities to allow blind exploitation. When the Security Slider is set to the default (high) all unsigned applets must be authorized via a dialog box by a browser user in order to execute. This provides the browser operator the opportunity to prevent execution of suspicious applets that may result in successful exploits. However, when CVE-2013-1489 is combined with vulnerabilities that can be used to cause direct impacts, the effect can be that the impact can be caused "silently" without the authorization dialog box.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=906447#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-31 16:27:55 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2013-0431](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0431) to the following vulnerability:  Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 11 (JRE 1.7.0_11-b21) allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass the Java security sandbox via unspecified vectors, aka "Issue 52," a different vulnerability than [CVE-2013-1490](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1490). NOTE: as of 20130130, this vulnerability does not contain any independently-verifiable details, and there is no vendor acknowledgement. A CVE identifier is being assigned because this vulnerability has received significant public attention, and the original researcher has an established history of releasing vulnerability reports that have been fixed by vendors.

The vulnerability has its origin   in com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.Introspector class which is located   in the same package as the infamous MBeanInstantiator bug found   in the wild in early Jan 2013. The flaw stems from insecure call   to invoke method of java.lang.reflect.Method class:               if (method != null)                  return method.invoke(obj, new Object[0]);      In our Proof of Concept code we exploit the above implementation   by making a call to getDeclaredMethods method of java.lang.Class   class to gain access to methods of restricted classes. This is   accomplished with the use of the following code sequence:      Introspector.elementFromComplex((Object)clazz,"declaredMethods")      Access to public method objects of arbitrary restricted classes   is sufficient to achieve a complete Java VM security sandbox   compromise. We make use of DefiningClassLoader exploit vector   for that purpose.

## Synopsis

Important: java-1.7.0-openjdk security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0247)

## Topic

Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages that fix several security issues are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

These packages provide the OpenJDK 7 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 7 Software Development Kit.

Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the AWT,
CORBA, JMX, Libraries, and Beans components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java
application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox
restrictions. (CVE-2013-0442, CVE-2013-0445, CVE-2013-0441, CVE-2013-1475,
CVE-2013-1476, CVE-2013-0429, CVE-2013-0450, CVE-2013-0425, CVE-2013-0426,
CVE-2013-0428, CVE-2013-0444)

Multiple flaws were found in the way image parsers in the 2D and AWT
components handled image raster parameters. A specially-crafted image could
cause Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to
arbitrary code execution with the virtual machine privileges.
(CVE-2013-1478, CVE-2013-1480)

A flaw was found in the AWT component's clipboard handling code. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to access
clipboard data, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2013-0432)

The default Java security properties configuration did not restrict access
to certain com.sun.xml.internal packages. An untrusted Java application or
applet could use this flaw to access information, bypassing certain Java
sandbox restrictions. This update lists the whole package as restricted.
(CVE-2013-0435)

Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the JMX,
Libraries, Networking, and JAXP components. An untrusted Java application
or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox
restrictions. (CVE-2013-0431, CVE-2013-0427, CVE-2013-0433, CVE-2013-0434)

It was discovered that the RMI component's CGIHandler class used user
inputs in error messages without any sanitization. An attacker could use
this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. (CVE-2013-0424)

It was discovered that the SSL/TLS implementation in the JSSE component
did not properly enforce handshake message ordering, allowing an unlimited
number of handshake restarts. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
make an SSL/TLS server using JSSE consume an excessive amount of CPU by
continuously restarting the handshake. (CVE-2013-0440)

It was discovered that the JSSE component did not properly validate
Diffie-Hellman public keys. An SSL/TLS client could possibly use this flaw
to perform a small subgroup attack. (CVE-2013-0443)

This erratum also upgrades the OpenJDK package to IcedTea7 2.3.5. Refer to
the NEWS file, linked to in the References, for further information.

All users of java-1.7.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## MGASA-2013-0056

| **Date:** | February 17th, 2013 |
| --- | --- |
| **Affected releases:** | 2 |
| **Media:** | Core |

**Description:**

Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages fix security vulnerabilities:

Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the AWT,

CORBA, JMX, Libraries, and Beans components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java

application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox

restrictions (CVE-2013-0442, CVE-2013-0445, CVE-2013-0441, CVE-2013-1475,

CVE-2013-1476, CVE-2013-0429, CVE-2013-0450, CVE-2013-0425, CVE-2013-0426,

CVE-2013-0428, CVE-2013-0444).

Multiple flaws were found in the way image parsers in the 2D and AWT

components handled image raster parameters. A specially-crafted image could

cause Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to

arbitrary code execution with the virtual machine privileges

(CVE-2013-1478, CVE-2013-1480).

A flaw was found in the AWT component's clipboard handling code. An

untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to access

clipboard data, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-0432).

The default Java security properties configuration did not restrict access

to certain com.sun.xml.internal packages. An untrusted Java application or

applet could use this flaw to access information, bypassing certain Java

sandbox restrictions. This update lists the whole package as restricted

(CVE-2013-0435).

Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the JMX,

Libraries, Networking, and JAXP components. An untrusted Java application

or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox

restrictions (CVE-2013-0431, CVE-2013-0427, CVE-2013-0433, CVE-2013-0434).

It was discovered that the RMI component's CGIHandler class used user

inputs in error messages without any sanitization. An attacker could use

this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack (CVE-2013-0424).

It was discovered that the SSL/TLS implementation in the JSSE component

did not properly enforce handshake message ordering, allowing an unlimited

number of handshake restarts. A remote attacker could use this flaw to

make an SSL/TLS server using JSSE consume an excessive amount of CPU by

continuously restarting the handshake (CVE-2013-0440).

It was discovered that the JSSE component did not properly validate

Diffie-Hellman public keys. An SSL/TLS client could possibly use this flaw

to perform a small subgroup attack (CVE-2013-0443).

IcedTea has been updated to version 2.3.6, which fixes these issues.

```

Issue 51 affects both Java SE 6 and 7. Issue 52 is for Java SE 7
only. Since both issues are required for the attack to succeed,
we treat it as Java 7 specific only.

Thank you.

## Oracle Java contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#858729

Original Release Date: 2013-02-01 | Last Revised: 2013-06-14

---

### Overview

Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier versions of Java contain vulnerabilities that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows users to run Java applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Oracle has made the JRE available for multiple operating systems.  The Java JRE plug-in provides its own [Security Manager](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29). Typically, a web applet runs with a security manager provided by the browser or Java Web Start plugin. Oracle's document [states](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#setSecurityManager%28java.lang.SecurityManager%29), *"If there is a security manager already installed, this method first calls the security manager's* *checkPermission* *method with a* *RuntimePermission("setSecurityManager")* *permission to ensure it's safe to replace the existing security manager. This may result in throwing a* *SecurityException"**.* By leveraging a number of vulnerabilities, an untrusted Java applet can escalate its privileges to allow full privileges, without requiring code signing. Other vulnerabilities can cause exploitable memory corruption, which could affect Java applets, as well as Java applications, depending on what the Java application does and how it may process untrusted data. Oracle Java 7 Update 11, Java 6 Update 38, and earlier Java versions are affected.At least one of these vulnerabilities is reportedly being exploited in the wild. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Note that applications that use the Internet Explorer web content rendering components, such as Microsoft Office or Windows Desktop Search, may also be used as an attack vector for these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities that affect server deployments of Java may be exploited by causing a Java server application to process untrusted data. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These issues are addressed in Java 7 Update 13 and Java 6 Update 39. Please see the [Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) - February 2013 for more details. |
| --- |

| **Disable Java in web browsers**Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to [disable Java content in web browsers](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml) through the Java control panel applet. Please see the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable) for more details.System administrators wishing to deploy Java 7 Update 10 or later with the "Enable Java content in the browser" feature disabled can invoke the Java installer with the WEB\_JAVA=0 command-line option. More details are available in the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#install).Alternatively, Microsoft has released a [Fix it](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/05/29/java-when-you-cannot-let-go.aspx) that disables Java in the Internet Explorer web browser.**Restrict access to Java applets**Network administrators unable to disable Java in web browsers may be able to help mitigate this and other Java vulnerabilities by restricting access to Java applets. This may be accomplished by using proxy server rules, for example. Blocking or whitelisting web requests to .jar and .class files can help to prevent Java from being used by untrusted sources. Filtering requests that contain a Java User-Agent header may also be effective. For example, this technique can be used in environments where Java is required on the local intranet. The proxy can be configured to allow Java requests locally, but block them when the destination is a site on the internet. |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-31 16:28:56 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2013-1489](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1489) to the following vulnerability:  Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 10 and Update 11 (JRE 1.7.0_11-b21) and possibly other versions, when running on Windows using Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Google Chrome, allows remote attackers to bypass the "Very High" security level of the Java Control Panel and execute unsigned Java code without prompting the user via unknown vectors, aka "Issue 53." NOTE: as of 20130130, this vulnerability does not contain any independently-verifiable details, and there is no vendor acknowledgement. A CVE identifier is being assigned because this vulnerability is receiving significant public attention, and the original researcher has an established history of releasing vulnerability reports that have been fixed by vendors.

IcedTea-Web plugin for OpenJDK does not currently offer similar security feature.  Additionally, according to the limited information in the public report, this problem is about bypassing Security Level protection, and it is not a Java sandbox restriction.  Hence this needs to be combined with other flaw to achieve code execution.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-01 21:10:01 UTC  ``` This issue is now fixed in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 13, including the following note:    This issue ([CVE-2013-1489](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1489)) has been discussed publicly and is sometimes known   as the "Java Security Slider vulnerability". It has a CVSS of 0 because it   does not directly result in an exploitation, but may be combined with other   vulnerabilities to allow blind exploitation. When the Security Slider is set   to the default (high) all unsigned applets must be authorized via a dialog   box by a browser user in order to execute. This provides the browser operator   the opportunity to prevent execution of suspicious applets that may result in   successful exploits. However, when [CVE-2013-1489](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1489) is combined with   vulnerabilities that can be used to cause direct impacts, the effect can be   that the impact can be caused "silently" without the authorization dialog box.  External Reference:  <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-04 17:23:10 UTC  ``` Additional details from Adam Gowdiak of Security Explorations:  <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Feb/12>    [Issue 53]   Issue 53 stems from the fact that Oracle's implementation of new   security levels introduced by the company in Java SE 7 Update 10   did not take into account the fact that Applets can be instantiated   with the use of serialization. Such a possibility is indicated both   in HTML 4 Specification [5] as well as in Oracle's code.      HTML 4 Specification contains the following description for the   "object" attribute of APPLET element:      object = cdata [CS]           This attribute names a resource containing a serialized           representation of an applet's state. It is interpreted           relative to the applet's codebase. The serialized data           contains the applet's class name but not the implementation.           The class name is used to retrieve the implementation from           a class file or archive.      Additionally, Java 7 Update 10 (and 11) reveal the following code   logic when it comes to the implementation of new security features   (Java Control Panel security levels).      [excerpt from sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2Manager class]               String object_attr = getSerializedObject();            String code_attr   = getCode();            ...               if(code_attr != null) {                Class class1 = plugin2classloader.loadCode(code_attr);                ...                if(class1 != null)                       if (fireAppletSSVValidation())                    ...            } else {                if(!isSecureVM)                    return;       adapter.instantiateSerialApplet(plugin2classloader,object_attr);                ...            }      The above clearly shows that the conditional block implementing   Applet instantiation via deserialization does not contain a call   to fireAppletSSVValidation method. This method conducts important   security checks corresponding to security levels configured by   Java Control Panel. The lack of a call to security checking method   is equivalent to "no protection at all" as it allows for a silent   Java exploit in particular.      What's worth mentioning is that for Google Chrome the following   HTML sequence needed to be used to activate target Applet code:      <object type="application/x-java-applet" object="BlackBox.ser">    [5] HTML 4 Specification, Including an applet: the APPLET element   <http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#h-13.4>  Original report: <http://www.security-explorations.com/materials/SE-2012-01-ORACLE-9.pdf>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:54:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0237 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0237.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-06 08:24:42 UTC  ``` Nico Waisman's (Immunity) blog post detailing this issue, with the same finding as posted by Adam Gowdiak ([comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=906449#c3)):  <http://immunityproducts.blogspot.com/2013/02/keep-calm-and-run-this-applet.html>   ``` |  |

Alert
# Oracle Java Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedOctober 19, 2016
Alert CodeTA13-032A

### Systems Affected

Any system using Oracle Java including

* JDK and JRE 7 Update 11 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 6 Update 38 and earlier
* JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 38 and earlier
* SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_40 and earlier
* JavaFX 2.2.4 and earlier
* Java 1.6.0\_37 and earlier for Mac OS X and OS X Server 10.6.8

Web browsers using the Java plug-in are at high risk.

### Overview

Multiple vulnerabilities in Java could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

The Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory for [February 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Both Java applets delivered via web browsers and stand-alone Java applications are affected, however web browsers using the Java plug-in are at particularly high risk.

The Java plug-in, the Java Deployment Toolkit plug-in, and Java Web Start can be used as attack vectors. An attacker could use social engineering techniques to entice a user to visit a link to a website hosting a malicious Java applet. An attacker could also compromise a legitimate web site and upload a malicious Java applet (a "drive-by download" attack).

Some vulnerabilities affect stand-alone Java applications, depending on how the Java application functions and how it processes untrusted data.

Reports indicate that at least one of these vulnerabilities is being actively exploited.

Further technical details are available in Vulnerability Note [VU#858729](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/858729).

### Impact

By convincing a user to load a malicious Java applet or Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the Java plug-in process.

Stand-alone java applications may also be affected.

### Solution

**Update Java**

The Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory for [February 2013](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html) states that Java 7 Update 13 and Java 6 Update 39 address these vulnerabilities.

**Disable Java in web browsers**

These and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered. To defend against this and future Java vulnerabilities, consider disabling Java in web browsers until adequate updates have been installed. As with any software, unnecessary features should be disabled or removed as appropriate for your environment.

Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to disable Java content in web browsers through the Java control panel applet. From [Setting the Security Level of the Java Client](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable):

For installations where the highest level of security is required, it is possible to entirely prevent *any* Java apps (signed or unsigned) from running in a browser by de-selecting Enable Java content in the browser in the Java Control Panel under the Security tab.

If you are unable to update to Java 7 Update 13 please see the solution section of Vulnerability Note [VU#636312](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312#solution) for instructions on how to disable Java on a per-browser basis.

**Restrict access to Java applets**

Network administrators unable to disable Java in web browsers may be able to help mitigate these and other Java vulnerabilities by restricting access to Java applets [using a web proxy](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2012/11/do-devs-care-about-java-insecurity.html?showComment=1353874245992#c4794680666510382012). Most web proxies have features that can be used to block or whitelist requests for `.jar` and `.class` files based on network location. Filtering requests that contain a Java User-Agent header may also be effective. For environments where Java is required on the local intranet, the proxy can be configured to allow access to Java applets hosted locally, but block access to Java applets on the internet.
