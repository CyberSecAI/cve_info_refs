  "CVE-2013-0431": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability exists within the JMX (Java Management Extensions) component of Oracle Java SE 7, specifically in how the Introspector class handles JMX data. This flaw stems from an insecure call to the invoke method of java.lang.reflect.Method, allowing access to methods of restricted classes. It's identified as 'Issue 52' by Security Explorations, which discovered it.",
    "Root cause": "Insecure call to the invoke method of java.lang.reflect.Method class within the com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.Introspector class, leading to the possibility of calling no-argument methods on arbitrary objects or classes.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure method invocation",
      "Insufficient access control checks",
      "Missing package access checks in JMX Introspector"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can bypass the Java security sandbox, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Java Virtual Machine process. This bypass could allow for actions like accessing methods of restricted classes, leading to full compromise, as well as gaining access to sensitive data or modifying system configurations.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation via untrusted Java applets",
      "Exploitation via untrusted Java Web Start applications",
       "Supply data to APIs in the specified Component"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to trick a user into loading a malicious Java applet or launch a specially crafted Java Web Start application. This could be through social engineering to get users to visit malicious websites or download malicious JNLP files. An attacker could also compromise a legitimate website to host the malicious applet."
