Subject: Xen Security Advisory 34 (CVE-2013-0151) - nested virtualization
 on 32-bit exposes host crash

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-0151 / XSA-34
                            version 2

	   nested virtualization on 32-bit exposes host crash

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When performing nested virtualisation Xen would incorrectly map guest
pages for extended periods using an interface which is only intended
for transient mappings. In some configurations there are a limited
number of slots available for these transient mappings and exhausting
them leads to a host crash and therefore a Denial of Service attack.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can, by enabling nested virtualisation
from within the guest, trigger the issue.

Their ability to do this will depend on the number of VCPUs the domain
is configured with. Domains with smaller numbers of VCPUs (e.g. less
than 16) are not able to create sufficient mappings via this method to
trigger the issue.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

32 bit hypervisors running HVM guests on either Intel or AMD are
vulnerable.

Only Xen version 4.2.x is vulnerable.

Nested virtualisation was introduced as an experimental feature in Xen
4.2 and therefore versions of Xen prior to that are not vulnerable.

The 32 bit hypervisor has been removed in Xen unstable and therefore
is not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Running a 64 bit hypervisor or avoiding running HVM guests with
untrusted administrators can avoid the issue.

We strongly recommend running a 64 bit hypervisor on any processor
which supports it. Note that this does not require running a 64 bit
domain 0.

Ensuring that HVM guests with untrusted administrators do not have
more than 16 VCPUs will also avoid the issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

The attached patch avoids this issue by disabling nested HVM support
when running a 32-bit hypervisor.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```
