Subject: Re-evaluating expat/libxml2 CVE assignments

Various CVEs were assigned to XML-related issues in expat and libxml2
at:

<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/22/3>

CVE-2013-0338 - libxml2 internal entity expansion

CVE-2013-0339 - libxml2 external entities expansion

CVE-2013-0340 - expat internal entity expansion

CVE-2013-0341 - expat external entities expansion

As I noted in <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/21/24>, for
novel situations such as these, sometimes we might change directions after
we learn more.

After some investigation, the MITRE CNA team believes we should probably
REJECT CVE-2013-0341 and shift responsibility to application developers.

For CVE-2013-0340 and CVE-2013-0339, there are "workarounds" available for
application developers, although such workarounds may be very expensive to
develop, and this might place "too much" responsibility to the developers
- so, these assignments may still be OK.  It is still worth discussion.

CVE-2013-0338 still seems OK as is.

CVE-2013-0341 - expat external entities expansion
-------------------------------------------------

In <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/23/1>, Kurt says "I
think it's common enough to warrant [assignment]," but Florian Weimer
points out that expat doesn't resolve external entities directly.
Instead - as described (or quoted?) in detail by Kurt - "Expat does
not read or parse external entities directly."  The developer using
expat has to explicitly set ExternalEntityRefHandler, then create "a
subsidiary parser with XML_ExternalEntityParserCreate".

Since the programmer using expat has to do the work to define and set
up their ExternalEntityRefHandler, we believe that means that
individual applications are using expat unsafely, so there should be
separate CVEs for the applications, not expat.

CVE-2013-0340 - expat internal entity expansion
-----------------------------------------------

This probably qualifies for a CVE, but note that the issue came up in
CVE-2009-1955 (expat as used in Apache APR-util).  The implemented
solution was to change the application, not expat. See

<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=781403>
<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/apr/apr/trunk/xml/apr_xml.c?r1=757729&r2=781403&pathrev=781403&diff_format=h>

Apparently, if an application wishes to address this issue, it has to
call the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function with the name of an
alternative function that can handle entities more safely. The
opportunity to write your own code to process entities is probably
outside the general intention of our "the library provides an API
mechanism through which safe operation can be achieved" condition as
presented in the <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/21/24>
post.

CVE-2013-0339 - libxml2 external entities expansion
---------------------------------------------------

This also probably qualifies for a CVE. This may be another situation
where the library provides the opportunity to write your own code to
process entities safely. The libxml2 documentation for
xmlSAX2ResolveEntity says "The entity loader, to control the loading
of external entities, the application can either: ... override this
xmlSAX2ResolveEntity() callback in the SAX block ... or better use the
xmlSetExternalEntityLoader() function to set up it's own entity
resolution routine." If so, then like CVE-2013-0340, it again would
arguably be outside the bounds of the "the library provides an API
mechanism through which safe operation can be achieved" condition.

# Expat: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-21**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Expat, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/expat** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.0-r1** |

### Background

Expat is a set of XML parsing libraries.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Expat. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to process a specially crafted XML
file, could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or
cause a Denial of Service condition. This attack could also be used
against automated systems that arbitrarily process XML files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Expat users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/expat-2.2.0-r1"

```

Message-ID: <512705C8.6080908@redhat.com>

Subject: CVEs for libxml2 and expat internal and external XML entity expansion

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

So here are the CVE's for the two big ones, libxml2 and expat. Both
are affected by the expansion of internal entities (which can be used
to consume resources) and external entities (which can cause a denial
of service against other services, be used to port scan, etc.).

To be clear:

====================
Internal entity expansion refers to the exponential/quadratic/fast
linear expansion of XML entities, e.g.:
====================
<!DOCTYPE xmlbomb [
<!ENTITY a "1234567890" >
<!ENTITY b "&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;">
<!ENTITY c "&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;">
<!ENTITY d "&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;">
]>
<bomb>&d;</bomb>

or

<!DOCTYPE bomb [
<!ENTITY a "xxxxxxx... a couple of ten thousand chars">
]>
<bomb>&a;&a;&a;... repeat</bomb>

Which causes resources to be consumed

====================
External entity expansion refers to the loading of external resources
such as XML entities from another server or a local file:
====================
<!DOCTYPE external [
<!ENTITY ee SYSTEM "<http://www.example.org/some.xml>">
]>
<root>&ee;</root>

<!DOCTYPE external [
<!ENTITY ee SYSTEM "file:///PATH/TO/simple.xml">
]>
<root>&ee;</root>

Which can cause resources to be consumed or can result in port
scanning /application scanning information being sent to the attacker.

So the CVE's to use:

Please use CVE-2013-0338 for libxml2 internal entity expansion

Please use CVE-2013-0339 for libxml2 external entities expansion

Please use CVE-2013-0340 for expat internal entity expansion

Please use CVE-2013-0341 for expat external entities expansion

If you know of other XML libraries that are vulnerable (and open
source =) please let oss-sec know so we can assign CVEs.
