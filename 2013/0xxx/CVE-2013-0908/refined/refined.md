The provided content is related to CVE-2013-0908.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect handling of bindings for extension processes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of bindings within extension processes. This suggests an issue with how permissions or access control is managed for extensions, potentially allowing an extension to access resources it should not be able to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is not explicitly stated but could lead to unauthorized access to data or system resources, privilege escalation within the browser or even the ability to execute malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector would involve a malicious or compromised extension that exploits the incorrect handling of bindings, leveraging it to perform actions that are outside of the permitted scope.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to create or compromise an existing Chrome extension and then be able to exploit the vulnerability from within that extension. The attacker would need the ability to install or have installed, a vulnerable extension.
