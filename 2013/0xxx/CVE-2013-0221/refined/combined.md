| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=903464#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-24 03:46:38 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the sort command suffered from a segfault when processing input streams that contained extremely long strings when used with the -d and -M switches.  This flaw is due to the inclusion of the coreutils-i18n.patch.  SUSE has fixed this by fixing the patch.  The changes can be seen here [2].  (There is probably e better place to get the patch, but I don't know where).  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=798538> [2] <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/149348#diff_headline_coreutils-i18n-patch_diff_action_0_submit_0_19>   Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=903464#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-24 03:54:22 UTC  ``` Created coreutils tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 903468](show_bug.cgi?id=903468 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2013-0221 CVE-2013-0222 CVE-2013-0223 coreutils various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=903464#c2)  Ondrej Vasik    2013-01-24 15:58:04 UTC  ``` Thanks Vincent, but fedora-all is not really true, I already fixed the issue in Rawhide...   - fix multiple segmantation faults in i18n patch (by SUSE) (#869442, #902917)  Should I just close the bugzillas reported by you as duplicates of #902917/#869442 ?  Btw. all RHELs are affected as well, they use the vulnerable alloca constructs as well...   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=903464#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-29 23:30:04 UTC  ``` Well, we're not as concerned with Rawhide as we are with released versions.  So unless it's fixed in Fedora 17 and 18, the fedora-all tracker should remain open.  Once they are fixed there, feel free to close it via the regular process.  For RHEL, we know they are affected.  See #c0's statement regarding how we are deferring the fix (low-impact flaw).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=903464#c4)  Fedora Update System    2013-02-01 16:28:04 UTC  ``` coreutils-8.17-8.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=903464#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-21 20:59:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1652 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1652.html>   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Low: coreutils security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1652)

## Topic

Updated coreutils packages that fix three security issues, several bugs,
and add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The coreutils package contains the core GNU utilities. It is a combination
of the old GNU fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils packages.

It was discovered that the sort, uniq, and join utilities did not properly
restrict the use of the alloca() function. An attacker could use this flaw
to crash those utilities by providing long input strings. (CVE-2013-0221,
CVE-2013-0222, CVE-2013-0223)

These updated coreutils packages include numerous bug fixes and two
enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Technical
Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
of these changes.

All coreutils users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=903465#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-24 03:49:52 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the uniq command suffered from a segfault when processing input streams that contained extremely long strings.  This flaw is due to the inclusion of the coreutils-i18n.patch.  SUSE has fixed this by fixing the patch.  The changes can be seen here [2].  (There is probably e better place to get the patch, but I don't know where).  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=796243> [2] <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/149348#diff_headline_coreutils-i18n-patch_diff_action_0_submit_0_19>   Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=903465#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-24 03:54:38 UTC  ``` Created coreutils tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 903468](show_bug.cgi?id=903468 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2013-0221 CVE-2013-0222 CVE-2013-0223 coreutils various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=903465#c2)  Ondrej Vasik    2013-01-24 15:59:04 UTC  ``` Thanks Vincent, but fedora-all is not really true, I already fixed the issue in Rawhide... coreutils-8.20-6.fc19 - fix multiple segmantation faults in i18n patch (by SUSE) (#869442, #902917)  Should I just close the bugzillas reported by you as duplicates of #902917/#869442 ?  Btw. all RHELs are affected as well, they use the vulnerable alloca constructs as well...   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=903465#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-29 23:30:39 UTC  ``` Well, we're not as concerned with Rawhide as we are with released versions.  So unless it's fixed in Fedora 17 and 18, the fedora-all tracker should remain open.  Once they are fixed there, feel free to close it via the regular process.  For RHEL, we know they are affected.  See #c0's statement regarding how we are deferring the fix (low-impact flaw).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=903465#c4)  Fedora Update System    2013-02-01 16:28:13 UTC  ``` coreutils-8.17-8.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

To see if this suggested fix has the same effect, then we need to decide if the effect is desirable.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=980061#c2)  Ondrej Vasik    2013-07-01 11:58:33 UTC  ``` Thanks for suggestion, I'll check if this is acceptable with upstream.

When the destination directory exists and has contents the source directory merges the directories clobbering existing files.  E.g. f18# cp /etc/group /test f18# vi /test/passwd f18# mkdir /home/test f18# cp /etc/passwd /home/test f18# ls -l /home/test /test /home/test: total 4 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2768 Jul  1 12:54 passwd  /test: total 8 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1162 Jul  1 12:53 group -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2781 Jul  1 12:54 passwd f18# /home/ken/git/fedora/coreutils/src/mv /home/test / f18# ls -l /home/test /test ls: cannot access /home/test: No such file or directory /test: total 8 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1162 Jul  1 12:53 group -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2768 Jul  1 12:54 passwd  Now, the question is. Do we want to accept this behaviour as correct for Linux?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=980061#c4)  Ondrej Vasik    2013-07-01 12:17:39 UTC  ``` Not unlike with upstream - so this should be discussed at bug-coreutils or coreutils - if you want to bring it up there, feel free to do so, otherwise I will raise this question myself - hopefully later this week. Still,   I think it is not something what should be changed in released RHEL, as it may bring in some nasty consequences for the people who rely on current behaviour.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=980061#c5)  Ken Booth    2013-07-01 20:31:13 UTC  ``` Final draft for proposed changes is as follows:  src/copy.c 2176c2176 <       if (unlink (dst_name) != 0 && errno != ENOENT) --- >       if (unlink (dst_name) != 0 && errno != ENOENT && errno != EISDIR) 2267,2269c2267,2278 <               error (0, errno, _("cannot create directory %s"), <                      quote (dst_name)); <               goto un_backup; --- >               if (errno == EEXIST) >                 { >                   if (lchmod (dst_name, dst_mode & ~omitted_permissions) != 0) >                     { >                       error (0, errno, _("setting permissions for %s"), >                              quote (dst_name)); >                     } >                 } else { >                   error (0, errno, _("cannot create directory %s"), >                          quote (dst_name)); >                   goto un_backup; >                 }  Completed various tests and this appears to achieve the desired effect.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=980061#c6)  Eric Blake    2013-07-01 22:28:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ken Booth from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=980061#c5)) > Final draft for proposed changes is as follows: >  > src/copy.c > 2176c2176 > <       if (unlink (dst_name) != 0 && errno != ENOENT) > --- > >       if (unlink (dst_name) != 0 && errno != ENOENT && errno != EISDIR)  Ed script patches are illegible.

Ah, but my solution ([comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=980061#c7)) is loosey-goosey when mixing a source file with destination directory, or source directory with destination file; your patch is closer to actual rename() semantics which is what POSIX requires.  At any rate, we'll see what upstream coreutils does about the issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=980061#c11)  Ondrej Vasik    2013-07-08 08:43:32 UTC  ``` Pointer to upstream discussion: <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=14763> ... atm. it seems only Ken and Eric discussed the item.
