{
  "cveId": "CVE-2013-0221",
  "related": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to the inclusion of the coreutils-i18n.patch, specifically the usage of the `alloca()` function without proper restrictions in the `sort` command.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `sort` command does not properly restrict the use of the `alloca()` function.",
       "Insufficient input validation when processing long strings in `sort` with the `-d` and `-M` switches."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could cause a segmentation fault (segfault), leading to a denial of service by providing long input strings to the vulnerable `sort` command.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Exploiting the `sort` command with the `-d` or `-M` options by providing extremely long strings in the input stream."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply input to the sort utility. This could be through a file, pipe, or other input method.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `sort` command is used with the `-d` or `-M` switches while processing input streams containing extremely long strings. The `coreutils-i18n.patch` is identified as the source of the flaw."
