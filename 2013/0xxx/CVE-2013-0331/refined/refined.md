Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0331:

**Root Cause:**
- A vulnerability in Jenkins allows a malicious user to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. This is achieved by providing a specially crafted payload to the Jenkins application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core weakness is the insufficient handling of a specific input or payload by Jenkins. This lack of proper input validation or resource management allows the attacker to exhaust resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition. This means that the Jenkins service becomes unavailable or unresponsive, disrupting its intended functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a malicious user who has write access to the Jenkins instance. This implies that the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with some level of privilege to interact with Jenkins and submit the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a valid user of Jenkins with write access. This means that the attacker needs a valid account and permissions within the Jenkins system to be able to craft and send malicious requests that lead to a denial of service.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity, as it requires a valid user with write access and does not cause privilege escalation or data loss.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Jenkins versions 1.502 (mainline) and 1.480.3 (LTS).
- The vulnerability was addressed as part of a larger security advisory that also fixed other vulnerabilities, such as CSRF and XSS issues.
- This vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.2 via RHSA-2013:0638.
