- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation when processing specially crafted packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The devices do not properly validate the input received via the specified ports.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sending specifically crafted packets to port 102/tcp (ISO-TSAP) causes the device to go into a defect mode, which results in a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted network packets to TCP port 102.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device. No prior authentication is required, and it can be done remotely over the network.
