Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2013-0805:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The iTop web application's search feature displayed user-entered terms without proper encoding. The implemented mitigation, which only encoded `<` within a script tag, was inadequate and easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper encoding of user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows an attacker to inject malicious code (HTML or client-side scripts) into the web page viewed by other users.
- Enables impersonation of logged-in iTop users.
- Could potentially lead to phishing attacks and browser exploits.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation of the iTop search functionality, by inserting malicious code within the search query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a search query to the vulnerable iTop web application.
- No authentication is explicitly needed to trigger the vulnerability, though exploitation could lead to the impersonation of logged-in users.

**Additional details:**
- Affected iTop versions: all versions older than trunk revision 2589, branches/1.2.1 revision 2587, branches/1.2 revision 2588, and branches/2.0 revision 2590.
- Patches were committed to SourceForge Trac by the vendor, and the affected files are `pages/UI.php` and `pages/run_query.php`.
- The fix involves thoroughly encoding all user input on output.
- The vulnerability was discovered on January 4th, 2013, and the advisory was publicly released on January 23rd, 2013.
