    "CVE": "CVE-2013-0216",
    "description": "The Xen netback implementation contains a couple of flaws which can allow a guest to cause a DoS in the backend domain, potentially affecting other domains in the system.\nCVE-2013-0216 is a failure to sanity check the ring producer/consumer pointers which can allow a guest to cause netback to loop for an extended period preventing other work from occurring.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Xen netback"

    "root_cause": "Failure to sanitize ring producer/consumer pointers in the Xen netback implementation.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unchecked ring producer/consumer pointers leading to potential infinite loops.",

    "impact": "A malicious guest can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) in the backend domain, potentially affecting other domains in the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious guest with access to PV network devices can trigger the vulnerability by providing crafted ring producer/consumer pointers."

     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered due to a lack of validation of ring producer/consumer pointers, which allows a malicious guest to cause netback to loop for an extended period, preventing other work from occurring."
