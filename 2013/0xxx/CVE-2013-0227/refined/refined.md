Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-0227

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The provided text does not explicitly state the root cause, but it mentions the vulnerability type as XSS.  The context is the "Search API sorts" module for Drupal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The module suffers from a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This implies that the module is not properly sanitizing user-supplied data before rendering it in a web page.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application. When a user views the affected page, this malicious code will be executed within their browser. The impact ranges from minor annoyances to severe compromises, such as:

*   Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   Modifying page content and defacing the website.
*   Potentially executing code on the user's machine if combined with further browser-based exploits.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Search API sorts" module in Drupal. An attacker would likely need to inject the malicious code through a search query or sort parameter, which will later be displayed without proper sanitization to other users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to provide input to the search or sort functionality of the vulnerable Drupal module. This could be through direct interaction with the search/sort interface or by crafting a malicious URL containing the payload.
