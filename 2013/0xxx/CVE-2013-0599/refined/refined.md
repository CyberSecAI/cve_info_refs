- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A parameter path to the Rational Directory Server help documentation causes an error message response from the server. This error message includes HTTP ERROR 500 debug information, which is displayed in the browser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the exposure of debugging information (HTTP ERROR 500) when accessing specific help documentation paths. This likely exposes internal system details through improperly handled error conditions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain information about the server environment through the exposed debug information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted request to the help documentation path, causing an error which reveals debug information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected server, implying network access. No other specific capabilities are mentioned.
