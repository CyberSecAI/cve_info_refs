   `<RDS\RDA install location>\WebAccessServer\apache-tomcat-x.0.xx\webapps`

   UNIX / Linux:

   `<RDS/RDA install location>/WebAccessServer/apache-tomcat-x.0.xx/webapps`
3. Delete/backup the following:

* *file:* **rds-help.war**
* *directory:* **rds-help**

5. Replace with the *rds-help.war* download.
6. Start the WebAccessServer

   Windows:
