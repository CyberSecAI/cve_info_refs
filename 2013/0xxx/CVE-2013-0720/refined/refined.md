Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an issue in the access permissions for certain files within the COBIME application. This means the application is not properly protecting sensitive data by controlling access to specific files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control/permissions.
- Information disclosure due to the ability of other apps to access the improperly protected files

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious Android application, installed by the same user, can potentially access and disclose information managed by COBIME.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, requiring the user to have installed both the vulnerable COBIME app and a malicious app.
- A malicious third-party application running on the same Android device can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the same device as the vulnerable COBIME app.
- The attacker does not need any specific authentication, but relies on the user to install the malicious application.
- The attacker needs "some expertise" to carry out the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v2 score of 2.6, indicating low severity. This is primarily because a high access complexity and a requirement that a user installs a malicious application are involved.
- The vulnerability was reported by Gaku Mochizuki of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
- The fix is to update the COBIME software to version 0.9.4 or later.
