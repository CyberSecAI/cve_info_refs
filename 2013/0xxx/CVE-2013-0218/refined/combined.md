RHSA-2013:0206 - Security Advisory

Issued:

Updated:
2013-01-30
# RHSA-2013:0206 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Low: JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Topic

An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one
security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,
which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
JBoss Seam.

The GUI installer created a world-readable auto-install XML file containing
both the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform administrator password and
the sucker password for the selected messaging system in plain text. A
local user able to access the directory where the GUI installer for JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 was run could use this flaw to gain
administrative access to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
instance. (CVE-2013-0218)

Note: This update provides the initial release of the GUI installer for
version 5.2.0. Users continuing to use the 5.1.2 installer will remain
vulnerable to this issue.

This issue was discovered by Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security
Response Team.

Users requiring the GUI installer for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
5.2.0 are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update).

## Affected Products

* JBoss Enterprise Application Platform from RHUI 5 x86\_64
* JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 for RHEL 6 x86\_64

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-04 19:16:50 UTC  ``` A flaw in how TLS/DTLS, when CBC-mode encryption is used, communicates was reported.  This vulnerability can allow for a Man-in-the-Middle attacker to recover plaintext from a TLS/DTLS connection, when CBC-mode encryption is used.  This flaw is in the TLS specification, and not a bug in a specific implementation (as such, it affects nearly all implementations).  As such, it affects all TLS and DTLS implementations that are compliant with TLS 1.1 or 1.2, or with DTLS 1.0 or 1.2.  It also applies to implementations of SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 that incorporate countermeasures to deal with previous padding oracle attacks.  All TLS/DTLS ciphersuites that include CBC-mode encryption are potentially vulnerable.  The paper indicates that with OpenSSL, a full plaintext recovery attack is possible, and with GnuTLS, a partial plaintext recovery is possible (recovering up to 4 bits of the last byte in any block of plaintext).  To perform a successful attack, when TLS is used, a large number of TLS sessions are required (target plaintext must be sent repeatedly in the same position in the plaintext stream across the sessions).  For DTLS, a successful attack can be carried out in a single session.  The attacker must also be located close to the machine being attacked.  Further details are noted in the paper.  Current status of fixes in various implementations:  * OpenSSL has a patch in development * NSS has a patch in development * GnuTLS is fixed in versions 2.12.23, 3.0.28, and 3.1.7 * PolarSSL is fixed in version 1.2.5 * BouncyCastle has a patch that will be included in the forthcoming 1.48 version  Full paper:  <http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf>  External References:  <http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/> <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20130205.txt> <https://polarssl.org/tech-updates/releases/polarssl-1.2.5-released>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-05 07:12:06 UTC  ``` GnuTLS advisory GNUTLS-SA-2013-1:  <http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2013-1>  GnuTLS fix:  2.12.x: <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/458c67cf98740e7b12404f6c30e0d5317d56fd30> <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/93b7fcfa3297a9123630704668b2946f602b910e>  3.0.x: <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/8dc2822966f64dd9cf7dde9c7aacd80d49d3ffe5>  3.2.x / master: <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/328ee22c1b3951e060c7124c7cb1cee592c59bc0>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c2)  Huzaifa S.

Namely, we are stuck with version 1.46 because the later version (1.47) comes with backward incompatible API changes. This affects the dependent libraries, in particular itext. Unfortunately we are also stuck with itext-2.1.7 because the next version series (itext-5.*) was vetoed by FE-Legal.   Note that I do not maintain bouncycastle any more. I dropped my maintainership last August after an announcement in the Fedora-devel mailing list. To my knowledge no one picked it up yet, which makes me wonder why this bug CCd me. I can still provide some help though if you can supply a patch. If you provide a patch for bouncycastle-1.46 we can get around this problem.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c8)  Huzaifa S.

RHSA-2013:0207 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2013-01-30
Updated:
2013-01-30
# RHSA-2013:0207 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Low: JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Topic

An update for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one security
issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The Enterprise Web Platform is a slimmed down profile of the JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform intended for mid-size workloads with light
and rich Java applications.

The GUI installer created a world-readable auto-install XML file containing
both the JBoss Enterprise Web Platform administrator password and the
sucker password for the selected messaging system in plain text. A local
user able to access the directory where the GUI installer for JBoss
Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2 was run could use this flaw to gain
administrative access to the JBoss Enterprise Web Platform instance.
(CVE-2013-0218)

Note: This update provides the initial release of the GUI installer for
version 5.2.0. Users continuing to use the 5.1.2 installer will remain
vulnerable to this issue.

This issue was discovered by Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security
Response Team.

Users requiring the GUI installer for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0
are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update).

RHSA-2013:0833 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2013:0833 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0, which fixes multiple security
issues, various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red
Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications
based on JBoss Application Server 7.

This release serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application
Platform 6.0.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the 6.1.0
Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes,
available shortly from <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/>

Security fixes:

XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. (CVE-2012-5575)

Note: Automatic checks to prevent CVE-2012-5575 are only run when
WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security requirements. It is best
practice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce security requirements.

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the OCSP response verification
in OpenSSL. A malicious OCSP server could use this flaw to crash
applications performing OCSP verification by sending a specially-crafted
response. (CVE-2013-0166)

It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting
TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
padding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)

When applications running on JBoss Web used the COOKIE session tracking
method, the org.apache.catalina.connector.Response.encodeURL() method
returned the URL with the jsessionid appended as a query string parameter
when processing the first request of a session. An attacker could possibly
exploit this flaw by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to obtain a
user's jsessionid and hijack their session, or by extracting the jsessionid
from log files. Note that no session tracking method is used by default,
one must be configured. (CVE-2012-4529)

If multiple applications used the same custom authorization module class
name, and provided their own implementations of it, the first application
to be loaded will have its implementation used for all other applications
using the same custom authorization module class name. A local attacker
could use this flaw to deploy a malicious application that provides
implementations of custom authorization modules that permit or deny user
access according to rules supplied by the attacker. (CVE-2012-4572)

The GUI installer created a world-readable auto-install XML file containing
both the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform administrator password and
the sucker password for the selected messaging system in plain text. A
local user able to access the directory where the GUI installer was run
could use this flaw to gain administrative access to the JBoss Enterprise
Application Platform instance. (CVE-2013-0218)

Red Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj
Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575.
CVE-2012-4572 was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss EAP
Quality Engineering team, and CVE-2013-0218 was discovered by Arun
Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

Users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 as provided from the
Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise
Application Platform 6.1.0.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying this update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed
applications.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=903073#c0)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2013-01-23 05:02:05 UTC  ``` The JBoss EAP/EWP 5.2.0 GUI installer can generate an auto-install XML file that contains the admin/sucker password in plain text. This file when saved on disk is set as being world-readable. This means any local user can view the password which could then be used to gain administrator access to an EAP/EWP instance.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=903073#c2)  David Jorm    2013-01-29 03:06:05 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=903073#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-30 21:08:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0  Via RHSA-2013:0207 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0207.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=903073#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-30 21:09:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0  Via RHSA-2013:0206 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0206.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=903073#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-05-20 14:32:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2013:0833 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0833.html>   ``` |  |
