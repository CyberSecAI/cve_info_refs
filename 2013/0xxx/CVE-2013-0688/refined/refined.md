Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

*   **Root Cause:** The Invensys Wonderware Information Server (WIS) software fails to properly neutralize user-supplied input when generating web pages, allowing an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser.
    *   Bypass client-side security mechanisms.
    *   Potentially perform actions on behalf of the user (if combined with social engineering).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Injection of malicious client-side script into web pages viewed by other users. This is a remote attack vector, meaning the attacker doesn't need local access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject the malicious script into the application's web pages. The attack requires a medium skill level to execute.
