Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-0481:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Errors or exceptions encountered in IBM Sterling B2B Integrator's console processing can result in stack traces being displayed in the response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of errors during console processing, which leads to the exposure of internal implementation details via stack traces.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exposure of stack traces can reveal internal implementation information, which could potentially aid an attacker in further attacks by providing insights into the system's architecture and potential vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when errors occur during console processing, likely through user interaction or specific requests to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to interact with the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator console in a way that can trigger errors or exceptions, causing the vulnerable stack traces to be displayed.  An authenticated user could possibly trigger this.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   IBM Sterling B2B Integrator 5.2, 5.1 and 5.0
*   IBM Sterling File Gateway 2.2, 2.1 and 2.0

**Remediation:**
*   Apply fix pack 5104 if you are running Sterling Integrator 5.1 or Sterling File Gateway 2.1.
*   Apply iFix 5020401\_3 or apply Fix Pack 5020402 if you are running Sterling B2B Integrator 5.2 or Sterling File Gateway 2.2
*   Apply FixPack 5010, if you are running Sterling Integrator 5.0 or Sterling File Gateway 2.0
