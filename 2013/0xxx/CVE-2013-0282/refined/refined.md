Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0282:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Keystone's EC2-style authentication mechanism. Specifically, Keystone does not verify if a user, tenant, or domain is enabled before authenticating a user through the EC2 API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The core issue is the absence of a check to ensure that users, tenants, and domains are in an enabled state before granting access.
*   **Inconsistent Authentication Logic**: EC2-style authentication did not use the same checks as token-based authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Exploitation allows disabled users, or users in disabled tenants or domains, to retain access rights. This means that even after an administrator attempts to revoke access by disabling a user or tenant, an attacker can continue to operate with the user's previous authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **EC2 API Authentication:** The attack vector involves using the EC2 API authentication method with a disabled user, a user in a disabled tenant, or a user in a disabled domain.
*   **Exploitation of Existing Credentials:** An attacker needs valid EC2 API credentials for a disabled user, or a user within a disabled tenant/domain, to successfully exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid EC2 Credentials:** The attacker must have access to valid EC2 credentials that belong to a disabled user, or a user in a disabled tenant/domain.
*   **Knowledge of EC2 API:** The attacker needs to know how to use the EC2 API to authenticate.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of OpenStack Keystone are affected.
*   **Workaround:** The issue can be mitigated by disabling the EC2 extension by removing `keystone.contrib.ec2:Ec2Extension.factory` from the keystone API pipeline in `keystone.conf`.
*   **Fix:** Patches have been released for Grizzly, Folsom, and Essex versions of OpenStack Keystone.
*   **Credit:** The vulnerability was reported by Nathanael Burton of the National Security Agency.
