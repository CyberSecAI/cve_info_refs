### Bug Description

Keystone does not check whether a user, tenant, or domain is enabled before authenticating a user using the EC2 api. I've attached three patches based on Grizzly (master), stable/folsom, and stable/essex. For the Grizzly patch, I've refactored the code to ensure the same checks used in token-based auth are checked when using EC2 signature-based auth.

Nit on the grizzly patch: change the reference to "token.core.validate\_auth\_info" to just "token.validate\_auth\_info". The "core" module is only referenced directly from within the token package itself.

Although the grizzly patch is primarily a refactor, I'd be happy to argue that it's totally appropriate here as a security fix: the security vulnerability is ultimately that two code paths are not sharing code, when they should be.

On the folsom and essex patches, remove the msg from being passed to Unauthorized (only use it for logging), as you're actually creating a new security vulnerability there which we are protected from in Grizzly (unnecessarily exposing the reason for auth failure to the API). In Grizzly, the msg passed to exceptions.Unauthorized() is exposed to the API in debug mode, but suppressed otherwise. We don't have that feature in essex/folsom, so we can't allow the exception's message to be overridden.

I can update the patches and post them to this bug later this evening. For stable/essex and stable/folsom, it looks like I should also fix the message being passed to exception.Unauthorized in the role check:

if not roles:

            raise exception.Unauthorized(message='User not valid for tenant.')

Hrm, I'd support that, but it's up to ttx. In this specific example, you could make the same call without a tenant to verify that authentication is succeeding, but then the only possibility for raising a 401 is that you're not authorized on the specified tenant... so I don't see any unnecessary exposure. However, I'd +1 for correcting it as part of this patch (I'd rather be on the safe side); it's not an issue worth distinctly tracking, IMO. Here's the line referenced above:

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/stable/essex/keystone/contrib/ec2/core.py#L173>

Looking through the same code, there's two other 401's that should really be 400's. There's also this:

<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/stable/essex/keystone/contrib/ec2/core.py#L115>

... which I'm not sure represents an exposure or not. I'm guessing not, because either the auth will succeed or fail there without any granularity.

I attached three new patch files for grizzly, stable/folsom, and stable/essex. I updated two 401s (Unauthorized) to 400s (ValidationError). I also removed the messages being passed to the exceptions in folsom and essex based on your feedback.

+1 all around, except I'd rather not change the status codes from 401 -> 400 in essex & folsom, even though 400 is obviously more appropriate. I'd prefer to change it in grizzly, but perhaps that change would be more appropriate as a public followup to this security fix. I'm happy to see the message argument removed from those exceptions, however.

I imagine the Grizzly patch will also conflict with <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/21487/>

@gyee, can you ensure that your approach is compatible with the refactoring here / reusable by ec2, without including the security fix in your patch?

I'll need another +1 on that. FWIW the security patch will probably get merged after gyee's patch, due to the disclosure delay... so assuming that one will and first is probably good.

Working on impact description now.

Proposed description:

----------------

Title: Keystone EC2-style authentication accepts disabled user/tenants

Reporter: $CREDIT

Products: Keystone

Affects: All versions

Description:

$CREDIT reported a vulnerability in EC2-style authentication in Keystone. Keystone fails to check whether a user, tenant, or domain is enabled before authenticating a user using the EC2 api. Authenticated, but disabled users (or authenticated users in disabled tenants or domains) could therefore retain access rights that were thought removed. Only setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected.

---------------

@mathrock: what do you want to appear in $CREDIT ?

@Keystone-core: Is it even possible to disable EC2-style auth to workaround this issue? If yes, how?

Updated description:

--------------------------------------

Title: Keystone EC2-style authentication accepts disabled user/tenants

Reporter: Nathanael Burton (National Security Agency)

Products: Keystone

Affects: All versions

Description:

Nathanael Burton reported a vulnerability in EC2-style authentication in Keystone. Keystone fails to check whether a user, tenant, or domain is enabled before authenticating a user using the EC2 api. Authenticated, but disabled users (or authenticated users in disabled tenants or domains) could therefore retain access rights that were thought removed. Only setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected. To disable EC2-style authentication to work around the issue, remove the ec2\_extension from the keystone API pipeline in keystone.conf.

-----------------------------------------

Proposed release date: Tuesday, February 19 at 1500 UTC

On the patches, what name/email should be used as the author of the code when the time comes to merge them? If you want, you have this pre-set by exporting them from your local git tree using "git format-patch". This format will preserve the commit message, as well. Otherwise we can fill it in.

Subject: [OSSA 2013-005] Keystone EC2-style authentication accepts disabled
 user/tenants (CVE-2013-0282)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-005
CVE: CVE-2013-0282
Date: February 19, 2013
Keystone EC2-style authentication accepts disabled user/tenants
Reporter: Nathanael Burton (National Security Agency)
Products: Keystone
Affects: All versions

Description:
Nathanael Burton reported a vulnerability in EC2-style authentication in
Keystone. Keystone fails to check whether a user, tenant, or domain is
enabled before authenticating a user using the EC2 api. Authenticated,
but disabled users (or authenticated users in disabled tenants or
domains) could therefore retain access rights that were thought removed.
Only setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected. To disable
EC2-style authentication to work around the issue, remove the EC2
extension (keystone.contrib.ec2:Ec2Extension.factory) from the keystone
API pipeline in keystone.conf.

Grizzly (development branch) fix:
