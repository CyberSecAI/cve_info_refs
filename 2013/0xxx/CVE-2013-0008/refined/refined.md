Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-0008:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) improperly handling window broadcast messages. Specifically, it fails to properly validate or sanitize these messages before processing them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Message Handling:** The core issue is the incorrect processing of window broadcast messages within the kernel-mode driver. This allows for manipulation of how these messages are handled.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to elevate their privileges on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can gain higher privileges, potentially up to system-level control.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a higher Integrity Level (IL) process.
- **Full System Control:** With administrative rights, an attacker can take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker must convince a user to run a specially crafted application that sends malicious window broadcast messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the target system.
- **Ability to Run Programs:** The attacker needs the ability to execute programs on the target system.
- **Social Engineering or Similar:** The attacker needs a way to get the user to execute their malicious application. This could involve social engineering or other methods to trick the user into running the malicious code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects various Windows versions including Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT.
- The provided exploit code uses `HWND_BROADCAST` and `WM_CHAR` to send commands to a medium IL `cmd.exe` process.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed and there were no reports of exploitation prior to the security bulletin.
