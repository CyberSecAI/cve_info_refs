```
-added option to supply name of reservation to XMLRPCdeployServer
-XMLRPCremoveUserGroup and XMLRPCdeleteUserGroup did the same thing; made XMLRPCdeleteUserGroup just call XMLRPCremoveUserGroup - kept both so that scripts would not have to change because one was dropped
-did some updates to headers to provide better documentation generation
-changed some whitespace formatting
-modified XMLRPCgetRequestIds - added OS, isserver, state, and if it is a server, servername to returned data-modified XMLRPCgetUserGroupAttributes - added overlapResCount to returned data; modified error return code to not be duplicated with an different error
-modified XMLRPCremoveUserGroup - added ability to delete federated groups if user has access; added check for group being in use before deleting it and return error if it is in use
-modified XMLRPCeditUserGroup - added ability to modify federated groups if user has access; do not attempt to update name and affiliation if they are not changed (resulted in an duplicate group name error)
-modified XMLRPCgetUserGroupMembers - added ability to modify federated groups if user has access

privileges.php:
-additional parameter checking
-modified viewNodes - added serverProfileAdmin to $privs array used to determine which resource groups can be added at the node
-modified AJsubmitAddChildNode - moved updateUserOrGroupPrivs to inside if conditional (no need to call it if no changes)
-modified getNodeCascadePrivileges - located problem where blocking cascaded privileges does not continue to child nodes; added fix and commented it out until can properly prepare users for change

utils.php:
-modified getResourceGroups - optional argument of $id to limit returned data to just a specified resource group
-modified getUserGroupID - added optional argument of $noadd that causes the function to return NULL instead of adding the group if it does not already exist
-modified getTypes - removed conditional that checks for 'block' and 'cascade' with resource groups - type here is computer, image, etc.

groups.php:
-modified addGroup - moved conditional for editgroupid to inside 'user' section
```
