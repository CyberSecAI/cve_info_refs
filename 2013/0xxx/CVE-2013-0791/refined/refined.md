  "CVE-2013-0791": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds array read flaw was found in the way NSS decoded certain certificates. If an application using NSS decoded a malformed certificate, it could cause the application to crash.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6",
       "Oracle VM Server for x86",
       "Mozilla Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds array read vulnerability exists in the CERT_DecodeCertPackage function of the Network Security Services (NSS) library when decoding a certificate. This occurs when the function reads bytes beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.",
      "weaknesses": [
         "Out-of-bounds read"
         ],
     "impact": "An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by supplying a malformed certificate that triggers the out-of-bounds read, causing the application using NSS to crash. In some circumstances, this issue could lead to a data leak through rendered images drawing from random memory, or could lead to a denial of service-like conditions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malformed certificate"
      ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted, malformed certificate to a vulnerable application using NSS.",
      "attacker_position": "The attacker could be remote, as malformed certificates can be supplied via network protocols, but the attacker needs the ability to deliver the malformed certificate."
    },
    "additional_information": {
      "redhat_specific_details": "The vulnerability is present in the nss component of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6. Red Hat acknowledges the Mozilla project for reporting the issue, which was originally reported by Ambroz Bizjak.",
        "oracle_specific_details":"This vulnerability is present in Oracle VM Server for x86.  Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.",
        "opensuse_specific_details":"This vulnerability is present in Mozilla Firefox running on SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE. The fix requires updates to Firefox, NSS and NSPR.",
         "mozilla_specific_details": "The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 20, Firefox ESR 17.0.5, SeaMonkey 2.17, Thunderbird 17.0.5, and Thunderbird ESR 17.0.5. Mozilla community member Ambroz Bizjak reported the vulnerability. Memory corruption during PNG decoding could also occur when certain color profiles are used."
