Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-0895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect path handling during file copying within the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is related to how Chromium handles file paths when copying files. The flaw lies in the logic for processing file paths, specifically on Linux and Mac operating systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to a high-severity security issue. The specific impact is not detailed in the provided context but given its classification as "High" severity and the nature of file path manipulation issues, this could range from arbitrary file system access, overwrite of sensitive files, to possibly other more severe impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during a file copy operation. This suggests an attack vector involving actions that induce Chromium to copy files, possibly through browser interaction, scripts, or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would likely need to be able to influence the file paths used in Chromium's file copying process, which could be achieved through exploiting web browser functionalities, file download handling, or other interaction with the browser. It requires the ability to cause a file copy operation to occur on Linux or Mac platforms.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was identified and addressed by the Google Chrome Security Team (JÃ¼ri Aedla).
- The fix for this issue was included in Chrome version 25.0.1364.97 for Windows and Linux, and 25.0.1364.99 for Mac, and also addressed in a later openSUSE update, version 27.0.1425.
- The issue is specific to Linux and Mac operating systems.
