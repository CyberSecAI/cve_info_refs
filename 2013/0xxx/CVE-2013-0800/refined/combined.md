When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

                 CVE-2013-1680 CVE-2013-1681

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
missing input sanitising vulnerabilities, use-after-free vulnerabilities,
buffer overflows and other programming errors may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, information leaks or
cross-site-scripting.

We're changing the approach for security updates for Iceweasel, Icedove
and Iceape in stable-security: Instead of backporting security fixes,
we now provide releases based on the Extended Support Release branch. As
such, this update introduces packages based on Firefox 17 and at some
point in the future we will switch to the next ESR branch once ESR 17
has reached it's end of life.

Some Xul extensions currently packaged in the Debian archive are not
compatible with the new browser engine. Up-to-date and compatible
versions can be retrieved from <http://addons.mozilla.org> as a short
term solution. A solution to keep packaged extensions compatible with
the Mozilla releases is still being sorted out.

We don't have the resources to backport security fixes to the Iceweasel
release in oldstable-security any longer. If you're up to the task and
want to help, please get in touch with team@security.debian.org.
Otherwise, we'll announce the end of  security support for Iceweasel,
Icedove and Iceape in Squeeze in the next update round.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.6esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.6esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Mozilla Firefox
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2013:0850-1
Rating: important
References: #819204
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 for VMware LTSS
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 LTSS
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes four new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox has been updated to the17.0.6ESR security
version upgrade as a LTSS roll up release.
\*
MFSA 2013-30: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
Olli Pettay, Jesse Ruderman, Boris Zbarsky, Christian
Holler, Milan Sreckovic, and Joe Drew reported memory
safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 17, and
Firefox 19. (CVE-2013-0788)
\*
MFSA 2013-31 / CVE-2013-0800: Security researcher
Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team
used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover an
out-of-bounds write in Cairo graphics library. When certain
values are passed to it during rendering, Cairo attempts to
use negative boundaries or sizes for boxes, leading to a
potentially exploitable crash in some instances.
\*
MFSA 2013-32 / CVE-2013-0799: Security researcher
Frederic Hoguin discovered that the Mozilla Maintenance
Service on Windows was vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
This system is used to update software without invoking the
User Account Control (UAC) prompt. The Mozilla Maintenance
Service is configured to allow unprivileged users to start
it with arbitrary arguments. By manipulating the data
passed in these arguments, an attacker can execute
arbitrary code with the system privileges used by the
service. This issue requires local file system access to be
exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-34 / CVE-2013-0797: Security researcher Ash
reported an issue with the Mozilla Updater. The Mozilla
Updater can be made to load a malicious local DLL file in a
privileged context through either the Mozilla Maintenance
Service or independently on systems that do not use the
service. This occurs when the DLL file is placed in a
specific location on the local system before the Mozilla
Updater is run. Local file system access is necessary in
order for this issue to be exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-35 / CVE-2013-0796: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a crash
in WebGL rendering when memory is freed that has not
previously been allocated. This issue only affects Linux
users who have Intel Mesa graphics drivers. The resulting
crash could be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-36 / CVE-2013-0795: Security researcher
Cody Crews reported a mechanism to use the cloneNode method
to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW) and clone a protected
node. This allows violation of the browser's same origin
policy and could also lead to privilege escalation and the
execution of arbitrary code.
\*
MFSA 2013-37 / CVE-2013-0794: Security researcher
shutdown reported a method for removing the origin
indication on tab-modal dialog boxes in combination with
browser navigation. This could allow an attacker's dialog
to overlay a page and show another site's content. This can
be used for phishing by allowing users to enter data into a
modal prompt dialog on an attacking, site while appearing
to be from the displayed site.
\*
MFSA 2013-38 / CVE-2013-0793: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported a method to use browser
navigations through history to load an arbitrary website
with that page's baseURI property pointing to another site
instead of the seemingly loaded one. The user will continue
to see the incorrect site in the addressbar of the browser.
This allows for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or the
theft of data through a phishing attack.
\*
MFSA 2013-39 / CVE-2013-0792: Mozilla community
member Tobias Schula reported that if
gfx.color\_management.enablev4 preference is enabled
manually in about:config, some grayscale PNG images will be
rendered incorrectly and cause memory corruption during PNG
decoding when certain color profiles are in use. A crafted
PNG image could use this flaw to leak data through rendered
images drawing from random memory. By default, this
preference is not enabled.
\*
MFSA 2013-40 / CVE-2013-0791: Mozilla community
member Ambroz Bizjak reported an out-of-bounds array read
in the CERT\_DecodeCertPackage function of the Network
Security Services (NSS) libary when decoding a certificate.
When this occurs, it will lead to memory corruption and a
non-exploitable crash.

### Description

Security researcher **Abhishek Arya** (Inferno) of the Google
Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover an out-of-bounds write in Cairo graphics library. When certain values are passed to it during rendering, Cairo attempts to use negative boundaries or sizes for boxes, leading to a potentially exploitable crash in some instances.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0696)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2013-0788)

A flaw was found in the way Same Origin Wrappers were implemented in
Firefox. A malicious site could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin
policy and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2013-0795)

A flaw was found in the embedded WebGL library in Firefox. A web page
containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
Note: This issue only affected systems using the Intel Mesa graphics
drivers. (CVE-2013-0796)

An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the embedded Cairo library in
Firefox. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Firefox. (CVE-2013-0800)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the JavaScript history
functions. A malicious site could cause a web page to be displayed that has
a baseURI pointing to a different site, allowing cross-site scripting (XSS)
and phishing attacks. (CVE-2013-0793)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Olli Pettay, Jesse Ruderman, Boris Zbarsky, Christian
Holler, Milan Sreckovic, Joe Drew, Cody Crews, miaubiz, Abhishek Arya, and
Mariusz Mlynski as the original reporters of these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 17.0.5 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 17.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Bentley-Ottmann in Cairo comes back with INT32\_MIN (not -1) in the line segments, and those eventually pollute the traps, which then pollute the regions.

Possibly. I'm tracing through this, but it's a bit of a pain with the cairo switching between fixed and regular representations. Stopping the crash is "easy enough", I'm trying to find the problem in the computational geometry.

We're getting in trouble with negative bounds in Cairo - the funny part is that elsewhere (e.g., DrawTargetCG::Init), we assumes that Cairo can only deal with 0 < w/h < 32768, but in this case we get stuck with 5e18.Assignee: nobody → milan

Equivalently, relevant to this crash, we only crash with cairo\_set\_antialias(CAIRO\_ANTIALIAS\_NONE). CAIRO\_ANTIALIAS\_DEFAULT is fine.

Jeff, here's a question; do we patch this with a simple x1 = (x1 < 0) ? 0 : x1; etc, making sure that we don't have this kind of OOB write, then open a bug to find the cause (at which point it wouldn't be security, and wouldn't have the six week clock on it), or keep digging until we have a cause, because the bug isn't tracked against a release?Flags: needinfo?(jmuizelaar)

Some random information. This happens when the radius of the circle used as the mask is very large, but not too large. With some quick testing, r="5761126194342788607" does not crash, but one larger, r="5761126194342788608" does. If you keep increasing the radius, the last one that crashes (in this range, at least), is r="5761126744098603520px", and one larger doesn't crash again r="5761126744098603521px". The polygonization of the circle has an issue with the inclusive range [5761126744098603520px, 5761126744098603520px].

Should be [5761126194342788608px,5761126744098603520px]. Not that it is significant, but this is where a unit test would come in handy.

[Clamp negative boundaries and disallow negative sizes for pixman boxes.](attachment.cgi?id=715614&action=diff) (obsolete)

If we give some nasty data to cairo, in some cases we get back negative box boundaries. It's deterministic, though some nasty data is handled just fine (see [Comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=825721#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in pixman_fill_sse2")). This is a quick fix to make it safe; we can chase down the cause (likely in Bentley-Ottmann code) in a separate bug if required. Or wait for Cairo to fix it.

Jeff, the source code for cairo-image-surface.c is the same as you reviewed, but I wanted to check if the patch in gfx/cairo and addition to README is what you had in mind.

Assuming this doesn't affect b2g18 because no sse chip, but that it affects everything else.
Since this landed with a testcase we now have to scramble to get this into all our upcoming releases, which probably means no beta testing whatsoever of the patch at this point. This is the situation the Security-Approval process was intended to prevent.
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Bug_Approval_Process>
Please request approval on the patch (retroactively) and answer the security questions there. That will help us decide how badly we're affected and whether we must land immediately everywhere or can skip some of the branches.
Answering [comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=825721#c18 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in pixman_fill_sse2"): a cairo bug would be OK, but if they had a security-bug process that would be nice to use. we can reach the cairo folks out of band though to explain the importance of certain bugs if necessary.

[Security approval request comment] - based on [comment 28](/show_bug.cgi?id=825721#c28 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in pixman_fill_sse2")
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
We check the invalid parameters just before the call, so we do give away the information as to where it happens. If there is a way to exploit this, this probably gives a good hint where to start.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Very easily based on the unit test that has been added. It actually gives you the parameters to set on SVG to cause this crash. In other words, it is equivalent to having this whole bug being public.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
This is a bug in Cairo, so it goes back a long way.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The code patch, without the unit tests, should port cleanly.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely to cause a regression, we are taking out the scenario where we try to allocate memory using <0 number.

[Triage Comment]
Since this has already been landed to central it's too late for a sec-approval request, we need to get this on branches and we're about to build our final FF20 beta so pre-approving the patch based on the presumed ease of backporting referenced in the sec-approval form.

My bad, I missed Dan's request for a retroactive sec-approval request. Based on the potential for exploit and the low risk of this patch I'm still certain we can take this in our final beta and Milan has agreed to do the landing asap.

How about whoever does the sec-approval+ sets checkin? at the same time? Seems like a decent compromise to me. (But ultimately, I can accept some responsibility for this landing as I typically do take note of the sec rating before landing but apparently didn't do so in this case).

I'm assuming this is the one we want to land on esr17. What about Aurora?

The same patch as for beta applies to all other non-trunk versions, so if we're putting it into Aurora, it should be the same patch as for beta.

Generally, I do sec-approval (or Dan does if I don't get to it). I have no idea about your checkin flags or process there so someone would need to point me to something. I'm a program manager, not a developer.

Yeah, forget that. I'm just not going to land s-s bugs anymore unless they have sec-approval+ on them.

Flagging checkin-needed so this can be landed to ESR17 branch before Thursday's go to build on the ESR that will ship alongside FF20 and to Aurora branch as well (milan doesn't have perms to push to those branches).Keywords: [checkin-needed](/buglist.cgi?keywords=checkin-needed&resolution=---)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=946931#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-04-01 02:03:49 UTC  ``` Security researcher miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a crash in WebGL rendering when memory is freed that has not previously been allocated. This issue only affects Linux users who have Intel Mesa graphics drivers. The resulting crash could be potentially exploitable.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2013/mfsa2013-35.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Details

Olli Pettay, Jesse Ruderman, Boris Zbarsky, Christian Holler, Milan

Sreckovic and Joe Drew discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted

message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these

to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2013-0788](/security/CVE-2013-0788))

Ambroz Bizjak discovered an out-of-bounds array read in the

CERT\_DecodeCertPackage function of the Network Security Services (NSS)

libary when decoding certain certificates. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash.

([CVE-2013-0791](/security/CVE-2013-0791))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that timed history navigations could be used to

load arbitrary websites with the wrong URL displayed in the addressbar. An

attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) or

phishing attacks if scripting were enabled. ([CVE-2013-0793](/security/CVE-2013-0793))

Cody Crews discovered that the cloneNode method could be used to

bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW) to clone a protected node and bypass

same-origin policy checks. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-0795](/security/CVE-2013-0795))

A crash in WebGL rendering was discovered in Thunderbird. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of

the user invoking Thunderbird if scripting were enabled. This issue only

affects users with Intel graphics drivers. ([CVE-2013-0796](/security/CVE-2013-0796))

Abhishek Arya discovered an out-of-bounds write in the Cairo graphics

library. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with

the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-0800](/security/CVE-2013-0800))

## Synopsis

Important: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0697)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0788)

A flaw was found in the way Same Origin Wrappers were implemented in
Thunderbird. Malicious content could use this flaw to bypass the
same-origin policy and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0795)

A flaw was found in the embedded WebGL library in Thunderbird. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. Note: This issue
only affected systems using the Intel Mesa graphics drivers.
(CVE-2013-0796)

An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the embedded Cairo library in
Thunderbird. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0800)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled the JavaScript history
functions. Malicious content could cause a page to be displayed that
has a baseURI pointing to a different site, allowing cross-site scripting
(XSS) and phishing attacks. (CVE-2013-0793)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Olli Pettay, Jesse Ruderman, Boris Zbarsky, Christian
Holler, Milan Sreckovic, Joe Drew, Cody Crews, miaubiz, Abhishek Arya, and
Mariusz Mlynski as the original reporters of these issues.

Note: All issues except CVE-2013-0800 cannot be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 17.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

An update that fixes 12 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes four new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox has been updated to the 17.0.5ESR release
fixing bugs and security issues.
Also Mozilla NSS has been updated to version 3.14.3 and
Mozilla NSPR to 4.9.6.
\*
MFSA 2013-30: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
Olli Pettay, Jesse Ruderman, Boris Zbarsky, Christian
Holler, Milan Sreckovic, and Joe Drew reported memory
safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 17, and
Firefox 19. (CVE-2013-0788)
Andrew McCreight, Randell Jesup, Gary Kwong, Jesse
Ruderman, Christian Holler, and Mats Palmgren reported
memory safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox 19.
(CVE-2013-0789)
Jim Chen reported a memory safety problem that
affects Firefox for Android
\*
(CVE-2013-0790)
\*
MFSA 2013-31 / CVE-2013-0800: Security researcher
Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team
used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover an
out-of-bounds write in Cairo graphics library. When certain
values are passed to it during rendering, Cairo attempts to
use negative boundaries or sizes for boxes, leading to a
potentially exploitable crash in some instances.
\*
MFSA 2013-32 / CVE-2013-0799: Security researcher
Frederic Hoguin discovered that the Mozilla Maintenance
Service on Windows was vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
This system is used to update software without invoking the
User Account Control (UAC) prompt. The Mozilla Maintenance
Service is configured to allow unprivileged users to start
it with arbitrary arguments. By manipulating the data
passed in these arguments, an attacker can execute
arbitrary code with the system privileges used by the
service. This issue requires local file system access to be
exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-33 / CVE-2013-0798: Security researcher
Shuichiro Suzuki of the Fourteenforty Research Institute
reported the app\_tmp directory is set to be world readable
and writeable by Firefox for Android. This potentially
allows for third party applications to replace or alter
Firefox add-ons when downloaded because they are
temporarily stored in the app\_tmp directory before
installation.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2013-34 / CVE-2013-0797: Security researcher Ash
reported an issue with the Mozilla Updater. The Mozilla
Updater can be made to load a malicious local DLL file in a
privileged context through either the Mozilla Maintenance
Service or independently on systems that do not use the
service. This occurs when the DLL file is placed in a
specific location on the local system before the Mozilla
Updater is run. Local file system access is necessary in
order for this issue to be exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-35 / CVE-2013-0796: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a crash
in WebGL rendering when memory is freed that has not
previously been allocated. This issue only affects Linux
users who have Intel Mesa graphics drivers. The resulting
crash could be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-36 / CVE-2013-0795: Security researcher
Cody Crews reported a mechanism to use the cloneNode method
to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW) and clone a protected
node. This allows violation of the browser's same origin
policy and could also lead to privilege escalation and the
execution of arbitrary code.
\*
MFSA 2013-37 / CVE-2013-0794: Security researcher
shutdown reported a method for removing the origin
indication on tab-modal dialog boxes in combination with
browser navigation. This could allow an attacker's dialog
to overlay a page and show another site's content. This can
be used for phishing by allowing users to enter data into a
modal prompt dialog on an attacking, site while appearing
to be from the displayed site.
\*
MFSA 2013-38 / CVE-2013-079: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported a method to use browser
navigations through history to load an arbitrary website
with that page's baseURI property pointing to another site
instead of the seemingly loaded one. The user will continue
to see the incorrect site in the addressbar of the browser.
This allows for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or the
theft of data through a phishing attack.
\*
MFSA 2013-39 / CVE-2013-0792: Mozilla community
member Tobias Schula reported that if
gfx.color\_management.enablev4 preference is enabled
manually in about:config, some grayscale PNG images will be
rendered incorrectly and cause memory corruption during PNG
decoding when certain color profiles are in use. A crafted
PNG image could use this flaw to leak data through rendered
images drawing from random memory. By default, this
preference is not enabled.
\*
MFSA 2013-40 / CVE-2013-0791: Mozilla community
member Ambroz Bizjak reported an out-of-bounds array read
in the CERT\_DecodeCertPackage function of the Network
Security Services (NSS) libary when decoding a certificate.
When this occurs, it will lead to memory corruption and a
non-exploitable crash.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=946929#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-04-01 02:01:22 UTC  ``` Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover an out-of-bounds write in Cairo graphics library. When certain values are passed to it during rendering, Cairo attempts to use negative boundaries or sizes for boxes, leading to a potentially exploitable crash in some instances.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
