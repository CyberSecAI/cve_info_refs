We’ve also resolved a high severity security issue by disabling MathML in this release. The WebKit MathML implementation isn’t quite ready for prime time yet but we are excited to enable it again in a future release once the security issues have been addressed.

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer).

We’d also like to thank Christian Holler, miaubiz and Atte Kettunen for working with us during the development cycle and preventing security regressions from ever reaching the stable channel. Rewards were issued.

A full list of changes in this build is available in the [SVN revision log](http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/trunk/src&range=165096:173683&mode=html).

- Update to 26.0.1403
\* Bug and stability fixes
- Using system libxml2 requires system libxslt.

them.
- Avoid using dlopen on system libraries, rpm or the
package Manager do not handle this at all. tested for a
few weeks and implemented with a macro so it can be
easily disabled if problems arise.
- Use SOME system libraries instead of the bundled ones,
tested for several weeks and implemented with a macro
for easy enable/Disable in case of trouble.

# Opus downloads

Even though Opus is now standardized by the IETF, this Opus implementation will keep improving in the future.
Of course, **all future versions will still be fully compliant with the Opus IETF specification**.

See the [development](/development) page for the latest development information.

## Development binary builds

In addition to [support in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Media_formats_supported_by_the_audio_and_video_elements#Ogg_Opus), Mozilla provides binary builds of Opus utilities.

* opus-tools 0.2
  (Opus 1.3)
  + [Source](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/opus/opus-tools-0.2.tar.gz)
  + [Windows](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/opus/win32/opus-tools-0.2-opus-1.3.zip)
  + [OS X (older)](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/opus/macos/opus-tools-0.1.9-macos.tar.gz)

Opus-tools provides command-line utilities to encode, inspect, and decode .opus files.

## Source code (stable release)

* ### [libopus 1.5.2](/release/stable/2024/04/12/libopus-1_5_2.html)

  Apr 12, 2024

  Opus 1.5.2 fixes several build issues that were discovered since
  the 1.5 release. It also fixes a misalignment issue in the AVX2 code
  that could cause crashes under Windows.

## Source code (development releases)

* ### [opusfile 0.12](/release/dev/2020/06/27/opusfile_0_12.html)

  Jun 27, 2020

  The opusfile library provides seeking, decode, and playback
  of Opus streams in the Ogg container (.opus files) including
  over http(s) on posix and windows systems.

  opusfile depends on libopus and libogg.
  The included opusurl library for http(s) access depends on
  opusfile and openssl.

  Changes since the v0.11 release:

  + Fix stack overflow buffering out-of-sequence streams.
  + Fix possible divide-by-zero.
  + Fix issues with seeking in the win32 backend.
  + Fix an issue where the seek algorithm could be confused
    by stream data changing between reads.
  + Clean up compiler and scan-build warnings.
  + Avoid use of the deprecated ftime() function
    which has Y2038 problems.
  + Remove undefined behaviour memcpy(NULL) in op\_read\_native().
  + Visual Studio project files updated for libogg 1.3.4 library name change.
  + Various build systems updates.
  + Various integration and testing environment improvements.

  This release is backward-compatible with the previous
  release. We recommend all users upgrade.

  Note that because of the removal of certificate store hooks
  in openssl 1.1.1 and later, there are unfortunately no
  supported versions of that library which can be used with
  the code in opusurl to validate https responses against
  the system certificate store on Windows. Using the system
  default access to the certificate store on other platforms
  works fine.

  Source code:
  [opusfile-0.12.tar.gz](https://downloads.xiph.org/releases/opus/opusfile-0.12.tar.gz),
  [opusfile-0.12.zip](https://downloads.xiph.org/releases/opus/opusfile-0.12.zip).

  ```

  No Windows build is available for this release.
  Developers should integrate the source code directly into their applications.

  Programming documentation is available in tree and
  [online](https://opus-codec.org/docs/).

  The library is functional, but there are likely issues
  we didnât find in our own testing. Please give feedback
  in #opus on irc.libera.chat, opus@xiph.org, or at
  [gitlab](https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/opusfile).

* ### [libopusenc 0.2.1](/release/dev/2018/10/09/libopusenc-0_2_1.html)

  Oct 9, 2018

  This release fixes two minor bugs:

  + a gapless bug in the LPC filtering
  + a crash on destroy when using the pull API

  Source code: [libopusenc-0.2.1.tar.gz](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/opus/libopusenc-0.2.1.tar.gz)

* ### [opus-tools 0.2](/release/dev/2018/09/18/opus-tools-0_2.html)

  Sep 18, 2018

  In this release the Opus decoder opusdec has been converted to use the
  opusfile library, and the Opus encoder opusenc has been converted to use
  the libopusenc library. These libraries make it easy to robustly read
  and write Ogg Opus audio files, and enable some new features. Both
  libraries are available on the
  [Downloads](https://opus-codec.org/downloads/) page.

  opusdec enhancements include:

  + Read directly from http or https sources
  + New option `--force-stereo` will force stereo output
  + Improved support for chained input files with differing sample rate or
    channel count
  + A summary is displayed for METADATA\_BLOCK\_PICTURE tags rather than
    displaying the base64-encoded data

  opusenc enhancements include:

  + Delayed decision support allows the encoder to look ahead up to two
    seconds in order to improve encoding decisions
  + The options `--music` and `--speech` can be used to tune low bitrate audio
    for music or speech, overriding automatic detection
  + The option `--no-phase-inv` disables the use of phase inversion for
    intensity stereo, which can be useful for streams that are likely to
    be downmixed to mono after decoding
  + New `--tracknumber` shortcut for setting tracknumber metadata

  Additionally:

  + The opusinfo utility can display the demixing matrix from Ogg Opus
    files using ambisonics channel mapping family 3
  + The experimental opusrtp tool supports new options to specify RTP
    payload type, Ogg Opus output file, original sample rate, and number
    of channels, and supports improved transmit timing, arbitrary
    network devices, and IPv6
  + The Visual Studio 2015 project builds opusenc support for FLAC input
  + The old Visual Studio 2010 project has been removed
  + Numerous bug fixes are also included

  release candidate of the upcoming Opus 1.3 includes:

  + Fixing an issue with bandwidth detection
  + Enabling Ambisonics support by default
  + Using mapping families 2 and 3 for Ambisonics (instead of experimental families 253 and 254)
  + Enabling hardening by default
