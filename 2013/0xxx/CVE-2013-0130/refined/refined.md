- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in CoreFTP when parsing long directory names received from a malicious FTP server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs when handling long directory names. Specifically, LIST, VIEW, and DELE commands are vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service and, in the case of the DELE command, arbitrary code execution on the user's computer. An attacker can achieve this by tricking a user into visiting a malicious FTP server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious FTP server sending long directory names to a vulnerable CoreFTP client. The user must be tricked into connecting to the malicious server and potentially execute the vulnerable commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control an FTP server and trick a user into connecting to it using a vulnerable version of CoreFTP. The attacker crafts malicious responses to FTP commands with overly long directory names.
