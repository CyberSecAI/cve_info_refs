# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-024 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in SharePoint Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2780176)

Published: March 12, 2013

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft SharePoint Foundation. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user clicks a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted SharePoint site.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 and rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities correcting the way that Microsoft SharePoint Server validates URLs and user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## Callback Function Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0080

An elevation of privilege exists in Microsoft SharePoint Server. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could allow an attacker, after obtaining sensitive system data, elevate their access to the server.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-0080](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-0080).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.

#### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly handle properly validate user input.
