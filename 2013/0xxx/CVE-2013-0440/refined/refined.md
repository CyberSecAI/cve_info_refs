Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0440:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extension) component of OpenJDK's SSL/TLS implementation. It does not properly enforce handshake message ordering, which allows an attacker to repeatedly restart the handshake process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Incorrect enforcement of packet order during SSL/TLS handshake.
*   Allows unlimited handshake restarts.
*   Improper handling of `ClientHello` packets in the handshake.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by making the SSL/TLS server consume an excessive amount of CPU time.
*   The server performs expensive computations repeatedly when generating `ServerHello` responses for re-sent `ClientHello` packets.
*   The attacker can keep the server busy by maintaining an open connection and continually re-sending `ClientHello` packets.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote exploitation over a network.
*   Attacker needs to establish an SSL/TLS connection to the server.
*   Repeatedly sending specially crafted `ClientHello` packets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Ability to establish a network connection to the vulnerable server
*   Ability to craft and send `ClientHello` packets.
*   Need to keep the connection open to continue sending packets.
*  No authentication required

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to an OpenSSL vulnerability ([CVE-2011-4619](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4619)), but it's not related to server-gated cryptography (SGC) as in the OpenSSL case.
*   The issue is related to improper packet order enforcement in the SSL/TLS handshake.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in: Oracle Java SE 7 Update 13 and 6 Update 39, IcedTea 6 1.11.6, 1.12.1 and IcedTea7 2.1.5, 2.2.5, and 2.3.6.
* Red Hat errata information indicates this was addressed in multiple RHSA releases: RHSA-2013:0236, RHSA-2013:0237, RHSA-2013:0245, RHSA-2013:0246 and RHSA-2013:0247, RHSA-2013:1455, RHSA-2013:1456.
