- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A local user who is not an administrator can disable FileVault using the command-line.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local, non-administrator user can disable FileVault, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: Local command-line access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local user access to the system, but does not need to be an administrator.
