Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0770:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**
   - The content from `lists.opensuse.org`, `www.ubuntu.com`, and `www.mozilla.org` directly mentions CVE-2013-0770 as a vulnerability addressed in their security updates. 
   - The bugzilla entries (768750, 756581, 795284, 787818) are all mentioned in the context of this CVE and the corresponding Mozilla Security Advisory (MFSA) - thus relevant to this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - **Multiple Memory Safety Issues:** The primary root cause is identified as memory safety issues, such as use-after-free, out-of-bounds read, buffer overflow, and other memory corruption issues within Firefox's browser engine. These issues are identified through tools like Address Sanitizer.
   - **Specific Code Locations:** Some specific code locations where these vulnerabilities were found include:
      - `js/src/jsopcode.cpp:786`: Related to JavaScript OOM testing and assertions.
      - `mozilla::TracerRunnable::~TracerRunnable()`:  A write-after-free scenario.
      - XBL (Extensible Binding Language) and interaction with JS, XUL and SVG
      - `nsXULPopupManager::HidePopupCallback @ nsMenuPopupFrame::HidePopup`: A crash related to UI and popups with TestPilot.
   - **JavaScript Engine:** Flaws were found in the Javascript engine of Firefox that can lead to incorrect garbage collection or memory allocation issues.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Memory Corruption:** Various memory corruption bugs, such as use-after-free, heap and global buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, integer overflow leading to buffer overflow.
   - **Assertion Failures:**  Assertion failures due to invalid states during operation of JavaScript.
   - **Information Leakage:** The `toString` function of XBL objects is vulnerable to information leakage by revealing memory layout.
   - **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** Events in the plugin handler can be manipulated to bypass same-origin policy restrictions leading to clickjacking.
    - **Improper threading:** Improper handling of SSL connections on different threads leading to exploitable crash.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the browser (most severe impact)
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Vulnerabilities could cause application crashes leading to DoS.
   - **Information Leakage:** Memory address layout information can be leaked that might bypass ASLR
   - **Clickjacking:** Through a flaw in plugin handling, it's possible to bypass security and perform clickjacking attacks.
   - **URL Spoofing/Phishing:** Displayed URL values in the address bar can be spoofed during loading, which could lead to phishing.
   - **Bypass Chrome Object Wrappers:** Changing the prototype of an object can bypass Chrome Object Wrappers (COW).
   - **Privilege Escalation:** A possible way to access chrome privileged pages using plugin objects and interaction with SVG elements.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Specially Crafted Web Pages:** By tricking a user into opening specially crafted web pages, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities.
   - **Plugin Manipulation:** Web content can manipulate plugin events to bypass SOP restrictions.
    - **SSL Downloads:** Issues in how threads are handled during downloads over SSL can be exploited.
   - **XBL Files:** By using XBL files with multiple XML bindings and SVG content, attackers can cause memory corruption
    - **Javascript Operations** Integer overflow when calculating the length of Javascript strings can lead to buffer overflows.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, sending malicious web pages for the user to open.
    - **Some attack vectors require a specific user interaction**.
   - **Basic Web Development Skills:**  Ability to craft HTML, JavaScript, SVG and XBL code that triggers the vulnerabilities.
   - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** In the case of the TURKTRUST certificate, a MITM position is needed to exploit the mis-issued certificates.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Multiple Bug Fixes:**  The security update addresses a cluster of vulnerabilities in one go, including issues found by different researchers and Mozilla developers.
- **Testing Tools:** Tools like the Address Sanitizer were instrumental in uncovering many of these bugs.
- **Firefox Versions Affected:** Multiple versions, including ESR (Extended Support Release) and standard releases, of Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey were affected by these vulnerabilities, highlighting the wide-reaching impact of the bugs
- **Security Levels:** Some vulnerabilities were labeled with severity as "critical" or "moderate".
- **Patches:** Fixes involve changes to Javascript Engine, layout, XBL, UI event handling, and windowing components.

In summary, CVE-2013-0770 is a meta-CVE encompassing a range of memory safety issues in Mozilla products that could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information leakage, and other attacks if successfully exploited. Patches address these via careful memory management, validation, and correcting incorrect threading or event handling.
