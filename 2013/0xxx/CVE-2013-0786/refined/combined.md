The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)
* [6 Sheriffing](#Sheriffing)
* [7 Firefox](#Firefox)
* [8 Community reported bugs](#Community_reported_bugs)
* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=824399#c0)• 12 years ago |
|  | |

In Bugzilla 2.17.1 ([bug 179960](/show_bug.cgi?id=179960 "RESOLVED FIXED - QuickSearch queries are slow and time out")), Bugzilla::Search::build\_subselect() was introduced to improve performance when querying products and components. Its job is to run the subselect itself and return the corresponding product/component IDs. But by doing this, it leaks the existence of products and components you cannot see.
If you try to directly access a product you cannot see, Bugzilla will throw an error of the form "either this product doesn't exist, or you don't have access to it". This means you have no way to know if this product exists, as expected. But when running queries, build\_subselect() will return 1=2 if the product doesn't exist at all, else it will return the product ID. So you can use this trick to determine if a product doesn't exist at all, or exists but you are not allowed to access it.
Bugzilla 2.17.1 to 4.0.x are affected (due to [bug 179960](/show_bug.cgi?id=179960 "RESOLVED FIXED - QuickSearch queries are slow and time out")), then 4.1.1 to 4.4rc1 are not affected (due to [bug 579568](/show_bug.cgi?id=579568 "RESOLVED FIXED - Search.pm: Improve the implementation and performance of substring and \"words\" searches")), and 4.4rc1+ to 4.5 are affected again (due to [bug 780820](/show_bug.cgi?id=780820 "RESOLVED FIXED - Allow multiple custom search criteria to match one field")). As we didn't release 4.4rc2 or 4.5.1 yet, only the 3.6.x and 4.0.x releases are affected by this issue.
There is a clear performance by running the subselects in build\_subselect() itself and returning the IDs only, so we certainly don't want to revert that. So I have no idea how to fix this issue. The only way would be to disable the debug mode entirely, but that's too useful to be disabled.

Given [bug 824262](/show_bug.cgi?id=824262 "RESOLVED FIXED - Querying for strings in comments is now ultra slow") is affected by the same issue (albeit not a security one) maybe the best option (for fixing both bugs) is have a new column in fielddefs (or hardcoded in Search.pm) whether to pre-compute sub selects or not)
e.g. change the if statement in <https://bug824262.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=695242>

No, because if we return subselects for products and components instead of returning the hardcoded list of IDs, the perf penalty is huge again. So from a performance point of view, it makes total sense to execute the subselects ourselves for products and components.
As I said in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=824399#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] build_subselect() leaks the existence of products and components you cannot access"), maybe disabling the debug mode for non-admins (or some other group) is the only viable way to fix this issue.

Would it be possible to have the context of "visible products" specified as a condition to the subselect when generating queries? That would solve the problem, too.

We cannot rely on the caller to think about security when calling Bugzilla::Search. As discussed on IRC, I'm not a fan to have build\_subselect() add additional criteria itself when talking about products or components, because this means joining the group\_control\_map and the user\_group\_map tables, making the whole thing slower again. As we already filter bugs the user can see, this would mean doing security checks twice (more or less, because a product can be visible while a bug in this product is restricted to a group you don't belong to).
Honestly, 99% of users don't even know about this debug mode in buglist.cgi, and the remaining 1% is mostly developers. Developers usually test stuff on their own local test installation, where they are admins. So I would be in favor to restrict the debug mode to members of the admin group only. I don't want to regress performance of Bugzilla::Search because a few users may want to play with the debug mode to try to collect some info about products or components + other fields we may not think about (I guess group names have the same problem, ditto for target milestones and versions).
Moreover, it's reasonable to assume that on some installations which have their own (additional) code to get bugs, the content of the generated SQL query may reveal confidential data that admins wouldn't want to make public.

this sounds like the best approach to me.
instead of hardcoding the admin group, it would be useful to have the group configurable so sites can choose to bless debug abilities onto trusted users without giving them full admin.

Is anyone working on fixing this? If not, I'm happy to give this a crack on Monday (AEST).
One question though, should the group name by configured in the data/params file, like the insidergroup value is (default value: admin), or should I automatically create a new group?
I can imagine some installations may want to set this value as blank as either (a) they are not affected by this issue (no private products) or (b) the requiredlogin value is set.

No need for a hardcoded group. Simply add a new param named e.g. "debugger\_group", and set it to admin by default.

Blank means nobody can access the feature, because nobody belongs to the group. That's the desired behavior.

For the reasons stated above, I would take blank to mean debug is available to everyone (most installations don't have a everybody group like bmo does)

No, else this param would behave in the exact opposite way of other group parameters. Leaving a group param blank always meant to disable the feature. I don't want to make an exception here.

First crack at this. Tested against trunk, patches cleanly against 4.0 (with offsets). I'm not entirely sure about the wording of the message on the parameters page. If you want it changed, please suggest an alternative :)
I also decided to silently ignore a user that tried to view debugging information without being in the appropriate group. If you want an error message to appear, let me know.

v1 patch
>=== modified file 'Bugzilla/Config/GroupSecurity.pm'
>+ name => 'debuggroup',
Let's name it debug\_group, to follow our guidelines (old param names were using the foobar syntax instead of the more readable foo\_bar).
>=== modified file 'buglist.cgi'
>+if ($cgi->param('debug')
>+ and $user->in\_group(Bugzilla->params->{debuggroup})
Before calling $user->in\_group(), you must make sure that debug\_group is set. Also, let's use && instead of and, which is what we use 99.5% of the time.
You must also patch report.cgi and/or reports/report.html.tmpl which also have a debug mode.

Do not mention products and components specifically, nor the bug ID (that's not the right place for it anyway). Also, this parameter is not specific to buglist.cgi as report.cgi is involved too.

This change must be reverted. It's fine to display raw data for reports for all users, as it displays the same data as in the table itself, but in a different way.
>-if ($cgi->param('debug')) {
>+if ($debug) {
This change must be reverted too, for the same reason as above.
What must be fixed is this line:
$vars->{'debug'} = $cgi->param('debug');
else the template still displays debug stuff about executed SQL queries.
Everything else is fine.

To be honest, I don't want this fix for 3.6 and 4.0. Adding a new group so late in these respective branches is not a good idea, IMO. 3.6 is going to reach EOL very soon anyway. 4.2 is not affected so that's not a problem and it doesn't need the fix. This leaves us with 4.4 and trunk only where I'm fine to take this fix.
What do you guys think?

I disagree. It should be fixed for Bugzilla 4.0. We aren't adding a new group, we are adding a new parameter. It's not ideal, but some sites (brc included) wouldn't want the existence of products shown.
Given that this bug was originally public, it is the reason we haven't put a 4.4rc1 preview on a public facing server.
Having said that brc is currently running 4.2, so from that perspective it doesn't bother me if you don't fix Bugzilla 4.0.

Looks like a simple enough patch to be safe in 4.0 to me.

The question is not about the patch being trivial/safe but about adding a new parameter in the 10th minor release of a stable branch. For 3.6, this would be the 13th minor release on that branch. Is that really what we want?

I would prefer a fix like you did for buglist.cgi, i.e.:
if ($cgi->param('debug')
&& Bugzilla->params->{debug\_group}
&& Bugzilla->user->in\_group(Bugzilla->params->{debug\_group}))
{
$vars->{'debug'} = 1;
}
This way we don't waste cycles into ->in\_group() if the user didn't ask for debug stuff.
r=LpSolit with this comment fixed. Please upload an updated patch which includes this fix.

Most of that argument is irrelevant because it's a security fix. What we want is the safety and security of our users.

The patch doesn't apply cleanly to 4.2 and older (conflict in report.cgi). It needs to be backported.

This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

Tuesday, Feb 19th, 2013

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* When viewing a bug report, a bug ID containing random code is not
  correctly sanitized in the HTML page if the specified page format
  is invalid. This can lead to XSS.

* When running a query in debug mode, it is possible to determine if
  a given confidential field value (such as a product name) exists.
  Bugzilla 4.1 and newer are not affected by this issue.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.0 to 3.6.12, 3.7.1 to 4.0.9, 4.1.1 to 4.2.4, 4.3.1 to 4.4rc1
Fixed In:    3.6.13, 4.0.10, 4.2.5, 4.4rc2
Description: When viewing a single bug report, which is the default,
             the bug ID is validated and rejected if it is invalid.
             But when viewing several bug reports at once, which is
             specified by the format=multiple parameter, invalid bug
             IDs can go through and are sanitized in the HTML page
             itself. But when an invalid page format is passed to the
             CGI script, the wrong HTML page is called and data are not
             correctly sanitized, which can lead to XSS.

CVE Number:  CVE-2013-0785

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    2.17.1 to 3.6.12, 3.7.1 to 4.0.9
Fixed In:    3.6.13, 4.0.10
Description: When running a query in debug mode, the generated SQL
             query used to collect the data is displayed. The way this
             SQL query is built permits the user to determine if some
             confidential field value (such as a product name) exists.
             This problem only affects Bugzilla 4.0.9 and older. Newer
             releases are not affected by this issue.
