Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0786:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `Bugzilla::Search::build_subselect()` function handles queries for products and components when the debug mode is enabled. This function was introduced to improve performance by pre-computing subselects and returning product/component IDs. However, it leaks information about the existence of products and components that a user doesn't have access to. Specifically, it would return `1=2` if a product didn't exist and the product ID if it did, even if a user didn't have access to view the product.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the unintended disclosure of existence of products and components to unauthorized users.
*   **Insecure Debug Mode:**  The debug mode, which is intended for development and troubleshooting, reveals underlying SQL queries. The way these queries were constructed allowed for the information leakage.
*   **Lack of access control in debug mode:** Debug mode was not restricted to admin users, allowing non-privileged users to potentially access the sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
* Determine the existence of private/confidential products and components within a Bugzilla instance.
* Gain insights into the structure and configuration of the Bugzilla system.
* This information can be combined with other vulnerabilities to further attacks

**Attack vectors:**
*   A user with access to buglist.cgi or report.cgi can use the `debug` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid Bugzilla user account with the ability to run queries on bug lists and reports.
*   The attacker must be aware of the `debug` parameter in `buglist.cgi` or `report.cgi` to trigger the information leak.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Bugzilla versions 2.17.1 to 3.6.12, and 3.7.1 to 4.0.9. Bugzilla 4.1 and newer are not affected.
*   The fix involves restricting the debug mode to members of a configurable group (defaulting to "admin"). This prevents non-authorized users from seeing the raw SQL queries and thus prevents the information leak.
*   Patches for the fix were applied to Bugzilla versions 3.6.13, 4.0.10, 4.2.5, and 4.4rc2.
*   The fix introduces a new parameter, "debugger\_group", allowing administrators to specify which group of users can access the debug mode.
