  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The fact and report import APIs in Foreman were accessible to any remote host without authentication, and they accepted YAML input. This allowed for the creation of arbitrary objects on the Foreman server through YAML parsing.",

      "Unauthenticated access to the import APIs",
      "Insecure YAML parsing",
      "Lack of input sanitization"

        "Sending crafted YAML payloads to the vulnerable import APIs.",
        "No authentication or authorization required to access the vulnerable endpoints"
    ],
