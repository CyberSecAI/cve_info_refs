  "description": "`rack/file.rb` (`Rack::File`) in Rack 1.5.x before 1.5.2 and 1.4.x before 1.4.5 allows attackers to access arbitrary files outside the intended root directory via a crafted `PATH_INFO` environment variable, probably a directory traversal vulnerability that is remotely exploitable, aka \"symlink path traversals.\"",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Improper path sanitization in `rack/file.rb`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal (CWE-22)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file access outside the intended root directory.",
    "attackVectors": "A crafted `PATH_INFO` environment variable.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable server/application with the crafted `PATH_INFO`.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted `PATH_INFO` which includes directory traversal sequences, allowing an attacker to read files outside the webroot."
