| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c0)  Michael S.    2013-01-12 22:55:31 UTC  ``` It seems that redis 2.4 use a predictible file name in /tmp/ as some kind of swap file :      server.vm_swap_file = zstrdup("/tmp/redis-%p.vm");  this was removed in 2.6 ( deprecated code ), but 2.4 is in fedora 18 and epel 6 AFAIK.  Since redis do not care if the file exist or not before opening it ( and in fact, I think it try to reuse if it already exist ), this could be used by a attacker to erase a arbitrary file with a symlink to the file. Depending if redis is running as root or not, this could be dangerous, or just a minor nuisance.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 14:43:55 UTC  ``` Thank you for this report, Michael. I am going to steal this bug to be a security response product (as there are more products affected by this issue than just upcoming Fedora-18).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 14:50:58 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the redis package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16 and 17.  --  This issue affects the versions of the redis package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 and Fedora EPEL 6.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:46:32 UTC  ``` The upstream patch which fixed the "/tmp/redis-%p.vm" insecure flaw (but also introduced different one in "/tmp/redis.ds") is the following one:   <https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/697af434fbeb2e3ba2ba9687cd283ed1a2734fa5>  So to fix this issue it would be easier to rebase to latest 2.6.* version, which doesn't contain the issue any more.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:48:23 UTC  ``` Michael, since there is an upstream patch for this issue available already (latest 2.6.* version is not affected by this problem), would you mind if we would open this bug and request CVE identifier for it publicly?  Let us know. Thank you, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c5)  Michael S.    2013-01-14 15:53:23 UTC  ``` No problem for me.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:54:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c5)) > No problem for me.  Thank you. Will request CVE id shortly.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:58:39 UTC  ``` Created redis tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 895120](show_bug.cgi?id=895120 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - redis 2.4: Insecure temporary flaw use for redis service's vm swap file [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 895121](show_bug.cgi?id=895121 "CLOSED ERRATA - redis 2.4: Insecure temporary flaw use for redis service's vm swap file [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 16:11:42 UTC  ``` CVE request: [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/14/3>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c9)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-15 16:51:05 UTC  ``` Two CVEs were assigned here:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/14/7>  [CVE-2013-0178](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0178) for the insecure /tmp usage in 2.4 [CVE-2013-0180](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0180) for the insecure /tmp usage in 2.6  Since we only ship 2.4-based versions, only noting the first CVE as applicable to us in this bug.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c0)  Michael S.    2013-01-12 22:55:31 UTC  ``` It seems that redis 2.4 use a predictible file name in /tmp/ as some kind of swap file :      server.vm_swap_file = zstrdup("/tmp/redis-%p.vm");  this was removed in 2.6 ( deprecated code ), but 2.4 is in fedora 18 and epel 6 AFAIK.  Since redis do not care if the file exist or not before opening it ( and in fact, I think it try to reuse if it already exist ), this could be used by a attacker to erase a arbitrary file with a symlink to the file. Depending if redis is running as root or not, this could be dangerous, or just a minor nuisance.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 14:43:55 UTC  ``` Thank you for this report, Michael. I am going to steal this bug to be a security response product (as there are more products affected by this issue than just upcoming Fedora-18).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 14:50:58 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the redis package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16 and 17.  --  This issue affects the versions of the redis package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 and Fedora EPEL 6.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:46:32 UTC  ``` The upstream patch which fixed the "/tmp/redis-%p.vm" insecure flaw (but also introduced different one in "/tmp/redis.ds") is the following one:   <https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/697af434fbeb2e3ba2ba9687cd283ed1a2734fa5>  So to fix this issue it would be easier to rebase to latest 2.6.* version, which doesn't contain the issue any more.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:48:23 UTC  ``` Michael, since there is an upstream patch for this issue available already (latest 2.6.* version is not affected by this problem), would you mind if we would open this bug and request CVE identifier for it publicly?  Let us know. Thank you, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c5)  Michael S.    2013-01-14 15:53:23 UTC  ``` No problem for me.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:54:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c5)) > No problem for me.  Thank you. Will request CVE id shortly.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 15:58:39 UTC  ``` Created redis tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 895120](show_bug.cgi?id=895120 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - redis 2.4: Insecure temporary flaw use for redis service's vm swap file [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 895121](show_bug.cgi?id=895121 "CLOSED ERRATA - redis 2.4: Insecure temporary flaw use for redis service's vm swap file [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-14 16:11:42 UTC  ``` CVE request: [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/14/3>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c9)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-15 16:51:05 UTC  ``` Two CVEs were assigned here:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/14/7>  [CVE-2013-0178](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0178) for the insecure /tmp usage in 2.4 [CVE-2013-0180](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0180) for the insecure /tmp usage in 2.6  Since we only ship 2.4-based versions, only noting the first CVE as applicable to us in this bug.   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-01-14 20:07:42 UTC  ``` From $URL :  Issue #1: =========    Michael Scherer in the following Red Hat bugzilla:   [1] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=894659>  pointed out, Redis, a persistent key-value database of version 2.4 to be prone to temporary file use in src/redis.c:    server.vm_swap_file = zstrdup("/tmp/redis-%p.vm");  [2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=894659#c0>  Note: This problem was fix by the patch [3] below.  Issue #2: ========= When searching for a patch, that corrected the issue [2] above, found out it was patch  [3] <https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/697af434fbeb2e3ba2ba9687cd283ed1a2734fa5> ,  but it also introduced another insecure temporary flaw in src/redis.c:    776 	+    server.ds_path = zstrdup("/tmp/redis.ds");  Note: Issue #2 is also fixed in recent upstream 2.6.7 / 2.6.8       versions. If you want me to find exact patch, which       corrected the second problem, let me know and i will       provide the commit id. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Johan Bergström    2013-01-14 21:15:36 UTC  ``` 1: Since we only have newer than 2.6.7 in tree, I'm therefore assuming that 2.6 is safe (from a gentoo perspective)?  2: Just checked the 2.4 branch, and this code at least still seems to be in there.  Here's the following commit to the offending line in unstable/2.6 branch: <https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/4ab988238f7418d018bf4412c6c956845ffbeab9>  The two branches are diverging and neither patches will apply cleanly to a 2.4. Has this been reported upstream? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Dirkjan Ochtman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-01-24 12:03:41 UTC  ``` Johan, can you look for upstream reports for 2.4.x/report it upstream? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Johan Bergström    2013-02-26 01:19:26 UTC  ``` fwiw, I emailed upstream at January 25th. No response yet. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Dirkjan Ochtman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2014-03-30 19:51:28 UTC  ``` Johan, any news here? Is this still relevant? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Johan Bergström    2014-03-30 22:41:55 UTC  ``` Unfortunately no. I don't think upstream has officially "accepted" it. Haven't really found that any other distros seems to carry a patch for it. I could partly be blamed for not searching enough though. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-11-23 19:31:25 UTC  ``` As of today, v2.4 branch is still affected: <https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/2.4/src/redis.c#L847>. In other words we can expect that CVE-2013-0178 will be never fixed.  CVE-2013-0180 which was assigned for the same problem in v2.6 branch and got fixed according to "git log -S "/tmp" src/redis.c" (command must be run in 2.6 branch) when upstream removed diskstore via <https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/c9d0c3623a7714bd41a35237f4ba927206a7adb6>.  $ git tag --contains c9d0c3623a7714bd41a35237f4ba927206a7adb6 | sort 2.6.0 2.6.0-rc1 2.6.0-rc2 2.6.0-rc3 2.6.0-rc4 2.6.0-rc5 2.6.0-rc6 2.6.0-rc7 2.6.0-rc8 2.6.1 [...]  ...so I don't understand why a CVE was ever assigned for v2.6.0 because no v2.6 release ever tagged created something in /tmp.  Anyways, v2.6.7 was the first version which appeared in Gentoo repository not containing the flaw, see <https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-db/redis/redis-2.6.7.ebuild?hideattic=0&view=log>  As of today the first stable redis version in Gentoo repository is =dev-db/redis-2.8.17-r1 and no vulnerable versions left. So nothing left to do for us.   @ Security: Please vote! ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-11-25 06:01:30 UTC  ``` GLSA Vote: No ``` |  |
