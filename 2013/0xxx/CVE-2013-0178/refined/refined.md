{
  "CVE-2013-0178": {
    "Description": "Insecure temporary file vulnerability in Redis before 2.6 related to /tmp/redis-%p.vm.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Redis server creates a temporary swap file in the /tmp directory using a predictable filename, specifically `/tmp/redis-%p.vm`, where `%p` is the process ID. This predictable filename allows an attacker to create a symlink with that same name, which could then be overwritten by Redis when it starts up. ",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Predictable file name",
       "Use of /tmp directory without proper access control"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files with a symlink to the file. This can lead to data loss or corruption, depending on the permissions of the Redis process.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker can create a symlink to an arbitrary file with the name `/tmp/redis-%p.vm` before Redis starts.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the Redis server is running and the ability to create a symlink in the `/tmp` directory before Redis starts. If redis is running as root, the overwritten file can be anything that root has access to.",
	"Affected versions": "Redis versions prior to 2.6",
	"Fix": "The issue was resolved in Redis 2.6 by removing the insecure temporary file creation method. The vulnerable code was removed in commit https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/697af434fbeb2e3ba2ba9687cd283ed1a2734fa5"
