  "cveId": "CVE-2013-0268",
  "date": "2013-02-07",
  "description": "Access to /dev/cpu/*/msr was protected only using filesystem checks. A local uid 0 (root) user with all capabilities dropped could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control for the /dev/cpu/*/msr device files. The MSR driver only relied on filesystem checks, allowing root users with any capability set to write to MSRs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Lack of proper capability checks"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with root privileges could bypass intended capability restrictions and execute arbitrary code in kernel mode by writing to specific MSRs (Model Specific Registers). This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, as the attacker could gain full control over the kernel.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local Access",
      "Exploitation of MSR driver"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have local root access and the ability to open the device file /dev/cpu/*/msr.",
