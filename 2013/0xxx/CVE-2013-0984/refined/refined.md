- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed in the directory server's handling of messages from the network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of network messages leads to potential for code execution with system privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause the directory server to terminate or execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a maliciously crafted message to the directory server via the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network messages to a vulnerable system with Directory Service enabled.
