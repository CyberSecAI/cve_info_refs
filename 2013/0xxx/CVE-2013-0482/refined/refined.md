    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the WebSphere Application Server JAX-WS Web Services Security (WS-Security) runtime, where it does not properly validate message signatures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of XML digital signatures in WS-Security."
    ],
     "impact": "A network attacker could potentially spoof message signatures and execute code by sending a specially-crafted SOAP message.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network attack by sending specially crafted SOAP messages."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to send network messages.",
      "The targeted Web service needs to have XML digital signature in its WS-Security constraint."
