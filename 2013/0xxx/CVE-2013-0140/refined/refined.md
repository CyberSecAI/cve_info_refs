Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a server-side, pre-authenticated SQL injection flaw within the Agent-Handler component of McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO). This component handles communication between agents and the ePO server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  A crafted HTTP request sent during the agent registration process allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This is possible because the ePO server does not properly sanitize or validate input received from agents.
*   **Pre-authentication:** This vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication to the ePO server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the ePO database, potentially including administrative domain credentials that may be cached within the ePO server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers can create new administrator accounts within the web console, granting them unauthorized control over the system.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the ePO server with SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to a complete compromise of the ePO system.
*  **Compromise of Managed Systems:** Since ePO manages other systems, successful exploitation can enable the attacker to execute commands on other systems connected to the ePO server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the ePO Agent-Handler (typically on port tcp/443).
*   **Rogue Agent Registration:** The attack begins with an attacker registering a rogue agent to the ePO server.
*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests to the ePO server to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the local network, able to communicate with the ePO server.
*   No prior authentication to the ePO server is required, due to the pre-authentication nature of the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to craft HTTP requests.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability affects ePO versions 4.6.4 and earlier.
*   McAfee released updates to fix the issue in ePO 4.6.6 and 4.5.7.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jerome Nokin from Verizon Enterprise Solutions.
