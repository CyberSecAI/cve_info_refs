Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-0914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that signal handlers in the Linux kernel do not clear the `sa_restorer` field when new signal handlers are set up during an `execve` system call. This field, which points to an address within the parent process's address space, is inadvertently inherited by child processes after an `execve`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak of the parent process's address space layout to the child process. This is because `sa_restorer` contains an address that is specific to the parent process and not randomized during `execve` as other aspects of process address space.
*   **ASLR Bypass:** The leakage of the parent's address space information allows local attackers to bypass ASLR. ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) is a security feature designed to randomize the memory locations of key data areas of a process. By knowing the address from the parent's address space a malicious child can construct exploits that are ASLR aware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **ASLR Bypass:** The most significant impact is the ability to bypass ASLR. An attacker can use this information leak to reliably deliver exploit payloads, which would otherwise be stopped by ASLR.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The leakage of kernel addresses can potentially expose sensitive information about memory layout to an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** A local user on the system can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **`execve` system call:** The attacker leverages the `execve` system call to trigger the signal handler setup, which inadvertently leaks the address information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Privileges:**  The attacker must be a local user who can execute programs on the system.
*   **Ability to use `sigaction()`:** The attacker's program uses `sigaction()` to inspect the leaked address via `sa_restorer`.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because, the `sa_restorer` field in the signal handlers structure is not properly cleared during the execve system call.
*   The fix involves clearing the `sa_restorer` field. A conditional compilation based on `__ARCH_HAS_SA_RESTORER` is used.
*   The vulnerability is more significant after `execve` due to the replacement of the address space of the process.
*   The fix was implemented by setting sa\_restorer to NULL in the `flush_signal_handlers()` function in `kernel/signal.c`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Red Hat security advisory [RHSA-2013:1051](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013:1051) also mentions CVE-2013-0914 as an ASLR bypass issue.
*   Ubuntu security notices [USN-1794-1](https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1794-1/), [USN-1796-1](https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1796-1/), [USN-1797-1](https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1797-1/), and [USN-1788-1](https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1788-1/) also mention the CVE.
*   The fix is included in Linux kernel version 3.0.69 and 3.2.0-40-generic for ubuntu and 2.6.32-358.14.1 for Redhat.
