  "CVE-2013-0326": [
    {
      "Root cause": "OpenStack Nova base images have world-readable permissions.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The _base images stored in /var/lib/nova/instances/_base have permissions set to -rw-r--r-- making them world-readable."
      ],
      "Impact": "Information disclosure. Any user on the system can read the contents of the base images.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "Local access to the filesystem."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any user with local access to the file system on the compute node can read the base images."
    },
    {
        "Root cause": "Default permissions set on base images created by OpenStack Nova.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Insecure default file permissions."
        ],
        "Impact": "Potential for unauthorized access and viewing of sensitive information within base images by local users.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Local access to the filesystem where base images are stored."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker requires a local user account on the OpenStack compute node."
