Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0783:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2013-0783 in the context of multiple memory safety issues affecting Firefox and Thunderbird, which aligns with the official description of CVE-2013-0783, although the official CVE description lacks specifics.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is rooted in multiple memory safety issues discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. The core of the problem is the potential for a specially crafted webpage to exploit these issues, leading to a denial-of-service condition through an application crash. These issues are related to memory handling in the browser engine.
More detailed cause of the vulnerability is described in the bug report 812380 and is related to WeakMap optimizations which cause use-after-CC-Unlink errors when cycle collector (CC) fails to identify that keys inside WeakMap are alive, resulting in the CC to Unlink live objects.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

Multiple memory safety issues are cited as the underlying weakness. Specifically in Bug 812380, the vulnerability is a use-after-CC-Unlink due to incorrect cycle collector (CC) WeakMap optimizations. This is more concretely a failure in the CC to correctly identify and handle live objects in WeakMaps when optimizations are used.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition in the affected applications. Specifically for bug 812380, use-after-CC-Unlink errors can be combined with errors in Unlink functions to cause badness that are considered security issues. The worst case is potentially arbitrary code execution by exploiting the use-after-free.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted webpage.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious webpage with the specific exploits to trigger the underlying memory safety issues. They also need to trick the user into accessing the page. The attacker is external and remote.
For the use-after-CC-Unlink, as described in Bug 812380,  the attacker needs to be able to manipulate objects via Javascript.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content also mentions the fix for the underlying issue in bug 812380, where the optimization around weak map entries was removed and null checks where added.
- It provides a detailed timeline of the bug, including patches, reviews, and code landing.
- There's also indication of similar issues occurring in multiple Mozilla products like Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey.
- The ubuntu advisory, USN-1729-1, includes CVE-2013-0783, and confirms that scripting needs to be enabled in the browser, and that specially crafted page is used for the attack.
- It is also noted in USN-1729-1 that script is disabled by default in email for Thunderbird, and this can be a potential risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
