- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An error handling issue in Identity Services. When an AppleID certificate failed validation, the user's AppleID was incorrectly assumed to be an empty string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper error handling, specifically not returning NULL when certificate validation fails. This led to incorrect identity determination.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Applications relying on Apple ID authentication could erroneously extend trust if multiple systems belonging to different users entered this state. This could lead to bypassing authentication.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by causing Apple ID certificate validation to fail on multiple devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position where they can influence or cause AppleID certificate validation to fail on multiple systems.
