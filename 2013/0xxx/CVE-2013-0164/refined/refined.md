Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-0164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `openshift-port-proxy-cfg` script's insecure creation of temporary files in the `/tmp` directory. The script uses a predictable file name pattern (`/tmp/openshift-port-proxy-reload.req.?????`) when creating these temporary files which are used as lock files to synchronize proxy reloads. This predictable filename allowed for a time-of-check-time-of-use race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The script uses `mktemp` with a hardcoded prefix located in `/tmp`. While `mktemp` is meant to create unique files, using a predictable pattern allows an attacker to predict the filenames and exploit the race condition.
*   **Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:** There's a window of time between the script checking if a file exists and is empty, and then writing to it, specifically the return code of a script or the number 0. An attacker could potentially replace the file with a symbolic link during this window.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker could potentially overwrite an arbitrary file (writable by root) with either a "0" or "1" by exploiting the race condition.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The arbitrary file overwrite could potentially lead to a denial of service, as the attacker can potentially overwrite critical system configuration files or files required for the operation of `openshift-port-proxy`.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Limited):** Although the overwrite is limited to the content "0" or "1", it is performed with root privileges, therefore, it could be used in a chain of exploits to achieve privilege escalation if other vulnerabilities are present.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local shell access to the server running the vulnerable script (an OpenShift node). It should be noted that in the OpenShift environment, users have access to the node as required to push code with git.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker would need to create a large number of files matching the predictable pattern, wait for the script to check the files, and then replace the checked files with symbolic links to arbitrary files before the script writes to them.
*   **Timing:** The attacker would need to perform the file replacement within a very small timeframe after the original file check. To improve the chances of success, the attacker would need to create a large number of files and replace them in quick succession to increase the likelihood of winning the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Shell Access:** The attacker requires shell access to the target machine.
*   **Timing Control:** The attacker needs to control the timing of file creation, deletion, and symlink creation.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs an understanding of how the `lockwrap` function and temporary files work to exploit the race condition.
*   **Root Privileges (Indirect):** The script is executed as root, but the attacker's initial access does not need to be as root. This makes the exploit more feasible.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is mitigated in OpenShift Online, as gear logins get their own polyinstantiated `/tmp`, meaning each user has their own unique `/tmp` directory, but it is still a problem in other setups without this security feature.
*   The fix involves moving the request files to a special, locked-down directory (`/var/run/openshift-port-proxy`) and using `mktemp` to create unique file names within that directory, which is only writeable by root. This change effectively mitigates the race condition by making the creation of temp files unpredictable and in a safe location.
