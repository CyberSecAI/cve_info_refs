Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `fedora-business-cards` script used a fixed, predictable filename `/tmp/fedora-business-cards-buffer.svg` for creating a temporary SVG file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Usage:** The script creates a temporary file in the `/tmp` directory using a predictable filename. Since `/tmp` is world-writable, this allows an attacker to potentially interfere with the script's operation.
- **Symlink Attack:** An attacker could create a symbolic link with the same name as the temporary file, pointing to another file they wish to overwrite. When the `fedora-business-cards` script attempts to write to the temporary file, it will overwrite the file pointed to by the symlink.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could overwrite any file on the system that the user running `fedora-business-cards` has write access to. This could lead to a wide range of impacts, including data loss, system instability, or privilege escalation if sensitive system files are targeted.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could create a file with the same name and restrictive permissions, which could cause the script to fail and deny its functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where `fedora-business-cards` is being run.
- **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a symbolic link in the `/tmp` directory before the `fedora-business-cards` script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account on the target system.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create files and symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
- The attacker must know when the `fedora-business-cards` script is likely to be run.

**Additional Details:**

- A patch was created to use a proper temporary random filename and clean up the file after use.
- The issue was initially kept private due to security concerns but was later made public.
- The fix was applied to the `fedora-business-cards` package in Fedora 17, 18 and 19.
- The CVE was assigned to this issue.
