{
  "CVE-2013-0247": {
    "Description": "OpenStack Keystone: denial of service through invalid token requests",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in Keystone's token creation error handling, allowing excessively large values for parameters such as user ID, username, password, tenant name, tenant ID, and token size, which are then logged.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Lack of request size limiting",
      "Logging of excessive information"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker could cause a denial of service by sending numerous requests with large values for user parameters, leading to the exhaustion of disk space due to excessive log file growth. This can potentially crash the keystone service or make it unavailable.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote unauthenticated users can send crafted requests to the keystone API's /tokens endpoint with large parameter values.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the keystone API. No special authentication or privileges are needed."
